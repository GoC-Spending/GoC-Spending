        <br>            Founded in 1980, the Radiation Safety Institute of Canada is an independent, national organization dedicated to promoting and advancing radiation safety in the workplace, in the environment and in the community. Our commitment to the principle of good science in plain language® underpins everything we do.<br><br><br>According to United Nations officials, the Radiation Safety Institute of Canada is the only independent organization of its kind in any UN member country.<br><br>We offer a broad range of educational, technical and scientific services to businesses, organizations and individuals across Canada and around the world. The Radiation Safety Institute of Canada is known among our friends and customers for the high quality of our work and the integrity of our people. Our impartial information hotline service receives hundreds of calls and emails every year for information and assistance on workplace radiation questions.<br><br>The Radiation Safety Institute of Canada was founded as an independent, non-partisan, non-governmental body to promote safety in relation to radiation exposure in the workplace and in homes, schools and the environment. Its founding was a direct, independent response to the human disaster in the Elliot Lake uranium mines, where healthy miners had been exposed to excessive amounts of a common radioactive gas (called radon) in the underground mining environment.<br><br>The Radiation Safety Institute of Canada is also a registered charity.<br><br>

                            The Radiation Safety Institute of Canada specializes in the individual monitoring of workers exposed to radiation from radon, thoron and long-lived radioactive dust (LLRD). In fact, the Radiation Safety Institute of Canada is the only organization in North America providing such a service.<br>
<br>
The Radiation Safety Institute of Canadas Radiation Exposure Services, including our patented Personal Alpha Dosimetry (PAD) Service,  is licensed by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) under the Canadian Nuclear Safety and Control Acts  Regulatory Standard S-106, Revision 1.<br>
<br>
In addition, some industrial and environmental work sites require frequent or continuous monitoring (called area monitoring) to ensure that radiation levels are maintained below regulatory exposure limits and guidelines.<br>
<br>
PAD Services and area monitoring, including laboratory analysis, technical support, on-site equipment, quality assurance, quality control and timely reporting of results, is provided through the Radiation Safety Institute of Canadas National Laboratories in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.<br>

                            One of the most effective ways to respond to employee concerns about radiation in the workplace is to have a systematic survey con­ducted by an independent expert like the Radiation Safety Institute of Canada. Our surveys measure the extent of exposure to radiation in the work­place from electromagnetic fields (EMF), X-rays, airborne environmental radon and many other radioactive materials.<br>

                            The Radiation Safety Institute of Canadas home radon testing service follows internationally recognized protocols for quality assurance.  Ten per cent of the radon tests we provide are paired with a duplicate test and three per cent are paired with blanks.  These tests ensure that the measurements are repeatable and not subject to bias from the environment.  At our National Laboratory the E-PERM reader and reference electrets are calibrated annually, and performance tests are performed each year by an independent third party to ensure that our results meet specified accuracy requirements.  The E-PERM components are carefully stored and visually inspected, tested and cleaned before being assembled for each order.  The end result is that we provide you, the customer, with consistently accurate and reliable results. Best of all this rigorous quality assurance comes at no additional cost to you.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, the Institute ensures that every radon client receives the result that they pay for.  If for any reason the device returned by the client is beyond the acceptable quality assurance limits or a result cannot be provided, a retest is supplied by the Institute at no additional charge.<br>
The Radiation Safety Institute of Canada uses a radon monitor called E-PERM to measure radon concentrations. The E-PERM is our choice technology because it is accurate, reliable, easy to use, and environmentally friendly (it can be re-used numerous times). We simply send you an E-PERM by mail, with easy instructions on how and where to set it up. After that, all you have to do is remember to send it back to us to get your results!<br>

              </h4>
          
              Dear Ms. Hargreaves:<br>
<br>
We reviewed your document, which was submitted on May 6, 2011 and titled X-ray Safety for Operators of Baggage Inspection X-ray Systems, against our guidance criteria established for the radiation safety training of operators using baggage x-ray systems in federal facilities or agencies subject to the Canada Labour Code Part II. The document appears to incorporate the established criteria; thus, it may be used for the purpose intended in Section 3.1.2 of Safety Code 29 (i.e., radiation safety training of operators of baggage x-ray systems).<br>
<br>
I have added your organization to our list of agencies that can provide such training to federally regulated facilities. The file on this matter is now closed.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
 Harri Maharaj<br>
 Consumer and Clinical Radiation Protection Bureau<br>
<br>
..Quite frankly Im impressed with your customer service.  Mark, Markham, ON<br>
<br>
I thank you so much for the time and the care that you have put into the response to our inquiries You are very kind in supplying the information that you have. It is very helpful.  Christine, New Brunswick<br>
<br>
I really appreciate this personal level of service  Christopher, Mississauga, ON<br>
<br>
I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed your course. The course content was very well presented and very educational. You are such a kind group of people which made my week very welcoming and comfortable  Bobbie L., Nuclear Medicine Dept. Central Alberta Medical Imaging Services, Ltd.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for a totally fascinating presentation and lecture last night. The feedback from the students was glowing; they so appreciate having impossibly difficult concepts made understandable and accessible  Dee K, University of Waterloo<br>
<br>
Thank you for your prompt and very professional work in examining electromagnetic field levels within the Toronto house we bought last month. We found that very few people involved in home inspection knew anything about this subject area, and it was hard to feel confident with people who didnt actually have any specific qualifications to do this work  Salem A.<br>
<br>
Course was very good and I enjoyed it. After many years, I was in a real classroom environment, daily assignments, daily writing tests and final examination. It was a full university level course  Aman K, PhD, PEng, EKATI Diamond Mine Process Plant<br>
<br>
I took your course on X-ray safety earlier this year. It was very well done and has been a big help to me in determining requirements here in our manufacturing facility  Richard B. GE Healthcare<br>
<br>
Thanks for a very informative week and great presentations for putting a complex subject into simple language  Jean C.<br>

                            The Radiation Safety Institute of Canada specializes in the individual monitoring of workers exposed to radiation from radon, thoron and long-lived radioactive dust (LLRD). In fact, the Radiation Safety Institute of Canada is the only organization in North America providing such a service.<br>
<br>
The Radiation Safety Institute of Canadas Radiation Exposure Services, including our patented Personal Alpha Dosimetry (PAD) Service,  is licensed by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) under the Canadian Nuclear Safety and Control Acts  Regulatory Standard S-106, Revision 1.<br>
<br>
In addition, some industrial and environmental work sites require frequent or continuous monitoring (called area monitoring) to ensure that radiation levels are maintained below regulatory exposure limits and guidelines.<br>
<br>
PAD Services and area monitoring, including laboratory analysis, technical support, on-site equipment, quality assurance, quality control and timely reporting of results, is provided through the Radiation Safety Institute of Canadas National Laboratories in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.<br>

                            One of the most effective ways to respond to employee concerns about radiation in the workplace is to have a systematic survey con­ducted by an independent expert like the Radiation Safety Institute of Canada. Our surveys measure the extent of exposure to radiation in the work­place from electromagnetic fields (EMF), X-rays, airborne environmental radon and many other radioactive materials.<br>

                            The Radiation Safety Institute of Canadas home radon testing service follows internationally recognized protocols for quality assurance.  Ten per cent of the radon tests we provide are paired with a duplicate test and three per cent are paired with blanks.  These tests ensure that the measurements are repeatable and not subject to bias from the environment.  At our National Laboratory the E-PERM reader and reference electrets are calibrated annually, and performance tests are performed each year by an independent third party to ensure that our results meet specified accuracy requirements.  The E-PERM components are carefully stored and visually inspected, tested and cleaned before being assembled for each order.  The end result is that we provide you, the customer, with consistently accurate and reliable results. Best of all this rigorous quality assurance comes at no additional cost to you.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, the Institute ensures that every radon client receives the result that they pay for.  If for any reason the device returned by the client is beyond the acceptable quality assurance limits or a result cannot be provided, a retest is supplied by the Institute at no additional charge.<br>
The Radiation Safety Institute of Canada uses a radon monitor called E-PERM to measure radon concentrations. The E-PERM is our choice technology because it is accurate, reliable, easy to use, and environmentally friendly (it can be re-used numerous times). We simply send you an E-PERM by mail, with easy instructions on how and where to set it up. After that, all you have to do is remember to send it back to us to get your results!<br>

              </h4>
          
              Dear Ms. Hargreaves:<br>
<br>
We reviewed your document, which was submitted on May 6, 2011 and titled X-ray Safety for Operators of Baggage Inspection X-ray Systems, against our guidance criteria established for the radiation safety training of operators using baggage x-ray systems in federal facilities or agencies subject to the Canada Labour Code Part II. The document appears to incorporate the established criteria; thus, it may be used for the purpose intended in Section 3.1.2 of Safety Code 29 (i.e., radiation safety training of operators of baggage x-ray systems).<br>
<br>
I have added your organization to our list of agencies that can provide such training to federally regulated facilities. The file on this matter is now closed.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
 Harri Maharaj<br>
 Consumer and Clinical Radiation Protection Bureau<br>
<br>
..Quite frankly Im impressed with your customer service.  Mark, Markham, ON<br>
<br>
I thank you so much for the time and the care that you have put into the response to our inquiries You are very kind in supplying the information that you have. It is very helpful.  Christine, New Brunswick<br>
<br>
I really appreciate this personal level of service  Christopher, Mississauga, ON<br>
<br>
I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed your course. The course content was very well presented and very educational. You are such a kind group of people which made my week very welcoming and comfortable  Bobbie L., Nuclear Medicine Dept. Central Alberta Medical Imaging Services, Ltd.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for a totally fascinating presentation and lecture last night. The feedback from the students was glowing; they so appreciate having impossibly difficult concepts made understandable and accessible  Dee K, University of Waterloo<br>
<br>
Thank you for your prompt and very professional work in examining electromagnetic field levels within the Toronto house we bought last month. We found that very few people involved in home inspection knew anything about this subject area, and it was hard to feel confident with people who didnt actually have any specific qualifications to do this work  Salem A.<br>
<br>
Course was very good and I enjoyed it. After many years, I was in a real classroom environment, daily assignments, daily writing tests and final examination. It was a full university level course  Aman K, PhD, PEng, EKATI Diamond Mine Process Plant<br>
<br>
I took your course on X-ray safety earlier this year. It was very well done and has been a big help to me in determining requirements here in our manufacturing facility  Richard B. GE Healthcare<br>
<br>
Thanks for a very informative week and great presentations for putting a complex subject into simple language  Jean C.<br>
