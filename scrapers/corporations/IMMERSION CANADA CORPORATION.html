                            MicroScribe® systems are lightweight and easy-to-use portable CMM articulated arms and digitizers. To measure any object, users simply collect data points using the stylus. MicroScribe portable CMMs allow the end-user to create everything from basic to complex geometry and/or accurately compare CAD data to a physical part. By interfacing directly into leading graphic arts, reverse engineering, and metrology applications, and many more, MicroScribe systems become a very powerful tool with a very small learning curve.

                            The Endoscopy AccuTouch System includes three types of endoscopic procedures: flexible bronchoscopy, and upper and lower gastrointestinal flexible endoscopy. Endoscopic procedures are some of the most commonly practiced medical procedures today, but the motor skills necessary to perform these procedures are difficult to train and assess. The Endoscopy AccuTouch Simulator is a realistic, computer-based system for teaching and assessing motor skills and cognitive knowledge, enabling novices and experienced physicians to practice in a safe environment. Using real-time computer graphics, including anatomic models developed from actual patient data and a robotic interface device, force is transmitted through the flexible scope to provide tactile sensations mimicking the actual feel of a procedure.

                            The CathLabVR System allows clinicians to practice endovascular procedures such as PTCA, stenting, and cardiac pacing. Endovascular procedures require careful attention to interpretation of the fluoroscopic image as well as the subtle feel transmitted through guide wires, catheters, and other interventional devices. This Immersion Medical simulator, which simulates the look and feel of actual procedures, helps clinicians to develop skills prior to performing on patients and to maintain those skills throughout their professional practice.

The result is unmatched realistic simulation of textures, liquids, gravitational fields, and biological materials, to name a few possibilities. <br>
Two or more Impulse Engines can be interfaced within a single system to create exciting multiuser force feedback experiences from games to group participation in simulated surgeries.<br>

                            Next-generation TouchSense(R) Vibration for console video games matches the realism expected of next-generation high-definition graphics and high-fidelity. Hardware and software components are used both to deliver current dual-motor system performance and provide additional operating modes to extend the range of possible tactile effects. Compared to current dual-motor systems, next-generation TouchSense(R) vibration technology supports: <br>
- Richer, and even more realistic and complex force feedback effects. This is possible by supplying a much broader frequency range and by exerting more precise control over the vibration actuator. Easy-to-use authoring tools allow developers to fully take advantage of these capabilities. <br>
- Faster response/lower latency for a tighter synchronization with onscreen graphic and audio events. <br>
- Lower battery consumption for equivalent sized motors; less weight (a convenience for implementing motion control); and deployment in the same or less space. <br>
- Backward compatibility for tactile effects in games designed for current dual-motor systems. <br>
- No increase in cost, and in many cases, lower cost, by reducing two motors to only one actuator. <br>

                            The CyberTouch(TM) system is a tactile feedback option for Immersion&#39;s wired CyberGlove instrumented glove. It features small vibrotactile stimulators on each finger and the palm of the CyberGlove system. Each stimulator can be individually programmed to vary the strength of touch sensation. The array of stimulators can generate simple sensations such as pulses or sustained vibration, and they can be used in combination to produce complex tactile feedback patterns. Software developers can design their own actuation profiles. The CyberTouch tactile feedback option is essential to anyone serious about using their hands to interact with objects in a virtual world.

Vascular Access Medical Training Simulator<br>
The CathSim® AccuTouch® System was introduced in 1998 and over 700 systems have been installed worldwide since that time. Customers report the system supplies a highly realistic learning environment that teaches the proper technique and sequencing for IV access. It exposes students to a wide variety of cases, and in that way, improves student confidence and understanding. In addition, the system has brought cost savings, due to less need for supplies, and instructor time savings, because more independent learning is possible. Case studies detailing use of the system at the following organizations can be found at www.immersion.com/medical/products/vascular/case_studies.php:<br>
- Children&#39;s Hospital of Pittsburgh<br>
- Indiana University School of Medicine<br>
- Madisonville Community College<br>
- Montgomery County, Maryland  Fire Department<br>
- University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey<br>
<br>
Bronchoscopy Medical Traning Simulator<br>
The Endoscopy AccuTouch® System with bronchoscopy modules was introduced in 1999, and since that time hundreds of customers have installed the system into their training programs. They report that the system provides faster learning and more realistic experiences, no-risk training, and therefore improved patient safety, increased student satisfaction, and the ability to act as a qualification tool for clinical procedures. Some of their experiences can be found at www.immersion.com/medical/products/endoscopy/bronch/case_studies.php, including from:<br>
- Northwestern University <br>
- Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center <br>
- University of Chicago Hospitals <br>
<br>
Lower GI Medical Training Simulator<br>
The Endoscopy AccuTouch® System with lower GI modules was introduced in 1999, and since that time, hundreds of customers have integrated the system into their training programs. They report that the systems force feedback action (haptics) makes the procedures feel real, and that its realistic learning environment helps reduce the time needed for residents to gain proficiency. The system allows independent learning in nonthreatening situations, and promotes patient safety through developing the skills needed to perform colonoscopies faster. Some of our customers experiences are documented at www.immersion.com/medical/products/endoscopy/lgi/case_studies.php, including those from:<br>
- Philadelphia Gastroenterology Training Group <br>
- Rush University Medical Center <br>
- Ft. Wayne Medical Education Program <br>
- University of Aberdeen <br>
<br>
Endovascular Medical Trainint Simulator<br>
Users of the Endovascular AccuTouch® System report that the system provides a very safe, controlled environment in which criterion-based training can be established to control the learning process. They further believe that the system helps reduce the learning curve and could minimize complications and the costs associated with them. The systems cases progressively increase in difficulty to expand learning and help transfer good technique to real procedures. Two doctors who used the system in a training program hosted by Medtronic, a co-developer of the system, have reported on their experiences, which can be found at www.immersion.com/medical/products/endovascular/case_studies.php:<br>
- Dr. Alan Yeung, Stanford University<br>
- Dr. Campbell Rogers, Brigham &amp; Womens Hospital <br>
<br>
Hysteroscopy Medical Training Simulator<br>
The Hysteroscopy AccuTouch® System was introduced in 2004 and is the first virtual reality trainer of its kind. The System uses actual instruments augmented with force feeback to navigate within a 3D virtual model. Early reports indicate that it will become a welcome addition to gynecological training programs. Read the experiences of two users of the system at www.immersion.com/medical/products/hysteroscopy/case_studies.php:<br>

                            MicroScribe® systems are lightweight and easy-to-use portable CMM articulated arms and digitizers. To measure any object, users simply collect data points using the stylus. MicroScribe portable CMMs allow the end-user to create everything from basic to complex geometry and/or accurately compare CAD data to a physical part. By interfacing directly into leading graphic arts, reverse engineering, and metrology applications, and many more, MicroScribe systems become a very powerful tool with a very small learning curve.

                            The Endoscopy AccuTouch System includes three types of endoscopic procedures: flexible bronchoscopy, and upper and lower gastrointestinal flexible endoscopy. Endoscopic procedures are some of the most commonly practiced medical procedures today, but the motor skills necessary to perform these procedures are difficult to train and assess. The Endoscopy AccuTouch Simulator is a realistic, computer-based system for teaching and assessing motor skills and cognitive knowledge, enabling novices and experienced physicians to practice in a safe environment. Using real-time computer graphics, including anatomic models developed from actual patient data and a robotic interface device, force is transmitted through the flexible scope to provide tactile sensations mimicking the actual feel of a procedure.

                            The CathLabVR System allows clinicians to practice endovascular procedures such as PTCA, stenting, and cardiac pacing. Endovascular procedures require careful attention to interpretation of the fluoroscopic image as well as the subtle feel transmitted through guide wires, catheters, and other interventional devices. This Immersion Medical simulator, which simulates the look and feel of actual procedures, helps clinicians to develop skills prior to performing on patients and to maintain those skills throughout their professional practice.

                            Next-generation TouchSense(R) Vibration for console video games matches the realism expected of next-generation high-definition graphics and high-fidelity. Hardware and software components are used both to deliver current dual-motor system performance and provide additional operating modes to extend the range of possible tactile effects. Compared to current dual-motor systems, next-generation TouchSense(R) vibration technology supports: <br>
- Richer, and even more realistic and complex force feedback effects. This is possible by supplying a much broader frequency range and by exerting more precise control over the vibration actuator. Easy-to-use authoring tools allow developers to fully take advantage of these capabilities. <br>
- Faster response/lower latency for a tighter synchronization with onscreen graphic and audio events. <br>
- Lower battery consumption for equivalent sized motors; less weight (a convenience for implementing motion control); and deployment in the same or less space. <br>
- Backward compatibility for tactile effects in games designed for current dual-motor systems. <br>
- No increase in cost, and in many cases, lower cost, by reducing two motors to only one actuator. <br>

                            The CyberTouch(TM) system is a tactile feedback option for Immersion&#39;s wired CyberGlove instrumented glove. It features small vibrotactile stimulators on each finger and the palm of the CyberGlove system. Each stimulator can be individually programmed to vary the strength of touch sensation. The array of stimulators can generate simple sensations such as pulses or sustained vibration, and they can be used in combination to produce complex tactile feedback patterns. Software developers can design their own actuation profiles. The CyberTouch tactile feedback option is essential to anyone serious about using their hands to interact with objects in a virtual world.

              BMW iDrive controller<br>
Leading auto manufacturer, BMW, has licensed Immersion&#39;s TouchSense technology to create the automotive industry&#39;s first intuitive information and control system called iDrive. This system allows drivers to access numerous operations such as climate, entertainment, and navigation with a single control. ALPS Electric, the world&#39;s largest electronics components supplier, manufactures the iDrive Controller and is a preferred supplier of TouchSense-enabled controls.<br>
<br>
Vascular Access Medical Training Simulator<br>
The CathSim® AccuTouch® System was introduced in 1998 and over 700 systems have been installed worldwide since that time. Customers report the system supplies a highly realistic learning environment that teaches the proper technique and sequencing for IV access. It exposes students to a wide variety of cases, and in that way, improves student confidence and understanding. In addition, the system has brought cost savings, due to less need for supplies, and instructor time savings, because more independent learning is possible. Case studies detailing use of the system at the following organizations can be found at www.immersion.com/medical/products/vascular/case_studies.php:<br>
- Children&#39;s Hospital of Pittsburgh<br>
- Indiana University School of Medicine<br>
- Madisonville Community College<br>
- Montgomery County, Maryland  Fire Department<br>
- University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey<br>
<br>
Bronchoscopy Medical Traning Simulator<br>
The Endoscopy AccuTouch® System with bronchoscopy modules was introduced in 1999, and since that time hundreds of customers have installed the system into their training programs. They report that the system provides faster learning and more realistic experiences, no-risk training, and therefore improved patient safety, increased student satisfaction, and the ability to act as a qualification tool for clinical procedures. Some of their experiences can be found at www.immersion.com/medical/products/endoscopy/bronch/case_studies.php, including from:<br>
- Northwestern University <br>
- Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center <br>
- University of Chicago Hospitals <br>
<br>
Lower GI Medical Training Simulator<br>
The Endoscopy AccuTouch® System with lower GI modules was introduced in 1999, and since that time, hundreds of customers have integrated the system into their training programs. They report that the systems force feedback action (haptics) makes the procedures feel real, and that its realistic learning environment helps reduce the time needed for residents to gain proficiency. The system allows independent learning in nonthreatening situations, and promotes patient safety through developing the skills needed to perform colonoscopies faster. Some of our customers experiences are documented at www.immersion.com/medical/products/endoscopy/lgi/case_studies.php, including those from:<br>
- Philadelphia Gastroenterology Training Group <br>
- Rush University Medical Center <br>
- Ft. Wayne Medical Education Program <br>
- University of Aberdeen <br>
<br>
Endovascular Medical Trainint Simulator<br>
Users of the Endovascular AccuTouch® System report that the system provides a very safe, controlled environment in which criterion-based training can be established to control the learning process. They further believe that the system helps reduce the learning curve and could minimize complications and the costs associated with them. The systems cases progressively increase in difficulty to expand learning and help transfer good technique to real procedures. Two doctors who used the system in a training program hosted by Medtronic, a co-developer of the system, have reported on their experiences, which can be found at www.immersion.com/medical/products/endovascular/case_studies.php:<br>
- Dr. Alan Yeung, Stanford University<br>
- Dr. Campbell Rogers, Brigham &amp; Womens Hospital <br>
<br>
Hysteroscopy Medical Training Simulator<br>
The Hysteroscopy AccuTouch® System was introduced in 2004 and is the first virtual reality trainer of its kind. The System uses actual instruments augmented with force feeback to navigate within a 3D virtual model. Early reports indicate that it will become a welcome addition to gynecological training programs. Read the experiences of two users of the system at www.immersion.com/medical/products/hysteroscopy/case_studies.php:<br>
- Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center<br>
- Dr. Malcolm G. Munro <br>
