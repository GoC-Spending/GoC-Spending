        <br>            A PARTNERSHIP OF PLANNERS AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS<br><br>Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates offers a wide range of Planning and <br>Environmental Design services from its offices in Saskatoon and <br>Regina, Saskatchewan.  Since the inception of its parent firm in <br>1969, and the opening of its Saskatoon office in 1978, the firm <br>has evolved to its present complement of professional staff with <br>backgrounds in landscape architecture, community and regional <br>planning, geography, environmental studies, remote sensing,  <br>urban design, social sciences and graphic arts.  In addition to <br>its own resources, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates routinely <br>collaborates with professionals from the related disciplines of <br>architecture, engineering and biological sciences.  Using an <br>approach in which consultation and interaction with all <br>identified interests is emphasized, the firm brings to its <br>assignments a broad base of project experience in the <br>translation <br>of client and stakeholder needs and interests into practical, <br>innovative planning and design solutions.  This work has been <br>recognized with numerous awards, at the provincial, national and <br>international levels.  The firm specializes in work in the <br>Canadian Prairies and the north.<br><br><br>PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH<br><br>Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates recognize that responsible planning <br>and <br>design must be based upon:<br><br>-     an understanding of the interrelationships between the     <br>      numerous biological, physical, social and economic       <br>      attributes of land systems;<br><br>-     the relationship of this understanding with the goals and <br>      objectives of the development program; and<br><br>-     a  commitment to an interdisciplinary approach and to <br>      implementation.<br><br><br>This philosophy asserts that a thorough knowledge of a project <br>area is necessary in order to realize its full potential, to <br>assess and predict a project&#39;s biophysical, aesthetic and <br>socioeconomic impact and to provide a foundation upon which <br>rational and responsive proposals can be built.  In association <br>with this requirement, is our belief that close consultation <br>must <br>be maintained with clients and other identified interests.  This <br>emphasis upon the combination of high quality work and close <br>client consultation rests at the heart of our success.<br><br>Application of this philosophy requires that an <br>interdisciplinary <br>approach be taken to the process of analysis, planning and <br>design.  Therefore, we have assembled a team of experienced <br>professionals and technical support staff, each member of which <br>has acquired a high level of expertise in his or her own field. <br>Collaboration and team work, as integral components of an <br>interdisciplinary approach, are not new to any of the <br>individuals <br>in the firm.  Through this approach, we are able to provide <br>clients with a product which reflects the combined skills and <br>experience of the partners and staff within the firm.<br><br>Currently, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates undertake approximately 60 <br>projects each year and, since 1969, the firm has been involved <br>in <br>assignments within the following categories:<br><br><br>PRINCIPAL FIELDS OF ACTIVITY<br><br>COMMUNITY AND LAND USE PLANNING<br>Development Plans / Basic Planning Statements / Official Plans<br>Sector Policy Plans<br>Zoning Controls and Bylaws<br>Subdivision Planning and Approvals (Residential, Commercial, <br>Industrial, Recreational)<br>Municipal Board Submissions<br>Transportation Planning Studies<br>First Nation Community Planning<br><br>URBAN DESIGN<br>Urban Revitalization<br>Heritage Planning<br>Streetscaping<br>Commercial, Industrial &amp; Residential Subdivision Planning<br>Corridor Planning<br><br>REGIONAL PLANNING<br>Regional Land Use &amp; Resource Planning<br>Economic Development Planning<br><br>ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING<br>Resource Inventory &amp; Analysis<br>Social Impact Assessment <br>Economic Impact Assessment<br>Site Restoration and Reclamation<br>Resource Conservation Policy Planning<br>Visual Impact Assessment / Mitigation<br>Resource Management Planning<br><br>TOURISM &amp; RECREATION PLANNING<br>Tourism Feasibility Studies and Business Plans<br>Tourism Destination Strategies<br>National, Provincial, Regional &amp; Urban Parks Planning<br>Waterway Planning<br>Heritage Tourism Planning<br>Parks and Open Space Systems Planning<br><br>SITE PLANNING &amp; DESIGN<br>Housing<br>Civic, Industrial and Institutional Buildings and Complexes<br>Public Utilities / Infrastructure Site Planning and Design<br>Recreational Site Planning<br>Historic Site Restoration &amp; Interpretation<br>Construction Administration<br><br>INTERIOR LANDSCAPE DESIGN<br>Planting Design<br>Irrigation Design<br>Fountains / Features Design<br>Construction Administration<br><br>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANNING<br>Strategic Plans<br>Regional Economic Development Analysis<br>Community Economic Development Strategies<br><br>POLICY RESEARCH AND PLANNING<br>Municipal Policy Development<br>Corporate Policies and Procedures<br><br><br>AWARDS<br><br>1996		Canadian Society of Landscape Architects<br>		National Honour Award and<br>		Prairie Region Honour Award<br>		for Wanuskewin Heritage Park, Saskatoon<br><br>1996		Design Council of Saskatchewan<br>		Premier&#39;s Awards for Excellence in Design<br>		Award of Excellence<br>		for Wanuskewin Heritage Park, Saskatoon<br><br>1996		Mendel Sculpture Garden Competition<br>		Meewasin Valley Authority<br>		Saskatoon, SK<br>		First Runner-up<br><br>1990		Waterfront Center Annual Award<br>		for the firm&#39;s contributions to the Meewasin     <br>                Valley Project, Saskatoon, a quality waterfront <br>                project selected in a juried competition<br><br>1990		Canadian Society of Landscape Architects<br>		Prairie Region Merit Award<br>		for Innovation Bowl, Innovation Place, Saskatoon<br><br>1989		Canadian Society of Landscape Architects<br>		Prairie Region Citation Award<br>		for the Saskatoon Downtown Improvement Plan<br><br>1988		Design Council of Saskatchewan<br>		Premier&#39;s Awards for Excellence in Design<br>		Honourable Mention <br>		for Kinsmen Play Village, Saskatoon<br><br>1986		Design Council of Saskatchewan<br>		Premier&#39;s Awards for Excellence in Design<br>		Honourable Mention<br>		for Clearwater River Management Plan <br><br><br>PERSONNEL /  IN-HOUSE CAPABILITY<br><br>With a full complement of professional, technical and clerical <br>staff, our firm is fully capable of fulfilling complex project <br>requirements.

                            A comprehensive community or regional development plan is the <br>
product of integrated input of four major types:<br>
<br>
-	analysis of natural, human, cultural and visual <br>
        resources;<br>
<br>
-	analysis of existing land use and regional <br>
        interrelationships;<br>
<br>
-	identification of government policies and programs (at <br>
        all levels); and<br>
<br>
-	determination of community needs and desires (as <br>
        identified through public participation programs).<br>
<br>
<br>
Within this general framework, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates design a <br>
community or regional planning process to meet specific Client <br>
requirements.  Studies such as these often result in the <br>
provision of the following:<br>
<br>
Land use planning schemes for communities, including <br>
recommendations for future urban land uses, transportation <br>
patterns, open space systems, redevelopment strategies and <br>
effective use of infrastructure;<br>
<br>
Planning statements, development plans and draft official <br>
planning and zoning bylaws on behalf of communities for <br>
Ministerial adoption;<br>
<br>
Design coordination of engineering, architectural and landscape <br>
architectural consultants;<br>
<br>
Regional land use policies and strategies, including <br>
recommendations for recreation, residential, agriculture, <br>
resource extraction and other industrial development, tourism and <br>
landscape conservation activities; and<br>
<br>
Feasibility studies which examine the socioeconomic benefits and <br>
development costs of particular projects.<br>

                            A comprehensive community or regional development plan is the <br>
product of integrated input of four major types:<br>
<br>
-	analysis of natural, human, cultural and visual <br>
        resources;<br>
<br>
-	analysis of existing land use and regional <br>
        interrelationships;<br>
<br>
-	identification of government policies and programs (at <br>
        all levels); and<br>
<br>
-	determination of community needs and desires (as <br>
        identified through public participation programs).<br>
<br>
<br>
Within this general framework, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates design a <br>
community or regional planning process to meet specific Client <br>
requirements.  Studies such as these often result in the <br>
provision of the following:<br>
<br>
Land use planning schemes for communities, including <br>
recommendations for future urban land uses, transportation <br>
patterns, open space systems, redevelopment strategies and <br>
effective use of infrastructure;<br>
<br>
Planning statements, development plans and draft official <br>
planning and zoning bylaws on behalf of communities for <br>
Ministerial adoption;<br>
<br>
Design coordination of engineering, architectural and landscape <br>
architectural consultants;<br>
<br>
Regional land use policies and strategies, including <br>
recommendations for recreation, residential, agriculture, <br>
resource extraction and other industrial development, tourism and <br>
landscape conservation activities; and<br>
<br>
Feasibility studies which examine the socioeconomic benefits and <br>
development costs of particular projects.<br>

                            The increasing emphasis on the upgrading of urban environments <br>
has been recognized as a significant contributor to the <br>
enrichment of our daily lives.  We believe that stronger positive <br>
urban images, as reflected in streetscape development programs, <br>
will continue to form an important addition to the urban <br>
environment.  Comprehensive and integrated streetscape planning <br>
has thus become a significant area of involvement for Crosby <br>
Hanna &amp; Associates.<br>
<br>
This type of planning work involves the analysis of existing <br>
development patterns and land uses, pedestrian and vehicle <br>
traffic flows, climatic influences, zoning bylaws and community <br>
interests, as well as the determination of appropriate themes, <br>
urban focal points and images.  The scope of such programs can be <br>
as far-reaching as street closure, park redevelopment, building <br>
facade renovation, complementary economic development and <br>
marketing images and development of new redevelopment <br>
organizations, or as straightforward as decorative paving, <br>
selective planting and development of pedestrian interest points. <br>
 The specific requirements and final product are dependent upon <br>
the particular project and Client aspirations.<br>

                            As an important and fundamental component of our operations, <br>
detailed site planning and design involves professional landscape <br>
architects at various stages of the development process, <br>
including:<br>
<br>
	Preparation of preliminary site development plans, <br>
elevations, sections and character sketches to illustrate <br>
development concepts;<br>
<br>
	Preparation of contract documents, including detailed <br>
design and construction drawings and specifications for all <br>
aspects of site development, including the locations of all site <br>
features and plantings, site grading, irrigation design and <br>
construction details;<br>
<br>
	Application, on behalf of clients, for any construction <br>
approvals that may be required; and<br>
<br>
	Full tender and contract administration services.<br>
<br>
<br>
Successful site planning and design requires a thorough knowledge <br>
of the site components, plant species and their characteristics <br>
and environmental requirements, micro-climatic influences, <br>
construction techniques, general and technical specifications and <br>
construction contract administration.  Our extensive site <br>
planning and design experience throughout the prairie provinces <br>

                            With a growing emphasis on high quality urban development, more <br>
and more projects are extending their site development inward to <br>
facilitate a greater integration of interior and exterior &quot;open <br>
space&quot;.  Interior landscaping is a common means of providing this <br>
integration while ensuring a pleasant year-round interior <br>
setting. Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have pioneered much of the <br>
interior landscape design on the Prairies.<br>
<br>
This design work calls for a thorough knowledge of plant species <br>
and their requirements, construction techniques, lighting and <br>
irrigation technology, and architectural motif and intent.  The <br>
presence of such expertise within the firm ensures that interior <br>
landscape designs will reflect the intended architectural <br>
character of the projects, whether they are institutional, <br>
commercial or residential in nature.<br>

                            The assessment of environmental impacts of proposed developments <br>
or land use initiatives is now a common requirement for project <br>
approvals.  Due to the very broad scope and comprehensive nature <br>
of such assessments, and because of our commitment to a strong <br>
interdisciplinary approach, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates typically <br>
undertake this type of work as joint efforts with other <br>
professionals with appropriate expertise in other disciplines.<br>
<br>
Further, it is our belief that environmental assessment is a <br>
fundamental part of any major land use study and that <br>
environmental analysis / assessment, when built into the planning <br>
process, saves Client time and dollars by identifying <br>
opportunities and constraints prior to plan formulation.  Indeed, <br>
sound land use plans should, as a matter of course, meet many of <br>
the requirements of a formal environmental assessment.<br>

                            The preparation of resource management plans requires the <br>
consideration not only of the resource base and its associated <br>
capabilities and sensitivities, but also of the needs and <br>
priorities of those whose activities can or do affect the <br>
integrity of resource values.  Such plans can relate to areas as <br>
small as a few acres to regional areas thousands of square miles <br>
in extent.  Clearly, the integration of resource requirements <br>
with stakeholder interests and resource manager capabilities is <br>
the key to a successful resource management plan.<br>

                            Construction, ongoing land use activity and natural processes can <br>
all result in site degradation requiring restoration.  Site <br>
restoration can take many forms, ranging from structural <br>
solutions to re-establishment of near-natural conditions.  <br>
Appropriate restoration strategies and techniques are dependent <br>
upon the nature of the degradation, budget considerations, <br>
intended after-use of the site and Client goals.<br>

                            Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have completed numerous planning <br>
studies for parks ranging in size and complexity from small urban <br>
neighbourhood parks, through historic and heritage parks, to <br>
large provincial and national parks.  Incorporated into the <br>
process of planning such parks are analyses of natural, cultural <br>
and visual resources, government programs, policies and <br>
legislation, regional situation and public wants and needs.  <br>
Where required, detailed biophysical assessments are included as <br>
integral study components.<br>
<br>
Through the application of various data collection and analysis <br>
techniques and many years of park planning experience across the <br>
prairie provinces, the firm provides the following:<br>
<br>
Determination of recreation trends and community / regional open <br>
space and park needs;<br>
<br>
Preparation of open space guidelines for urban centres;<br>
<br>
Determination of significant natural, cultural and visual <br>
resources suitable for development, interpretation, conservation <br>
and/or management;<br>
<br>
Determination of programs capable of fulfilling Clients&#39; <br>
objectives;<br>
<br>
Preparation of objectives, policy statements, development and <br>
conservation guidelines and administrative structure formulation; <br>
and<br>
<br>
Comprehensive park plans, ranging from general conceptual plans, <br>
through overall Master Plans, to preliminary designs and detailed <br>
site plans for facility development.<br>

                            Over the years, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have been involved in <br>
the full range of tourism and recreation planning, which may be <br>
as general as broad provincial strategies, or as specific as <br>
individual site development proposals and project-specific <br>
business plans.  This type of planning is based upon the need to <br>
understand existing and expected tourism and recreation patterns, <br>
trends and development expectations, in association with a <br>
comprehensive examination of the natural and cultural resource <br>
base, existing land use patterns, development opportunities and <br>
constraints, and government policies and programs.<br>
<br>
The firm provides the following professional services in the <br>
field of tourism and recreation planning:<br>
<br>
Provincial, regional and/or sectoral tourism strategies;<br>
<br>
Tourism and recreation theme studies and Master Plans;<br>
<br>
Tourism and recreation corridor studies; and<br>
<br>
Site development plans, feasibility assessments and business <br>
plans for such facilities as resort complexes, tourism nodes and <br>
destination areas, campgrounds and visitor centres.<br>

First Nations across northwestern Ontario, Manitoba and <br>
Saskatchewan with a broad range of consulting services.  In <br>
Saskatchewan, our First Nations clients have been numerous and <br>

types.  In addition to numerous site planning and landscape <br>
design projects for new Reserve schools across the province, <br>
commissions have included comprehensive community plans, land use <br>
and capital plans and land selection studies under the Treaty <br>
Land Entitlement program.<br>

                            Interpretive planning provides the means by which people can more <br>
fully appreciate the cultural and natural values of their living <br>
environment.  Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have long recognized the <br>
importance of these values, and have completed a number of <br>
special studies which relate to the interpretation of significant <br>
natural and cultural resources.<br>
<br>
Studies such as these commonly include the following:<br>
<br>
Establishment of management policies and strategies providing for <br>
protection of interpretive resources while, at the same time, <br>
providing opportunities for interpretation; and<br>
<br>
Planning of interpretive systems, including such facilities and <br>
elements as trails, signage, visitor reception areas and <br>
associated recreation facilities.<br>

                            The increasing emphasis on the upgrading of urban environments <br>
has been recognized as a significant contributor to the <br>
enrichment of our daily lives.  We believe that stronger positive <br>
urban images, as reflected in streetscape development programs, <br>
will continue to form an important addition to the urban <br>
environment.  Comprehensive and integrated streetscape planning <br>
has thus become a significant area of involvement for Crosby <br>
Hanna &amp; Associates.<br>
<br>
This type of planning work involves the analysis of existing <br>
development patterns and land uses, pedestrian and vehicle <br>
traffic flows, climatic influences, zoning bylaws and community <br>
interests, as well as the determination of appropriate themes, <br>
urban focal points and images.  The scope of such programs can be <br>
as far-reaching as street closure, park redevelopment, building <br>
facade renovation, complementary economic development and <br>
marketing images and development of new redevelopment <br>
organizations, or as straightforward as decorative paving, <br>
selective planting and development of pedestrian interest points. <br>
 The specific requirements and final product are dependent upon <br>
the particular project and Client aspirations.<br>

                            As an important and fundamental component of our operations, <br>
detailed site planning and design involves professional landscape <br>
architects at various stages of the development process, <br>
including:<br>
<br>
	Preparation of preliminary site development plans, <br>
elevations, sections and character sketches to illustrate <br>
development concepts;<br>
<br>
	Preparation of contract documents, including detailed <br>
design and construction drawings and specifications for all <br>
aspects of site development, including the locations of all site <br>
features and plantings, site grading, irrigation design and <br>
construction details;<br>
<br>
	Application, on behalf of clients, for any construction <br>
approvals that may be required; and<br>
<br>
	Full tender and contract administration services.<br>
<br>
<br>
Successful site planning and design requires a thorough knowledge <br>
of the site components, plant species and their characteristics <br>
and environmental requirements, micro-climatic influences, <br>
construction techniques, general and technical specifications and <br>
construction contract administration.  Our extensive site <br>
planning and design experience throughout the prairie provinces <br>
and in the north ensures the client of an attractive, functional <br>
and cost-effective product.<br>

                            With a growing emphasis on high quality urban development, more <br>
and more projects are extending their site development inward to <br>
facilitate a greater integration of interior and exterior &quot;open <br>
space&quot;.  Interior landscaping is a common means of providing this <br>
integration while ensuring a pleasant year-round interior <br>
setting. Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have pioneered much of the <br>
interior landscape design on the Prairies.<br>
<br>
This design work calls for a thorough knowledge of plant species <br>
and their requirements, construction techniques, lighting and <br>
irrigation technology, and architectural motif and intent.  The <br>
presence of such expertise within the firm ensures that interior <br>
landscape designs will reflect the intended architectural <br>
character of the projects, whether they are institutional, <br>
commercial or residential in nature.<br>

                            The assessment of environmental impacts of proposed developments <br>
or land use initiatives is now a common requirement for project <br>
approvals.  Due to the very broad scope and comprehensive nature <br>
of such assessments, and because of our commitment to a strong <br>
interdisciplinary approach, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates typically <br>
undertake this type of work as joint efforts with other <br>
professionals with appropriate expertise in other disciplines.<br>
<br>
Further, it is our belief that environmental assessment is a <br>
fundamental part of any major land use study and that <br>
environmental analysis / assessment, when built into the planning <br>
process, saves Client time and dollars by identifying <br>
opportunities and constraints prior to plan formulation.  Indeed, <br>
sound land use plans should, as a matter of course, meet many of <br>
the requirements of a formal environmental assessment.<br>

                            The preparation of resource management plans requires the <br>
consideration not only of the resource base and its associated <br>
capabilities and sensitivities, but also of the needs and <br>
priorities of those whose activities can or do affect the <br>
integrity of resource values.  Such plans can relate to areas as <br>
small as a few acres to regional areas thousands of square miles <br>
in extent.  Clearly, the integration of resource requirements <br>
with stakeholder interests and resource manager capabilities is <br>
the key to a successful resource management plan.<br>

                            Construction, ongoing land use activity and natural processes can <br>
all result in site degradation requiring restoration.  Site <br>
restoration can take many forms, ranging from structural <br>
solutions to re-establishment of near-natural conditions.  <br>
Appropriate restoration strategies and techniques are dependent <br>
upon the nature of the degradation, budget considerations, <br>
intended after-use of the site and Client goals.<br>

                            Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have completed numerous planning <br>
studies for parks ranging in size and complexity from small urban <br>
neighbourhood parks, through historic and heritage parks, to <br>
large provincial and national parks.  Incorporated into the <br>
process of planning such parks are analyses of natural, cultural <br>
and visual resources, government programs, policies and <br>
legislation, regional situation and public wants and needs.  <br>
Where required, detailed biophysical assessments are included as <br>
integral study components.<br>
<br>
Through the application of various data collection and analysis <br>
techniques and many years of park planning experience across the <br>
prairie provinces, the firm provides the following:<br>
<br>
Determination of recreation trends and community / regional open <br>
space and park needs;<br>
<br>
Preparation of open space guidelines for urban centres;<br>
<br>
Determination of significant natural, cultural and visual <br>
resources suitable for development, interpretation, conservation <br>
and/or management;<br>
<br>
Determination of programs capable of fulfilling Clients&#39; <br>
objectives;<br>
<br>
Preparation of objectives, policy statements, development and <br>
conservation guidelines and administrative structure formulation; <br>
and<br>
<br>
Comprehensive park plans, ranging from general conceptual plans, <br>
through overall Master Plans, to preliminary designs and detailed <br>
site plans for facility development.<br>

                            Over the years, Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have been involved in <br>
the full range of tourism and recreation planning, which may be <br>
as general as broad provincial strategies, or as specific as <br>
individual site development proposals and project-specific <br>
business plans.  This type of planning is based upon the need to <br>
understand existing and expected tourism and recreation patterns, <br>
trends and development expectations, in association with a <br>
comprehensive examination of the natural and cultural resource <br>
base, existing land use patterns, development opportunities and <br>
constraints, and government policies and programs.<br>
<br>
The firm provides the following professional services in the <br>
field of tourism and recreation planning:<br>
<br>
Provincial, regional and/or sectoral tourism strategies;<br>
<br>
Tourism and recreation theme studies and Master Plans;<br>
<br>
Tourism and recreation corridor studies; and<br>
<br>
Site development plans, feasibility assessments and business <br>
plans for such facilities as resort complexes, tourism nodes and <br>
destination areas, campgrounds and visitor centres.<br>

                            Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have extensive experience in providing <br>
First Nations across northwestern Ontario, Manitoba and <br>
Saskatchewan with a broad range of consulting services.  In <br>
Saskatchewan, our First Nations clients have been numerous and <br>
the work we have undertaken for them has been of a variety of <br>
types.  In addition to numerous site planning and landscape <br>
design projects for new Reserve schools across the province, <br>
commissions have included comprehensive community plans, land use <br>
and capital plans and land selection studies under the Treaty <br>
Land Entitlement program.<br>

                            Interpretive planning provides the means by which people can more <br>
fully appreciate the cultural and natural values of their living <br>
environment.  Crosby Hanna &amp; Associates have long recognized the <br>
importance of these values, and have completed a number of <br>
special studies which relate to the interpretation of significant <br>
natural and cultural resources.<br>
<br>
Studies such as these commonly include the following:<br>
<br>
Establishment of management policies and strategies providing for <br>
protection of interpretive resources while, at the same time, <br>
providing opportunities for interpretation; and<br>
<br>
Planning of interpretive systems, including such facilities and <br>
elements as trails, signage, visitor reception areas and <br>
associated recreation facilities.<br>
