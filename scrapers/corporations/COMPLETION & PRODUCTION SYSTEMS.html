                            Alpine Manufactures a complete line of Underbalanced Drilling <br>
Recovery Systems and Surface / Downhole Flow Control Systems <br>
including the Techcorp RPM System 1500, 3000 &amp; 5000 models <br>
Rotating Blow Out Preventers, Wireline Retrievable Drill Pipe <br>
Float Valves and the Techcorp Underbalanced Drilling Deployment <br>
Valve (UBD Valve). Alpine 1 Piece Underbalanced Drilling Combo <br>
Drill Packs are the most compact underbalanced drilling systems <br>
available. These modular systems package the Transfer Pump, <br>
Sparging Pump, Solids Pump, Multi sided Choke Manifold and the <br>
Dual Samplers into a single skid mounted package. These units <br>
are compatible with any of the Alpine Combo P-Tanks and provide <br>
the benefit of expedited rig-up and reduced transportation <br>
requirements. Alpine 2 Piece Underbalanced Drilling Drill Packs <br>
offer the operator all the same systems as the 1 Piece Combo <br>
Packs, however the Pump system and Choke manifold / Sampling  <br>
systems are separated into two separate skid systems. This <br>
allows for sizing of the choke manifold system to the specific <br>
requirements of the operation. These systems also allow an <br>
extended operator work space. Alpine 3 Piece, Ultra High Volume, <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Drill Packs utilize a dual Separator / P-<br>
Tank configuration. A large 500 bbl 45 ft x 8 ft p-tank is used <br>
to provided high volume capabilities while a 150 bbl separator <br>
provides all instrumentation and is packaged with the pump <br>
system and sampling system. Alpine Combo P-Tanks have full 3 <br>
Phase Separation capabilities and can be used during both <br>
underbalanced drilling operations or during production testing <br>
operations. These systems can be either skid mounted or trailer <br>
mounted and can be either horizontal or vertical type systems. <br>
Alpine manufactures a variety of  Combo Hydraulic Flare Stack / <br>
Pipe Skids for underbalanced drilling systems, these units are <br>
usually skid mounted with all piping, include auxiliary flare <br>
lines and are equipped with electronic igniters. Alpine OSPACK <br>
Real Time Flow Reporting Software integrates a custom designed  <br>
real time flow reporting system with a 25 channel data <br>
acquisition system. This allows continual monitoring of all <br>
critical functions of the underbalanced drilling operations and <br>
provides real time feed back to the drilling engineer. Constant <br>
production test data is developed while drilling. Alpine <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Lease Office Command Centers, both skid <br>
and trailer mounted, these mobile offices are each equipped with <br>
a Real Time Daniel&#39;s Flow computer and with a 25 channel data <br>
acquisition system feeding Alpine&#39;s custom designed OSDACK and <br>
AMDAR software systems. A full line of high pressure Alpine <br>
Fully Automated 3 Phase Test Separators for both domestic use <br>
and export sales. These systems are fully tailored to meet <br>
customer requirements. Alpine fabricates both gate valve and <br>
plug valve choke manifold systems using third party valves and <br>
chokes. Alpine manufactures both direct and indirect, steam and <br>
gas fired line heaters for production testing. These systems can <br>
be either skid or trailer mounted. AMDAR is Alpine&#39;s custom <br>
designed, Windows based field mode production testing, data <br>
logging and reporting software. This  software package was <br>
developed to allow fast, accurate data reporting during <br>
production tests. The Alpine Fast Separator system is a very <br>
compact high pressure Vortex separation system developed to <br>
meet  the future requirements in International and offshore <br>
underbalanced drilling systems. This unit allows for higher flow <br>
rate production without the need for huge P-Tank separation <br>
systems. Alpine designs and manufactures custom designed early <br>
production systems for export sales. These systems are designed <br>
as modular systems to allow the flexibility of adding modules to <br>
meet field production requirements.<br>

most advanced Coiled Tubing and/or Wireline Retrievable Drill <br>
Pipe Float Valves for use with Directional Drilling Equipment <br>
and Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) applications. Multiple <br>
retrievable float valves run as an integral part of the <br>
directional drilling string offer several advantages not the <br>
least of which is that retrievable floats do not have to be <br>
drilled out should the need arise to Free Point, Back-off, Wash <br>
Over and retrieve the bottom hole assembly. Swift change out of <br>
Wireline retrievable directional tools can be accomplished <br>
without tripping the drilling assembly out of the hole. Alpine <br>
provides a wide range of Electric Wireline / Slickline Products <br>
and Services, from helicopter portable skid units to tandem axle <br>
combination units with multi-service capability.<br>

most advanced Coiled Tubing and/or Wireline Retrievable Drill <br>
Pipe Float Valves for use with Drilling Motors, Directional <br>
Drilling Equipment and Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) <br>
applications. Multiple retrievable float valves run as an <br>
integral part of the directional drilling string offer several <br>
advantages not the least of which is that retrievable floats do <br>
not have to be drilled out should the need arise to Free Point, <br>
Back-off, Wash Over and retrieve the bottom hole assembly. Swift <br>
change out of Wireline retrievable directional tools can be <br>
accomplished without tripping the drilling assembly out of the <br>
hole. Alpine provides a wide range of Electric Wireline / <br>
Slickline Products and Services, from helicopter portable skid <br>
units to tandem axle combination units with multi-service <br>
capability.<br>

Pipe Float valves for use with Horizontal Drilling Services, <br>
Drilling Motors, Directional Drilling Equipment and <br>
Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) applications. Multiple retrievable <br>
float valves run as an integral part of the directional drilling <br>
string offer several advantages not the least of which is that <br>
retrievable floats do not have to be drilled out should the need <br>
arise to commence Fishing Operations, Free Point, Back-off, Wash <br>
Over and retrieve the bottom hole assembly. Swift change out of <br>
Wireline retrievable directional tools can be accomplished <br>
without tripping the drilling assembly out of the hole. Alpine <br>
provides a wide range of Electric Wireline / Slickline Products <br>
and Services, from Wireline BOPs and flow control equipment, <br>
helicopter portable skid units to tandem axle combination units <br>
with multi-service capability . One of the most anticipated Flow <br>
Control products that Alpine has been developing, the <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Deployment Valve ( UBD Valve TM ), is now <br>
in limited production. Run as an integral part of the casing <br>
program, the UBD Valve TM  allows full bore passage for the <br>

tank is used to provide high volume capabilities while a 150 bbl <br>
separator provides all instrumentation and is packaged with the <br>
pump system and sampling system. Alpine Combo P-Tanks have full <br>
3 Phase Separation capabilities and can be used during EARLY <br>
PRODUCTION,  underbalanced drilling operations or during <br>
production testing operations. These systems are skid mounted <br>
for offshore use and can be either horizontal or vertical type <br>
systems. Alpine OSPACK Real Time Flow Reporting Software <br>
integrates a custom designed  real time flow reporting system <br>
with a 25 channel data acquisition system. This allows continual <br>
monitoring of all critical functions of the operations and <br>
provides real time feed back to the desired location. Marketed <br>

High Volume, Fracturing Flowback and Underbalanced Drilling <br>
Drill Packs utilize a dual Separator / P-Tank configuration. A <br>
large 500 bbl 45 ft x 8 ft p-tank is used to provide high volume <br>
capabilities while a 150 bbl separator provides all <br>
instrumentation and is packaged with the pump system and <br>
sampling system. Alpine Combo P-Tanks have full 3 Phase <br>
Separation capabilities and can be used during Fracturing <br>
Flowbacks, Underbalanced drilling operations or during <br>
production testing operations. These systems can be either skid <br>
mounted or trailer mounted and can be either horizontal or <br>
vertical type systems. Alpine manufactures a variety of  Combo <br>
Hydraulic Flare Stack / Pipe Skids for Underbalanced Drilling <br>
and Fracturing Flowback systems, these units are usually skid <br>
mounted with all piping, include auxiliary flare lines and are <br>
equipped with electronic igniters. Alpine OSPACK Real Time Flow <br>
Reporting Software integrates a custom designed  real time flow <br>
reporting system with a 25 channel data acquisition system. This <br>
allows continual monitoring of all critical functions of the <br>
operations and provides real time feed back to the engineer.<br>

retrievable floats do not have to be drilled out should the need <br>
arise to commence Fishing Operations, Free Point, Back-off, Wash <br>
Over and retrieve the bottom hole assembly. Swift change out of <br>
Wireline retrievable directional tools can be accomplished <br>
without tripping the drilling assembly out of the hole. Alpine <br>
provides a wide range of Electric Wireline / Slickline Products <br>
and Services, from Wireline BOPs and flow control equipment, <br>
helicopter portable skid units to tandem axle combination units <br>
with multi-service capability . One of the most anticipated Flow <br>
Control products that Alpine has been developing, the <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Deployment Valve ( UBD Valve TM ), is now <br>
in limited production. Run as an integral part of the casing <br>
program, the UBD Valve TM  allows full bore passage for the <br>
drill bit, allows the drill string to be tripped without the use <br>
of a snubbing unit or the need to kill the well when tripping, <br>
and offers significant savings and personnel safety. The most <br>
advanced Rotating Blow Out Preventer Systems available today, <br>
the Techcorp RPM System 1500, 3000 &amp; 5000, are made in Canada by <br>

                            Alpine manufactures Pressure Vessels and equipment and provides <br>
services for Well frac and stimulation recovery, (FRACTURING <br>
FLOWBACKS), absolute open flow tests A.O.F., production tests, <br>
in-line production tests, wellbore clean-ups, before and after <br>
workovers and completions and Underbalanced Drilling. Sweet and <br>

Alpine 3 Piece, Ultra High Volume, Fracturing Flowback and <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Drill Packs utilize a dual Separator / P-<br>
Tank configuration. A large 500 bbl 45 ft x 8 ft p-tank is used <br>
to provide high volume capabilities while a 150 bbl separator <br>
provides all instrumentation and is packaged with the pump <br>
system and sampling system. Alpine Combo P-Tanks have full 3 <br>
Phase Separation capabilities and can be used during both <br>
underbalanced drilling operations or during production testing <br>
operations. These systems can be either skid mounted or trailer <br>
mounted and can be either horizontal or vertical type systems. <br>
Alpine manufactures a variety of  Combo Hydraulic Flare Stack / <br>
Pipe Skids for Underbalanced Drilling and Fracturing Flowback <br>
systems, these units are usually skid mounted with all piping, <br>
include auxiliary flare lines and are equipped with electronic <br>
igniters. Alpine OSPACK Real Time Flow Reporting Software <br>
integrates a custom designed  real time flow reporting system <br>
with a 25 channel data acquisition system. This allows continual <br>
monitoring of all critical functions of the operations and <br>
provides real time feed back to the engineer.<br>

            One of the most anticipated products that Alpine has been <br>
developing, the Underbalanced Drilling Deployment Valve ( UBD <br>
Valve TM ), is now in limited production. Run as an integral <br>
part of the casing program, the UBD Valve TM  allows full bore <br>
passage for the drill bit, allows the drill string to be tripped <br>
without the use of a snubbing unit or the need to kill the well <br>
when tripping, and offers significant savings and personnel <br>
safety. Interest in this product has been extremely high from a <br>
number of areas in the world, even prior to the commencement of <br>
marketing. <br>
<br>
Alpine&#39;s acquisition of Techcorp Industries Inc. brought the <br>
most advanced Rotating Blow Out Preventer Systems available <br>
today (Techcorp RPM System 1500, 3000 &amp; 5000)and the significant <br>
technological product advancements in the Techcorp Product <br>
lines. These include the first Wireline Retrievable Drill Pipe <br>
Float Valves for use with Directional Drilling Equipment and <br>
Underbalanced Drilling (UBD)applications, External Casing <br>
Packers and the worlds smallest and lightest, Helicopter <br>
transportable Mini Electronic Gauge Carrier System.<br>
<br>
Alpine is now the world leader in Electromagnetic Telemetry <br>
Subsurface Data Transmission or &quot;Real Time&quot; during Drill Stem <br>
Testing (DST) operations, with over 5000 successful &quot;Real Time&quot; <br>
tests completed. The latest generation Telemetry System is <br>
designed for use both in Cased Hole Production Testing <br>
Operations and the original Open Hole DST Operations.<br>

                            Alpine Manufactures a complete line of Underbalanced Drilling <br>
Recovery Systems and Surface / Downhole Flow Control Systems <br>
including the Techcorp RPM System 1500, 3000 &amp; 5000 models <br>
Rotating Blow Out Preventers, Wireline Retrievable Drill Pipe <br>
Float Valves and the Techcorp Underbalanced Drilling Deployment <br>
Valve (UBD Valve). Alpine 1 Piece Underbalanced Drilling Combo <br>
Drill Packs are the most compact underbalanced drilling systems <br>
available. These modular systems package the Transfer Pump, <br>
Sparging Pump, Solids Pump, Multi sided Choke Manifold and the <br>
Dual Samplers into a single skid mounted package. These units <br>
are compatible with any of the Alpine Combo P-Tanks and provide <br>
the benefit of expedited rig-up and reduced transportation <br>
requirements. Alpine 2 Piece Underbalanced Drilling Drill Packs <br>
offer the operator all the same systems as the 1 Piece Combo <br>
Packs, however the Pump system and Choke manifold / Sampling  <br>
systems are separated into two separate skid systems. This <br>
allows for sizing of the choke manifold system to the specific <br>
requirements of the operation. These systems also allow an <br>
extended operator work space. Alpine 3 Piece, Ultra High Volume, <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Drill Packs utilize a dual Separator / P-<br>
Tank configuration. A large 500 bbl 45 ft x 8 ft p-tank is used <br>
to provided high volume capabilities while a 150 bbl separator <br>
provides all instrumentation and is packaged with the pump <br>
system and sampling system. Alpine Combo P-Tanks have full 3 <br>
Phase Separation capabilities and can be used during both <br>
underbalanced drilling operations or during production testing <br>
operations. These systems can be either skid mounted or trailer <br>
mounted and can be either horizontal or vertical type systems. <br>
Alpine manufactures a variety of  Combo Hydraulic Flare Stack / <br>
Pipe Skids for underbalanced drilling systems, these units are <br>
usually skid mounted with all piping, include auxiliary flare <br>
lines and are equipped with electronic igniters. Alpine OSPACK <br>
Real Time Flow Reporting Software integrates a custom designed  <br>
real time flow reporting system with a 25 channel data <br>
acquisition system. This allows continual monitoring of all <br>
critical functions of the underbalanced drilling operations and <br>
provides real time feed back to the drilling engineer. Constant <br>
production test data is developed while drilling. Alpine <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Lease Office Command Centers, both skid <br>
and trailer mounted, these mobile offices are each equipped with <br>
a Real Time Daniel&#39;s Flow computer and with a 25 channel data <br>
acquisition system feeding Alpine&#39;s custom designed OSDACK and <br>
AMDAR software systems. A full line of high pressure Alpine <br>
Fully Automated 3 Phase Test Separators for both domestic use <br>
and export sales. These systems are fully tailored to meet <br>
customer requirements. Alpine fabricates both gate valve and <br>
plug valve choke manifold systems using third party valves and <br>
chokes. Alpine manufactures both direct and indirect, steam and <br>
gas fired line heaters for production testing. These systems can <br>
be either skid or trailer mounted. AMDAR is Alpine&#39;s custom <br>
designed, Windows based field mode production testing, data <br>
logging and reporting software. This  software package was <br>
developed to allow fast, accurate data reporting during <br>
production tests. The Alpine Fast Separator system is a very <br>
compact high pressure Vortex separation system developed to <br>
meet  the future requirements in International and offshore <br>
underbalanced drilling systems. This unit allows for higher flow <br>
rate production without the need for huge P-Tank separation <br>
systems. Alpine designs and manufactures custom designed early <br>
production systems for export sales. These systems are designed <br>
as modular systems to allow the flexibility of adding modules to <br>

                            Alpine&#39;s acquisition of Techcorp Industries Inc. brought the <br>
most advanced Coiled Tubing and/or Wireline Retrievable Drill <br>
Pipe Float Valves for use with Drilling Motors, Directional <br>
Drilling Equipment and Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) <br>
applications. Multiple retrievable float valves run as an <br>
integral part of the directional drilling string offer several <br>
advantages not the least of which is that retrievable floats do <br>
not have to be drilled out should the need arise to commence <br>
Fishing Operations, Free Point, Back-off, Wash Over and retrieve <br>
the bottom hole assembly. Swift change out of Wireline <br>
retrievable directional tools can be accomplished without <br>
tripping the drilling assembly out of the hole. Alpine provides <br>
a wide range of Electric Wireline / Slickline Products and <br>
Services, from helicopter portable skid units to tandem axle <br>
combination units with multi-service capability including <br>
selective fire perforating, tubing punch services, Back-off <br>
services, Tubing &amp; Casing jet cutters and Tubing &amp; Drill pipe <br>
chemical cutters. One of the most anticipated products that <br>
Alpine has been developing, the Underbalanced Drilling <br>
Deployment Valve ( UBD Valve TM ), is now in limited production. <br>
Run as an integral part of the casing program, the UBD Valve TM  <br>
allows full bore passage for the drill bit, allows the drill <br>
string to be tripped without the use of a snubbing unit or the <br>
need to kill the well when tripping, and offers significant <br>
savings and personnel safety.<br>

Pipe Float valves for use with Horizontal Drilling Services, <br>
Drilling Motors, Directional Drilling Equipment and <br>
Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) applications. Multiple retrievable <br>
float valves run as an integral part of the directional drilling <br>
string offer several advantages not the least of which is that <br>
retrievable floats do not have to be drilled out should the need <br>
arise to commence Fishing Operations, Free Point, Back-off, Wash <br>
Over and retrieve the bottom hole assembly. Swift change out of <br>
Wireline retrievable directional tools can be accomplished <br>
without tripping the drilling assembly out of the hole. Alpine <br>
provides a wide range of Electric Wireline / Slickline Products <br>
and Services, from Wireline BOPs and flow control equipment, <br>
helicopter portable skid units to tandem axle combination units <br>
with multi-service capability . One of the most anticipated Flow <br>
Control products that Alpine has been developing, the <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Deployment Valve ( UBD Valve TM ), is now <br>
in limited production. Run as an integral part of the casing <br>
program, the UBD Valve TM  allows full bore passage for the <br>
drill bit, allows the drill string to be tripped without the use <br>
of a snubbing unit or the need to kill the well when tripping, <br>
and offers significant savings and personnel safety. The most <br>
advanced Rotating Blow Out Preventer Systems available today, <br>
the Techcorp RPM System 1500, 3000 &amp; 5000, are made in Canada by <br>

provides a wide range of Electric Wireline / Slickline Products <br>
and Services, from Wireline BOPs and flow control equipment, <br>
helicopter portable skid units to tandem axle combination units <br>
with multi-service capability . One of the most anticipated Flow <br>
Control products that Alpine has been developing, the <br>
Underbalanced Drilling Deployment Valve ( UBD Valve TM ), is now <br>
in limited production. Run as an integral part of the casing <br>
program, the UBD Valve TM  allows full bore passage for the <br>
drill bit, allows the drill string to be tripped without the use <br>
of a snubbing unit or the need to kill the well when tripping, <br>
and offers significant savings and personnel safety. The most <br>
advanced Rotating Blow Out Preventer Systems available today, <br>
the Techcorp RPM System 1500, 3000 &amp; 5000, are made in Canada by <br>
Alpine Oil Services Corporation.<br>

            One of the most anticipated products that Alpine has been <br>
developing, the Underbalanced Drilling Deployment Valve ( UBD <br>
Valve TM ), is now in limited production. Run as an integral <br>
part of the casing program, the UBD Valve TM  allows full bore <br>
passage for the drill bit, allows the drill string to be tripped <br>
without the use of a snubbing unit or the need to kill the well <br>
when tripping, and offers significant savings and personnel <br>
safety. Interest in this product has been extremely high from a <br>
number of areas in the world, even prior to the commencement of <br>
marketing. <br>
<br>
Alpine&#39;s acquisition of Techcorp Industries Inc. brought the <br>
most advanced Rotating Blow Out Preventer Systems available <br>
today (Techcorp RPM System 1500, 3000 &amp; 5000)and the significant <br>
technological product advancements in the Techcorp Product <br>
lines. These include the first Wireline Retrievable Drill Pipe <br>
Float Valves for use with Directional Drilling Equipment and <br>
Underbalanced Drilling (UBD)applications, External Casing <br>
