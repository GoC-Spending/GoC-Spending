Galaxy’s new service plans and terminals deliver dedicated upload speeds, burstable download rates up to 50Mbps tied to a guaranteed CIR with an emphasis on business application performance.  Galaxy has placed a large emphasis on application performance when designing and building this new platform/service.  Applications such as IPSEC VPN clients, Microsoft LYNC/Skype for Business, SharePoint, SAP, Citrix as well as VoIP trunks and video conference feeds; to name a few simply work “out of the box”.  The terminal modems are capable of full VLAN trunking over the Satellite link; additionally they can serve as transparent L2 bridges but still capable of applying QoS/COS and shapers to the L2 trunks.  This feature allow for seamless integration of a customer private network switching/routing rule set to integrate into Galaxy’s satellite modem.  The hardware used on this service is capable of pushing 250,000 packets for second; clients will max out their 50Mbps x 6Mbps service before their ever able to hit their maximum session count. <br>

Galaxy’s new service plans and terminals deliver dedicated upload speeds, burstable download rates up to 50Mbps tied to a guaranteed CIR with an emphasis on business application performance.  Galaxy has placed a large emphasis on application performance when designing and building this new platform/service.  Applications such as IPSEC VPN clients, Microsoft LYNC/Skype for Business, SharePoint, SAP, Citrix as well as VoIP trunks and video conference feeds; to name a few simply work “out of the box”.  The terminal modems are capable of full VLAN trunking over the Satellite link; additionally they can serve as transparent L2 bridges but still capable of applying QoS/COS and shapers to the L2 trunks.  This feature allow for seamless integration of a customer private network switching/routing rule set to integrate into Galaxy’s satellite modem.  The hardware used on this service is capable of pushing 250,000 packets for second; clients will max out their 50Mbps x 6Mbps service before their ever able to hit their maximum session count. <br>
  <br>
Galaxy’s MCPC network has been deployed, tested and proven on high profile sites across Canada and is ready to power your next major remote internet deployment! <br>
