              </h4>
          
              I recently completed a Master of Arts in Leadership and Training from Royal Roads University (RRU). Karen Crosby of Editarians encouraged and motivated me throughout the major project (thesis) phase of the program. <br>
<br>
Editarians went beyond the call of duty, returning drafts in a timely manner and often working weekends and nights to assist me with my deliverables. Karen brought clarity and order to my writing. I produced the meat, and she edited and organized it in a manner that enriched my message. This exceptional service allowed my thesis to be approved on the first submission. <br>
<br>
Karen taught me useful lessons about writing and demonstrated exemplary ethical leadership. She&#39;s a great leader, and I would recommend her company, Editarians , to anyone!!! <br>

Editarians was instrumental in completing a thesis that I could be very proud of. Erin&#39;s work was professional, timely, and accurate. It was wonderful to be able to focus on the content and to know that a professional copy editor was taking care of the formatting of the document. Erin provided sound advice and direction which kept me on track and was always willing to answer any questions I had throughout the editing process. Thank you so much for a job well done!<br>

I used Editarians for a master level course. Using Editarians made the difference between a good mark and a great mark in my class. This was a great investment for me and my career in academia: receiving this mark allowed me to apply for a masters program with an improved GPA. Editarians also allowed me to rest assured that the little details were taken care of. It was a great partnership; they really respect and compliment your own personal writing style within their editing. I would definitely use them in the future and recommend them to other academic colleagues.<br>

Karen (and Erin) were a pleasure to work with. I had a very quick turnaround time to meet, and despite some circumstances that were beyond anyone&#39;s control, they made superhuman efforts to meet a vitally important deadline. They were in frequent contact and I always had every confidence that the product would be done not only on time, but also to the highest quality. As hard as it is to believe, I actually enjoyed having my work edited by them. I would highly recommend their services to anyone in need of an editor.<br>

Editarians was a lifesaver! Their editors helped me to refine my masters thesis, and they accomplished this from across the continent! We set up a schedule with deliverables and regularly checked in through e-mail. They saved me an incredible amount of time and provided loads of professional support at a reasonable price. I highly recommend their services to anyone and everyone who creates any documents, but especially professional and large-scale projects that have a lot riding on them. Thank you so much, Editarians, for supporting me through my second masters thesis!!<br>

My name is Richard Eaton and recently I successfully completed the requirements for a Masters Degree in Leadership from Royal Roads University. A significant part of the graduation requirements involves the completion of a major project papera thesis. Royal Roads demands a very high standard of writing, and is meticulous about learner adherence to the American Psychological Associations (APA) writing style standards. As a busy professional with a large business and growing family, I had very little time to spare and could not afford to go through any lengthy rework processes if I wanted to graduate on time. This need for first time approval by the Royal Roads Ethics Committee left me with little margin for error, and I needed to find a high quality editor who could respond to my needs quickly and efficiently.<br>
<br>
On the advice of Royal Roads faculty member David Reagan, I retained the services of Karen and Erin with Editarians. I found Karen and Erin to be an excellent editing team who, at all times, provided me with high quality, timely advice regarding APA style and writing quality. Because I was forced to do much of my writing on weekends and evenings, I was particularly impressed by Karen&#39;s willingness and ability to respond at any time of the day or night to the latest draft of my paper, resulting in the completion of my paper well ahead of schedule. I highly valued Karen&#39;s insights and advice, and seldom found the need to second guess any input she had for me regarding my paper. I also found her friendly and very encouraging, which was of critical importance in helping me to stay motivated throughout a very challenging personal learning experience, complicated by ample opportunities for self-doubt. Even more amazing is the fact that she accomplished all this without even having an opportunity to meet with me face-to-face at any time during my major project. In many ways, Karen helped to provide the leadership I needed to complete a challenging leadership focused project, and was consequently a good role model for me.<br>
<br>
I have no hesitation in recommending Editarians to any other learner seeking a high quality editor who is also an excellent leader.<br>

&quot;The editorial services offered by Karen Crosby provide a writer with confidence. Her attention to detail ensures you will meet the technical and academic standards required. She clearly is well versed with formatting, the APA style guide, and giving that final polish, and her flexible working process supports any shortcomings you may have as a writer. Her devotion to editing allowed me the time to focus on content and research while having the satisfaction that my wordsmithing would morph into a professional and accepted academic document; the peace of mind was priceless. Plus, she had gooder English than me.&quot;<br>

&quot;I had the pleasure of collaborating with Karen on a substantial report required for my master&#39;s degree. I was thoroughly pleased with Karens work and her overall attitude towards my project, timelines, and anxieties. Karen was exceptionally diligent in her attention to details, was responsive to my needs and deadlines, and was extremely thorough in consistently applying the prescribed writing standards to which the report needed to adhere. I would easily work again with Karen and would highly recommend her to anyone who is seeking a conscientious, highly organized, efficient, detail-oriented editor, who is also a great person and someone to whom you can easily entrust your important written works.&quot;<br>

&quot;Karen took the clay I produced and shaped it into a clearly defined, succinct work that delivers its message in a fashion that everyone can understand. Working from a distance, with an unfamiliar topic, and with a wordy document, Karen identified the key words, thoughts, and critical concepts, and shaped them into a master&#39;s thesis. She demonstrated a talent for explicating the heart of my work. I am indebted to her.&quot;<br>

&quot;Karen&#39;s editing skills were absolutely superb! After several months of being consumed with researching, data gathering, and writing, I had become very protective of my work. Karen&#39;s respectful, objective, and timely feedback assisted me in putting the final touches on a thesis that I was proud to submit as a requirement for my master&#39;s degree. Thank you, Karen!&quot;<br>

&quot;Karen Crosby is a professional in every sense of the word. She not only has a great knowledge of the written language, but also an authentic desire to coach her clients to success. Karens clear, concise knowledge and attention to detail is second only to her approachability and openness. She always strives for a quick turn-around time on assignments, but never at risk of compromising the quality of the end product. It was an absolute pleasure to work with her and I would highly recommend her to anyone.&quot;<br>

&quot;The editing services offered by Karen Crosby are phenomenal. She is both professional and thorough. Her insights have offered me a very rich learning experience. Since using her services and receiving her brilliant writing tips, my grammar use has improved and my writing style has become more succinct. I greatly appreciate her kind guidance and strong mastery of the English language. It has truly been a pleasure to work with her. I would strongly recommend the use of her editing services.&quot;<br>

&quot;Calling upon Karens expertise as editor of my masters thesis proved to be a very wise choice. Highly professional and expedient, I found Karens services alleviated much of the stress that comes from writing a thesis while working full-time. As a writer, I felt I could concentrate on the content without worrying so much about grammar, APA formatting, etc. I had complete confidence in Karens ability to guide me from start to finish. Working with an editor of Karens calibre was truly a wonderful experience. It is with great pleasure that I recommend her services to anyone who would like to enhance their writing style, and ensure that their work meets all professional writing standards.&quot;<br>

&quot;I had the privilege of working with Karen on my master&#39;s thesis. Her editing skills were right on the money, and she did an expert job in adapting to my learning and working styles. She was professional, dependable, and was able to address my needs as the project evolved. She had that unique blend of intellectual and emotional intelligence, and contributed in a significant way to the success of my paper!&quot; <br>

&quot;I found Karen&#39;s expertise invaluable for the successful completion of a quality thesis. I am not a details person, and found myself increasingly appreciative of Karen&#39;s skills and abilities as an editor while we worked together in completing the project. Not only did she correct all the &#39;picky little errors&#39; (and the big ones, too), but made suggestions to improve the overall calibre of the paper. I was thrilled with the final product and highly recommend Karen&#39;s editorial services to others who wish to produce a paper they would be proud to share with others.&quot; <br>

I was very pleased with the quality of service I received and the speed at which you were able to review my thesis chapters and provide recommendations. Your assistance made the process much easier and I would certainly use your services again if a need were to arise. Thanks! <br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              I recently completed a Master of Arts in Leadership and Training from Royal Roads University (RRU). Karen Crosby of Editarians encouraged and motivated me throughout the major project (thesis) phase of the program. <br>
<br>
Editarians went beyond the call of duty, returning drafts in a timely manner and often working weekends and nights to assist me with my deliverables. Karen brought clarity and order to my writing. I produced the meat, and she edited and organized it in a manner that enriched my message. This exceptional service allowed my thesis to be approved on the first submission. <br>
<br>
Karen taught me useful lessons about writing and demonstrated exemplary ethical leadership. She&#39;s a great leader, and I would recommend her company, Editarians , to anyone!!! <br>

Editarians was instrumental in completing a thesis that I could be very proud of. Erin&#39;s work was professional, timely, and accurate. It was wonderful to be able to focus on the content and to know that a professional copy editor was taking care of the formatting of the document. Erin provided sound advice and direction which kept me on track and was always willing to answer any questions I had throughout the editing process. Thank you so much for a job well done!<br>

I used Editarians for a master level course. Using Editarians made the difference between a good mark and a great mark in my class. This was a great investment for me and my career in academia: receiving this mark allowed me to apply for a masters program with an improved GPA. Editarians also allowed me to rest assured that the little details were taken care of. It was a great partnership; they really respect and compliment your own personal writing style within their editing. I would definitely use them in the future and recommend them to other academic colleagues.<br>

Karen (and Erin) were a pleasure to work with. I had a very quick turnaround time to meet, and despite some circumstances that were beyond anyone&#39;s control, they made superhuman efforts to meet a vitally important deadline. They were in frequent contact and I always had every confidence that the product would be done not only on time, but also to the highest quality. As hard as it is to believe, I actually enjoyed having my work edited by them. I would highly recommend their services to anyone in need of an editor.<br>

Editarians was a lifesaver! Their editors helped me to refine my masters thesis, and they accomplished this from across the continent! We set up a schedule with deliverables and regularly checked in through e-mail. They saved me an incredible amount of time and provided loads of professional support at a reasonable price. I highly recommend their services to anyone and everyone who creates any documents, but especially professional and large-scale projects that have a lot riding on them. Thank you so much, Editarians, for supporting me through my second masters thesis!!<br>

My name is Richard Eaton and recently I successfully completed the requirements for a Masters Degree in Leadership from Royal Roads University. A significant part of the graduation requirements involves the completion of a major project papera thesis. Royal Roads demands a very high standard of writing, and is meticulous about learner adherence to the American Psychological Associations (APA) writing style standards. As a busy professional with a large business and growing family, I had very little time to spare and could not afford to go through any lengthy rework processes if I wanted to graduate on time. This need for first time approval by the Royal Roads Ethics Committee left me with little margin for error, and I needed to find a high quality editor who could respond to my needs quickly and efficiently.<br>
<br>
On the advice of Royal Roads faculty member David Reagan, I retained the services of Karen and Erin with Editarians. I found Karen and Erin to be an excellent editing team who, at all times, provided me with high quality, timely advice regarding APA style and writing quality. Because I was forced to do much of my writing on weekends and evenings, I was particularly impressed by Karen&#39;s willingness and ability to respond at any time of the day or night to the latest draft of my paper, resulting in the completion of my paper well ahead of schedule. I highly valued Karen&#39;s insights and advice, and seldom found the need to second guess any input she had for me regarding my paper. I also found her friendly and very encouraging, which was of critical importance in helping me to stay motivated throughout a very challenging personal learning experience, complicated by ample opportunities for self-doubt. Even more amazing is the fact that she accomplished all this without even having an opportunity to meet with me face-to-face at any time during my major project. In many ways, Karen helped to provide the leadership I needed to complete a challenging leadership focused project, and was consequently a good role model for me.<br>
<br>
I have no hesitation in recommending Editarians to any other learner seeking a high quality editor who is also an excellent leader.<br>

&quot;The editorial services offered by Karen Crosby provide a writer with confidence. Her attention to detail ensures you will meet the technical and academic standards required. She clearly is well versed with formatting, the APA style guide, and giving that final polish, and her flexible working process supports any shortcomings you may have as a writer. Her devotion to editing allowed me the time to focus on content and research while having the satisfaction that my wordsmithing would morph into a professional and accepted academic document; the peace of mind was priceless. Plus, she had gooder English than me.&quot;<br>

I was thoroughly pleased with Karens work and her overall attitude towards my project, timelines, and anxieties. Karen was exceptionally diligent in her attention to details, was responsive to my needs and deadlines, and was extremely thorough in consistently applying the prescribed writing standards to which the report needed to adhere. I would easily work again with Karen and would highly recommend her to anyone who is seeking a conscientious, highly organized, efficient, detail-oriented editor, who is also a great person and someone to whom you can easily entrust your important written works.&quot;<br>

&quot;Karen took the clay I produced and shaped it into a clearly defined, succinct work that delivers its message in a fashion that everyone can understand. Working from a distance, with an unfamiliar topic, and with a wordy document, Karen identified the key words, thoughts, and critical concepts, and shaped them into a master&#39;s thesis. She demonstrated a talent for explicating the heart of my work. I am indebted to her.&quot;<br>

Thank you, Karen!&quot;<br>

&quot;I found Karen&#39;s expertise invaluable for the successful completion of a quality thesis. I am not a details person, and found myself increasingly appreciative of Karen&#39;s skills and abilities as an editor while we worked together in completing the project. Not only did she correct all the &#39;picky little errors&#39; (and the big ones, too), but made suggestions to improve the overall calibre of the paper. I was thrilled with the final product and highly recommend Karen&#39;s editorial services to others who wish to produce a paper they would be proud to share with others.&quot; <br>
