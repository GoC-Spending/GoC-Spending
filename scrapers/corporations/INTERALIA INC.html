                            The XMU+ fills the void between simple passive announcers and expensive voicemail or IVR systems. It is a cost effective announcement, call processing and music/message-on-hold system with state-of-the-art design, and flexible configuration options that enables managers to deliver the same functionality as more elaborate systems, but at a fraction of the cost. The Interalia XMU+ is compatible with all major telephone systems, and very easy to install and operate. <br>
<br>
The XMU+ is Interalias next generation advanced announcement, call processing and music or messaging-on-hold system. It is an ideal solution for any industry needing: auto attendant, ACD announcements, music/messaging-on-hold, interactive audiotex, call processing and basic IVR functionality. Our customers find that when they move applications to the XMU+ from more expensive IVR and voicemail systems, they save money while delivering the same functionality. <br>
<br>
The XMU+ allows companies to provide callers with a variety of messages without requiring a dedicated port for each message, and it is easy to change an announcement message so callers only receive the most up-to-date information. <br>
<br>
The XMU+:<br>
1. Allows callers to choose extensions (dial-by-name).<br>
2. Answers and transfers calls (call processing).<br>
3. Prompts callers and routes calls (auto attendant).<br>
4. Notifies callers when agents are unavailable (ACD Announcements).<br>
5. Prompts Callers to have information available.<br>
6. Entertains callers with Music/Messaging-On-Hold.<br>
7. Answers calls after closing (after-hour attendant).<br>
8. Provides answers to questions (interactive audiotex).<br>
9. Delivers information 24 hours-a-day (information lines).<br>
10. Provides hotel wake-up functionality.<br>
11. Delivers weather and emergency broadcasts.<br>
12. Broadcasts disaster and emergency messages.<br>
<br>
<br>
The XMU+ is an excellent solution for:<br>
- Call processing <br>
- Auto Attendant <br>
- ACD announcements <br>
- Music/Messaging-on-hold <br>
- After-Hour Attendant <br>
- Interactive Audiotex <br>
- Information Lines <br>
- Hotel Wake-up <br>
- Weather and Emergency Broadcasts <br>
- Disaster and Emergency Messages<br>
<br>
Call Processing:<br>
The XMU+ helps companies transfer calls when operators are not available. It front-ends main telephone lines prompting callers for the location they want to be directed to, then transferring those callers to the appropriate location. The XMU+ can direct callers to: ACD queues, IVR ports, departments, voicemail or informational messages. It is a great solution to reduce caller frustration, offload IVR or voicemail and process high volumes of calls. <br>
<br>
Auto Attendant:<br>
The XMU+ is an excellent solution for any business that cant justify expensive call handling solutions or additional operators. It delivers efficient and affordable automated attendant functionality to outside callers and internal staff. The XMU+ prompts callers for the extension they want, then quickly routes the call to that extension or to the requested audiotex information. If you need auto attendant functionality, the XMU+ is a great way to provide 24-hour access to extensions and information.<br>
<br>
ACD Announcements:<br>
Even with voicemails popularity callers still have the need to talk to a live agent. When agents are not available and callers have to be put on-hold, the XMU+ can be used to notify callers of a delay. It can play a variety of interesting ACD announcements until an agent is available to take their call. These messages may provide product information, promote services or educate callers about the company. The XMU+ can also be used to prompt callers to have information available before talking to a live agent (credit card numbers, account information, etc.) Using the XMU+ for ACD announcements helps prepare the caller, speeds up call processing and occupies the caller while they wait on-hold.<br>
<br>
Music/Messaging-On-Hold:<br>
The XMU+ can occupy callers while they wait on-hold by playing a variety of music and messages. When callers are entertained and informed while waiting on-hold, time goes by faster and they experience less frustration.<br>
<br>
After-Hour Attendant:<br>
When offices or stores close the XMU+ continues to answer calls and transfer callers to extensions, information, or even other offices in different parts of the world.  This  means  callers  can  still  speak  to  a  representative even after the office has closed for the day.<br>
<br>
Interactive Audiotex:<br>
The XMU+ is a great solution for interactive audiotex applications  because  it  can  provide  answers  to  frequently asked questions such as: store hours, locations, services and special promotions. Interactive audiotex has many benefits: callers receive the answers they need without waiting on-hold, calls are processed faster, and existing staff have more time to help customers that require personal assistance.<br>
<br>
Information Lines:<br>
The XMU+ is a great way to provide general information to the public or staff. Many companies use it to deliver: student information lines, 24-hour health information, concert and sporting event details, or human resource information. Any time of the day, callers are able to quickly get the information they need without waiting on-hold to talk to an agent.<br>
<br>
Hotel Wake-Up:<br>
The Interalia XMU+ easily interfaces with hotel telephone systems to play announcements for guest wake-up. Hotels can inform guests about dining room specials, tours, weather forecasts, and hotel facilities.<br>
<br>
Weather and Emergency Broadcasts:<br>
Government departments use Interalia products to broadcast weather conditions, road closures and emergency situations. Users may tune to a specific radio frequency, or call a phone number to listen to a pre-recorded message.<br>
<br>
Disaster and Emergency Messages:<br>
The XMU+ is a simple way to immediately communicate emergency messages to callers. By flipping a switch, or remotely dialing into the XMU+ from a touch tone telephone, announcements can be easily switched to pre-recorded emergency messages. This allows callers to be quickly alerted of problems such as system failures or business changes. <br>
<br>
There are two sizes of XMU+ systems: <br>
Interalia has two sizes of XMU+ systems. The XMU+ large chassis is for solutions requiring up to 64 ports and is capable of handling up to 8 line cards (2-64 ports). The XMU+ small chassis can hold one line card with a maximum of 8 ports and is ideal for smaller systems. Recording time for the XMU+ ranges from 8 minutes up to 6 hours. The XMU+ uses a windows-based software interface to enable remote management of up to 1000 units, with simple downloading of message and configuration files from one location directly via an RS-232 connection, using TCP/IP over a LAN/WAN or remotely via a modem. <br>

                            The VOICE is a digital announcer providing 2, 3 or 4 lines of high quality recorded messages specifically for telephone applications including: ACD/UCD, DID intercept, after-hours, hotel wake-up and general public information announcements. The VOICE can be equipped with 4 minutes of recording time and it can play messages on 2, 3 or 4 lines. The system is simple to install and operate, interfacing with all major telephone systems. <br>
<br>
The VOICEs flexible programming allows the user to configure unique messages to play based on day and time parameters. Up to 9 different messages can be recorded from a handset, downloaded from a tape deck, or recorded remotely via a touch-tone phone. Each message can be assigned to any line, or to all lines, and a user may even link any 2 messages to play one-after-another (i.e. the same message in two languages). The VOICE even allows users to pre-program up to 20 holiday dates that override the standard outgoing message with a special holiday greeting.<br>
<br>
The VOICE includes many additional features. A large back-lit LCD display allows users to easily see the status of the system, program the unit, or perform system administration functions. A daylight savings feature, when activated, automatically adjusts the system time when appropriate. Non-volatile FLASH memory retains all messages during power interruptions, and a built-in clock that allows time-of-day and date-stamping of messages. <br>

                            The Paging Sequencer allows up to 5 pages to be recorded<br>
simultaneously. The frustrating delays encountered when<br>
accessing a paging system are thereby eliminated. The recorded<br>
pages are queued so that the first page recorded plays first<br>
followed by the second page etc.<br>
<br>
. Up to 5 pages may be recorded simultaneously<br>
. Pages may be verified before being played<br>
. Recorded pages play out on a F.I.F.O. basis<br>
. Emergency page override feature<br>
. Up to 17 minutes of recording time<br>
. 2 hour system operating battery backup<br>

                            Interalia&#39;s Automatic Terminal Information System (ATIS) is used by manned and unmanned airports all over the world to transmit information to airplanes. It is ideal for a new airport installation, or it can easily integrate into an existing facility to replace an old broadcast system.  <br>
<br>
Interalias ATIS sytem:<br>
<br>
1. Disseminatesvaluable information to pilots.<br>
The ATIS system transmits information to arriving and departing airplanes 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week without requiring any control tower staff. It is a great way to disseminate valuable information to pilots such as: wind speed, visibility, air temperature, runway/navaid availability, wind direction, NOTAMs (notice to air man), weather advisories and runway conditions. <br>
<br>
2. Reduces mundane communication and increase safety.<br>
The ATIS system reduces the volume of cockpit to control tower communication. While still providing the information pilots need, it eliminates mundane tasks for control tower staff allowing them to focus on more important things such as the safety of planes in their area. <br>
<br>
3. Allows staff to easily update messages.<br>
Although Interalia&#39;s ATIS system plays messages continuously to the transmitters, messages can be easily updated as conditions change without interrupting the current transmission. Personnel can update messages in five different ways without physically having to be at the airport.  Staff have the option to preview the message or re-record it (if necessary) before the new message is transmitted. <br>
<br>
4. Increases productivity with integrated text-to-speech.<br>
Interalia&#39;s ATIS works seamlessly with the StarCaster text-to-speech capability from STR-SpeechTech Ltd. This is a high quality, low-cost speech concantenation technology that automatically creates natural voice message recordings freeing up control tower staff for more productive tasks. <br>
<br>
5. Is useful at manned or unmanned airports.<br>
At unmanned airports with no control tower, Interalia&#39;s ATIS solution may be the only way  to transmit information to arriving and departing airplanes. This same solution can be used at manned airports to offload mundane control tower communication giving staff time to focus on more important tasks. <br>
<br>
6. Integrates into new or existing airports.<br>
Interalia&#39;s ATIS system is ideal for a new airport installation or it can seamlessly replace an outdated broadcast system at an existing airport.<br>
<br>
Typical ATIS Users:<br>
- NAV CANADA <br>
- US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)<br>
- US Air National Guard<br>
- US Air Force<br>
- Raytheon Corporation (Canada)<br>
- AERONAUTICA CIVIL (Colombia)<br>
- Royal Malaysian Air Force<br>

                            The SLA (Single Line Announcer) provides high quality recorded messages for telephone applications including: ACD/UCD, DID intercept, after-hours answer, hotel wake-up, multi-language announcements, holiday greetings and general public information announcements<br>
<br>
The SLA is a solid-state digital announcer designed for continuous maintenance-free operation. It is simple to install, and compatible with all major telephone systems. The SLA uses non-volatile FLASH memory to retain recorded messages during power interruptions without the need for battery backup. <br>
<br>
The SLA has a single line that can play 1 or 2 messages for a total recording time of one minute. Messages can be recorded into the unit from a handset or downloaded from a tape deck so the user has complete control over what the caller hears. The messages can be played individually, or linked to play one after another (i.e. the same message in two languages). Day and night/holiday messages or multi-language messages may also be pre-recorded. <br>
<br>
The SLA:<br>
<br>
1. Easily integrates into existing phone systems:<br>
The SLA is simple to install and operate, easily integrating into your existing telephone system.  <br>
<br>
2. Is highly reliable so it won&#39;t break down:<br>
The SLA is a reliable digital announcer with no moving parts to break down so you can count on it to answer when you need it. <br>
<br>
3. Is an affordable way to deliver high quality messages:<br>
The SLA is so affordable it allows even the smallest company to have a high quality, professional sounding system without a lot of expense. <br>
<br>
4. Can be used it for a variety of applications:<br>
The SLA is so versatile it can be used to play general messages, after-hour announcements, holiday greetings or multi-language information. <br>
<br>
5. Switches between two messages:<br>
With the SLA, you can manually switch between two messages. This means the SLA can be used to play an after-hours announcement once your office has closed, or a holiday greeting on a specific date. <br>
<br>
6. Plays messages separately or linked-to each other:<br>
With the SLA, you can set the two messages to play one after another (for multi-language messages) or independently (day message and after-hours message). <br>
<br>
<br>
The SLA has many great features including:  <br>
  <br>
1. Easily records or download messages:<br>
With the SLA you can easily record a message directly from a handset or download multiple messages from a tape deck. <br>
<br>
2. Recording time for up to two messages:<br>
The SLA has one announcement channel with one minute of total recording time that can be allocated between one or two messages. <br>
<br>
3. Simultaneously plays and records:<br>
The SLA lets you record new messages without interrupting existing messages that are already playing on the unit. <br>
<br>
4. Retains messages even in power failures:<br>
The SLA uses nonvolatile FLASH memory so it retains all messages even during power interruptions. <br>

                            The Interalia iProMOH is a solid state music and message announcer specifically designed for music-on-hold, background music, and overhead paging applications. It is excellent for businesses that wish to promote products and services to on-hold customers in a general business environment or a call queue in a call centre. The iProMOH can work either as a single-site solution or part of a multi-site environment and its plugn play design and network interface ensures it will easily operate with any new or existing telephony system. The iProMOH can turn your public address system into a powerful marketing tool by playing messages and music that entertain and inform shoppers and/or workers.<br>
<br>
The iProMOH is an affordable and intelligent music and message-on-hold announcer that solves all the typical problems associated with promotional on-hold and in-store announcement systems. You dont have to waste time plugging cassettes into an on-hold announcer, or waiting for technical staff to update messages because the iProMOH can automatically update its own messages remotely via the internet.<br>
<br>
The Interalia iProMOH is 2 solutions in one: a digital announcer that can entertain and inform on-hold callers and an in-store public address system for broadcasting music and/or messages to store patrons. <br>
<br>
1. The iProMOH plays music and messages for on-hold callers: <br>
You can use the iProMOH to play messages and/or music to callers that are put on-hold, entertaining and educating them about new products, advertising or frequently asked questions. <br>
<br>
2. The iProMOH plays overhead announcements:<br>
The iProMOH turns your public address system into a powerful marketing tool by playing messages to introduce products or services, answer questions, or promote store campaigns and advertising. <br>
<br>
3. The iProMOH plays background music: <br>
The iProMOH is a great device for playing background or foreground music to entertain shoppers at your business.  <br>
<br>
4. The iProMOH is a flexible single or multi-site solution: <br>
The iProMOH is available as a single site unit with administration done directly at the unit via a network connection from a PC. Or with the optional iCAS administration software for multi-site management, an iProMOH can be administered remotely via the internet from a host system.  <br>
<br>
Note: You must have one copy of the iCAS software installed in your network for an iProMOH network to run. This iCAS can manage one or more iProMOH units on the network. <br>
<br>
5. You can manage the iProMOH yourself or contract out:<br>
As a single site, or part of a multi-site solution, you have the flexibility to administer the iProMOH yourself or have it managed by a separate third party.   <br>
<br>
6. The host can tell the iProMOH to download new files:<br>
If there are files to be updated, administrators can tell the iProMOH to initiate a download from the iCAS host workstation. This enables administrators to control exactly when messages get updated into one or more iProMOH units.<br>
<br>
7. The iProMOH can updates its own music and message files:<br>
The iProMOH is so intelligent it can update its music and message files by calling out over a firewall friendly internet connection to a host workstation at scheduled intervals. It then automatically downloads new files directly from the host into itself.<br>
<br>
8. The iProMOH plays music and messages from various sources:<br>
The iProMOH plays pre-recorded messages, pre-recorded music, blended music/messages, or messages cross-faded with music from an external source such as a live satellite feed, or internal music bed.<br>
<br>
9. The iProMOH can from multiple music choices or message beds:<br>
The iProMOH can store unique music or message beds so it can play a set of general day music/messages then automatically switch to a different set after your business has closed. This feature can also be used to turn holiday greetings on or off.<br>
<br>
10. The iProMOH has hours of recording time:<br>
Most cassette systems only have minutes of recording time, the iProMOH has up to 3 hours so you can have more messages and they can be longer too.<br>
<br>
11. The iProMOH smoothly cross-faced between music and messages:<br>
The iProMOH smoothly cross-fades between independent music and message beds so you can re-record messages as often as you want without having to pay for the music to be re-mixed.<br>
<br>
12. The iProMOH has easy multi-site management:<br>
Music and Messages can easily be downloaded into one or more iProMOHs remotely over the internet without anyone physically going to that location. <br>
<br>
13. The iProMOH automatically converts files to the right format:<br>
The iProMOH automatically converts MP3, WAV, OGG or WMA files to a suitable format.<br>
<br>
14.  The iProMOH plays pre-timed P.A. announcements:<br>
The iProMOH plays P.A. messages such as store opening or closing announcements at the exact pre-scheduled time you want. <br>
<br>
15. The iProMOH can play MOH for different queues:<br>
The iProMOH can play two completely different MOH productions to two unique call queues without needing a separate MOH box for each.<br>
<br>
16. The iProMOH has higher quality sound:<br>
iProMOHs provide a much higher quality sound than most cassette-type systems so your customers only hear the best.<br>
<br>
17. The iProMOH allows you to pre-schedule music and messages:<br>
Music and messages can be downloaded into the iProMOH days or weeks in advance then automatically played at the exact time you want.<br>
<br>
18. The iProMOH does not require technical staff onsite:<br>
You do not require technical staff to go onsite to install new updates. It is so easy to update the iProMOH via the internet that even non-technical staff can download new music and message files into the unit.<br>

                            The XMU+ fills the void between simple passive announcers and expensive voicemail or IVR systems. It is a cost effective announcement, call processing and music/message-on-hold system with state-of-the-art design, and flexible configuration options that enables managers to deliver the same functionality as more elaborate systems, but at a fraction of the cost. The Interalia XMU+ is compatible with all major telephone systems, and very easy to install and operate. <br>
<br>
The XMU+ is Interalias next generation advanced announcement, call processing and music or messaging-on-hold system. It is an ideal solution for any industry needing: auto attendant, ACD announcements, music/messaging-on-hold, interactive audiotex, call processing and basic IVR functionality. Our customers find that when they move applications to the XMU+ from more expensive IVR and voicemail systems, they save money while delivering the same functionality. <br>
<br>
The XMU+ allows companies to provide callers with a variety of messages without requiring a dedicated port for each message, and it is easy to change an announcement message so callers only receive the most up-to-date information. <br>
<br>
The XMU+:<br>
1. Allows callers to choose extensions (dial-by-name).<br>
2. Answers and transfers calls (call processing).<br>
3. Prompts callers and routes calls (auto attendant).<br>
4. Notifies callers when agents are unavailable (ACD Announcements).<br>
5. Prompts Callers to have information available.<br>
6. Entertains callers with Music/Messaging-On-Hold.<br>
7. Answers calls after closing (after-hour attendant).<br>
8. Provides answers to questions (interactive audiotex).<br>
9. Delivers information 24 hours-a-day (information lines).<br>
10. Provides hotel wake-up functionality.<br>
11. Delivers weather and emergency broadcasts.<br>
12. Broadcasts disaster and emergency messages.<br>
<br>
<br>
The XMU+ is an excellent solution for:<br>
- Call processing <br>
- Auto Attendant <br>
- ACD announcements <br>
- Music/Messaging-on-hold <br>
- After-Hour Attendant <br>
- Interactive Audiotex <br>
- Information Lines <br>
- Hotel Wake-up <br>
- Weather and Emergency Broadcasts <br>
- Disaster and Emergency Messages<br>
<br>
Call Processing:<br>
The XMU+ helps companies transfer calls when operators are not available. It front-ends main telephone lines prompting callers for the location they want to be directed to, then transferring those callers to the appropriate location. The XMU+ can direct callers to: ACD queues, IVR ports, departments, voicemail or informational messages. It is a great solution to reduce caller frustration, offload IVR or voicemail and process high volumes of calls. <br>
<br>
Auto Attendant:<br>
The XMU+ is an excellent solution for any business that cant justify expensive call handling solutions or additional operators. It delivers efficient and affordable automated attendant functionality to outside callers and internal staff. The XMU+ prompts callers for the extension they want, then quickly routes the call to that extension or to the requested audiotex information. If you need auto attendant functionality, the XMU+ is a great way to provide 24-hour access to extensions and information.<br>
<br>
ACD Announcements:<br>
Even with voicemails popularity callers still have the need to talk to a live agent. When agents are not available and callers have to be put on-hold, the XMU+ can be used to notify callers of a delay. It can play a variety of interesting ACD announcements until an agent is available to take their call. These messages may provide product information, promote services or educate callers about the company. The XMU+ can also be used to prompt callers to have information available before talking to a live agent (credit card numbers, account information, etc.) Using the XMU+ for ACD announcements helps prepare the caller, speeds up call processing and occupies the caller while they wait on-hold.<br>
<br>
Music/Messaging-On-Hold:<br>
The XMU+ can occupy callers while they wait on-hold by playing a variety of music and messages. When callers are entertained and informed while waiting on-hold, time goes by faster and they experience less frustration.<br>
<br>
After-Hour Attendant:<br>
When offices or stores close the XMU+ continues to answer calls and transfer callers to extensions, information, or even other offices in different parts of the world.  This  means  callers  can  still  speak  to  a  representative even after the office has closed for the day.<br>
<br>
Interactive Audiotex:<br>
The XMU+ is a great solution for interactive audiotex applications  because  it  can  provide  answers  to  frequently asked questions such as: store hours, locations, services and special promotions. Interactive audiotex has many benefits: callers receive the answers they need without waiting on-hold, calls are processed faster, and existing staff have more time to help customers that require personal assistance.<br>
<br>
Information Lines:<br>
The XMU+ is a great way to provide general information to the public or staff. Many companies use it to deliver: student information lines, 24-hour health information, concert and sporting event details, or human resource information. Any time of the day, callers are able to quickly get the information they need without waiting on-hold to talk to an agent.<br>
<br>
Hotel Wake-Up:<br>
The Interalia XMU+ easily interfaces with hotel telephone systems to play announcements for guest wake-up. Hotels can inform guests about dining room specials, tours, weather forecasts, and hotel facilities.<br>
<br>
Weather and Emergency Broadcasts:<br>
Government departments use Interalia products to broadcast weather conditions, road closures and emergency situations. Users may tune to a specific radio frequency, or call a phone number to listen to a pre-recorded message.<br>
<br>
Disaster and Emergency Messages:<br>
The XMU+ is a simple way to immediately communicate emergency messages to callers. By flipping a switch, or remotely dialing into the XMU+ from a touch tone telephone, announcements can be easily switched to pre-recorded emergency messages. This allows callers to be quickly alerted of problems such as system failures or business changes. <br>
<br>
There are two sizes of XMU+ systems: <br>
Interalia has two sizes of XMU+ systems. The XMU+ large chassis is for solutions requiring up to 64 ports and is capable of handling up to 8 line cards (2-64 ports). The XMU+ small chassis can hold one line card with a maximum of 8 ports and is ideal for smaller systems. Recording time for the XMU+ ranges from 8 minutes up to 6 hours. The XMU+ uses a windows-based software interface to enable remote management of up to 1000 units, with simple downloading of message and configuration files from one location directly via an RS-232 connection, using TCP/IP over a LAN/WAN or remotely via a modem. <br>

                            The VOICE is a digital announcer providing 2, 3 or 4 lines of high quality recorded messages specifically for telephone applications including: ACD/UCD, DID intercept, after-hours, hotel wake-up and general public information announcements. The VOICE can be equipped with 4 minutes of recording time and it can play messages on 2, 3 or 4 lines. The system is simple to install and operate, interfacing with all major telephone systems. <br>
<br>
The VOICEs flexible programming allows the user to configure unique messages to play based on day and time parameters. Up to 9 different messages can be recorded from a handset, downloaded from a tape deck, or recorded remotely via a touch-tone phone. Each message can be assigned to any line, or to all lines, and a user may even link any 2 messages to play one-after-another (i.e. the same message in two languages). The VOICE even allows users to pre-program up to 20 holiday dates that override the standard outgoing message with a special holiday greeting.<br>
<br>
The VOICE includes many additional features. A large back-lit LCD display allows users to easily see the status of the system, program the unit, or perform system administration functions. A daylight savings feature, when activated, automatically adjusts the system time when appropriate. Non-volatile FLASH memory retains all messages during power interruptions, and a built-in clock that allows time-of-day and date-stamping of messages. <br>

                            Interalia&#39;s Automatic Terminal Information System (ATIS) is used by manned and unmanned airports all over the world to transmit information to airplanes. It is ideal for a new airport installation, or it can easily integrate into an existing facility to replace an old broadcast system.  <br>
<br>
Interalias ATIS sytem:<br>
<br>
1. Disseminatesvaluable information to pilots.<br>
The ATIS system transmits information to arriving and departing airplanes 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week without requiring any control tower staff. It is a great way to disseminate valuable information to pilots such as: wind speed, visibility, air temperature, runway/navaid availability, wind direction, NOTAMs (notice to air man), weather advisories and runway conditions. <br>
<br>
2. Reduces mundane communication and increase safety.<br>
The ATIS system reduces the volume of cockpit to control tower communication. While still providing the information pilots need, it eliminates mundane tasks for control tower staff allowing them to focus on more important things such as the safety of planes in their area. <br>
<br>
3. Allows staff to easily update messages.<br>
Although Interalia&#39;s ATIS system plays messages continuously to the transmitters, messages can be easily updated as conditions change without interrupting the current transmission. Personnel can update messages in five different ways without physically having to be at the airport.  Staff have the option to preview the message or re-record it (if necessary) before the new message is transmitted. <br>
<br>
4. Increases productivity with integrated text-to-speech.<br>
Interalia&#39;s ATIS works seamlessly with the StarCaster text-to-speech capability from STR-SpeechTech Ltd. This is a high quality, low-cost speech concantenation technology that automatically creates natural voice message recordings freeing up control tower staff for more productive tasks. <br>
<br>
5. Is useful at manned or unmanned airports.<br>
At unmanned airports with no control tower, Interalia&#39;s ATIS solution may be the only way  to transmit information to arriving and departing airplanes. This same solution can be used at manned airports to offload mundane control tower communication giving staff time to focus on more important tasks. <br>
<br>
6. Integrates into new or existing airports.<br>
Interalia&#39;s ATIS system is ideal for a new airport installation or it can seamlessly replace an outdated broadcast system at an existing airport.<br>
<br>
Typical ATIS Users:<br>
- NAV CANADA <br>
- US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)<br>
- US Air National Guard<br>
- US Air Force<br>
- Raytheon Corporation (Canada)<br>
- AERONAUTICA CIVIL (Colombia)<br>
- Royal Malaysian Air Force<br>

                            The Interalia iProMOH is a solid state music and message announcer specifically designed for music-on-hold, background music, and overhead paging applications. It is excellent for businesses that wish to promote products and services to on-hold customers in a general business environment or a call queue in a call centre. The iProMOH can work either as a single-site solution or part of a multi-site environment and its plugn play design and network interface ensures it will easily operate with any new or existing telephony system. The iProMOH can turn your public address system into a powerful marketing tool by playing messages and music that entertain and inform shoppers and/or workers.<br>
<br>
The iProMOH is an affordable and intelligent music and message-on-hold announcer that solves all the typical problems associated with promotional on-hold and in-store announcement systems. You dont have to waste time plugging cassettes into an on-hold announcer, or waiting for technical staff to update messages because the iProMOH can automatically update its own messages remotely via the internet.<br>
<br>
The Interalia iProMOH is 2 solutions in one: a digital announcer that can entertain and inform on-hold callers and an in-store public address system for broadcasting music and/or messages to store patrons. <br>
<br>
1. The iProMOH plays music and messages for on-hold callers: <br>
You can use the iProMOH to play messages and/or music to callers that are put on-hold, entertaining and educating them about new products, advertising or frequently asked questions. <br>
<br>
2. The iProMOH plays overhead announcements:<br>
The iProMOH turns your public address system into a powerful marketing tool by playing messages to introduce products or services, answer questions, or promote store campaigns and advertising. <br>
<br>
3. The iProMOH plays background music: <br>
The iProMOH is a great device for playing background or foreground music to entertain shoppers at your business.  <br>
<br>
4. The iProMOH is a flexible single or multi-site solution: <br>
The iProMOH is available as a single site unit with administration done directly at the unit via a network connection from a PC. Or with the optional iCAS administration software for multi-site management, an iProMOH can be administered remotely via the internet from a host system.  <br>
<br>
Note: You must have one copy of the iCAS software installed in your network for an iProMOH network to run. This iCAS can manage one or more iProMOH units on the network. <br>
<br>
5. You can manage the iProMOH yourself or contract out:<br>
As a single site, or part of a multi-site solution, you have the flexibility to administer the iProMOH yourself or have it managed by a separate third party.   <br>
<br>
6. The host can tell the iProMOH to download new files:<br>
If there are files to be updated, administrators can tell the iProMOH to initiate a download from the iCAS host workstation. This enables administrators to control exactly when messages get updated into one or more iProMOH units.<br>
<br>
7. The iProMOH can updates its own music and message files:<br>
The iProMOH is so intelligent it can update its music and message files by calling out over a firewall friendly internet connection to a host workstation at scheduled intervals. It then automatically downloads new files directly from the host into itself.<br>
<br>
8. The iProMOH plays music and messages from various sources:<br>
The iProMOH plays pre-recorded messages, pre-recorded music, blended music/messages, or messages cross-faded with music from an external source such as a live satellite feed, or internal music bed.<br>
<br>
9. The iProMOH can from multiple music choices or message beds:<br>
The iProMOH can store unique music or message beds so it can play a set of general day music/messages then automatically switch to a different set after your business has closed. This feature can also be used to turn holiday greetings on or off.<br>
<br>
10. The iProMOH has hours of recording time:<br>
Most cassette systems only have minutes of recording time, the iProMOH has up to 3 hours so you can have more messages and they can be longer too.<br>
<br>
11. The iProMOH smoothly cross-faced between music and messages:<br>
The iProMOH smoothly cross-fades between independent music and message beds so you can re-record messages as often as you want without having to pay for the music to be re-mixed.<br>
<br>
12. The iProMOH has easy multi-site management:<br>
Music and Messages can easily be downloaded into one or more iProMOHs remotely over the internet without anyone physically going to that location. <br>
<br>
13. The iProMOH automatically converts files to the right format:<br>
The iProMOH automatically converts MP3, WAV, OGG or WMA files to a suitable format.<br>
<br>
14.  The iProMOH plays pre-timed P.A. announcements:<br>
The iProMOH plays P.A. messages such as store opening or closing announcements at the exact pre-scheduled time you want. <br>
<br>
15. The iProMOH can play MOH for different queues:<br>
The iProMOH can play two completely different MOH productions to two unique call queues without needing a separate MOH box for each.<br>
<br>
16. The iProMOH has higher quality sound:<br>
iProMOHs provide a much higher quality sound than most cassette-type systems so your customers only hear the best.<br>
<br>
17. The iProMOH allows you to pre-schedule music and messages:<br>
Music and messages can be downloaded into the iProMOH days or weeks in advance then automatically played at the exact time you want.<br>
<br>
18. The iProMOH does not require technical staff onsite:<br>
You do not require technical staff to go onsite to install new updates. It is so easy to update the iProMOH via the internet that even non-technical staff can download new music and message files into the unit.<br>
