        <br>            Angels of Flight Canada Inc.          www.angelsofflightcanada.com<br><br>The President and CEO of Angels of Flight Canada began her career as a Critical Care Nurse in a hospital ICU.  In 1986, independent of the air ambulance program being developed with rotary aircraft and paramedic medical care but in coordination with the Ministry of Health, smaller hospitals in Ontario started utilizing their critical care nurse employees as medical care providers and escorts to their critical patients transported by fixed wing aircraft to major medical centres, in Toronto. <br><br>As a Critical Care Nurse in Peterborough, Ms. Courneyea was requested by the hospital to provide medical care for patients being transported by fixed wing aircraft to Toronto from the Peterborough area. At that time, the aircraft operated by private companies under contract to the Ontario Ministry of Health and utilizing Ministry of Health standards, were underequipped for medical transport and there was no available specialized medical, emergency or environmental training available in Canada to prepare a Nurse for patient care or emergency training for this new patient transport environment. Air medical transport by fixed wing aircraft with nurses providing the onboard patient medical care continued to gain popularity during this time period as Hospitals in Ontario working with the Ministry of Health found this the most efficient and effective way to transport their critical care patients. Now as an experienced Nurse having carried out several air medical transports and recognizing the potential difficulties associated with medical treatments being carried out in an aircraft environment Ms. Courneyea quickly realized the need for further training to provide healthcare for patients in an environment that was often chaotic and unfamiliar. <br><br>Flight nurses needed to learn how to prepare their patients for air transfer physically, psychologically and administratively because of the inherent stresses associated with this type of transport. By becoming trained, nurses could prepare and minimize or cope with any patient complication that could arise. Ms. Courneyea sought out specialized aeromedical training provided only in the U.S. at this time. Graduating from these programs and being one of the first graduates of the only Canadian aeromedical program offered at Seneca College Ms. Courneyea continued her quest for excellence in aeromedical nursing by furthering her education and training. She understood that in order to have success in air medical transport and a continuation of hospital patient care, nurses must know the environment extremely well. Learned skill sets beyond the medical training included aviation orientation, flight physiology, pathophysiology, communication skills, and safety and emergency procedures as well as becoming well versed in specialized medical equipment used for this type of transport. Flight nurses needed to have an ability to improvise in this a variable environment, far different than that of a hospital with full complement of staffing, medical equipment, drugs and other resources. <br><br><br><br>In the late 1980s hospitals wished to continue to use critical care nurses as medical care providers and escorts to their critical patients transported by fixed wing aircraft to major medical centres, in Toronto however the practice of utilizing nurse employees at the hospital was discontinued. <br><br>Recognizing the need for highly trained nurses in this aeromedical environment, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. was incorporated by Ms. Courneyea in December 1988 offering specialized patient transportation services by both land and air and in January 1989, the first air international ambulance flight took place with two of Angels of Flight principal flight trained nurses providing the patient care.  <br><br>Angels of Flight Canada gained its wings from 1988 on as the company moved forward by implementing a flight nursing program in-house for nurses flying on air ambulances as well as commercial airlines. The program advanced the training of registered nurses by teaching flight physiology and pathphysiology, preparation of patients for flight, high altitude training, in-flight safety and wilderness survival. As the foremost provider of qualified flight nurses in Ontario, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. signed its first contract to work directly with Ontario hospitals to coordinate air ambulance flights and supply flight registered nurses within the province.<br><br>To meet the demands for these services, in 1991, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. opened an office at the Toronto Island Airport and operational bases were set up in Timmins, Sault St. Marie, Dryden and Sudbury to supply nurses for Ontario air ambulances in those areas. <br><br>Value Added  Experience and Knowledge of Air Ambulance Services and Airline Repatriations<br>- Ontario air services - documented above.<br>- Across Canada and to/from 104 countries globally - Co-ordinate the movement of patients, by recognizing all risks in care and transportation and  implementing risk management protocol - have resulted in 100% safe transfer of patients globally. <br>- Successful &quot;Bed-Find&quot; both in Canada and around the world have resulted in early movement of patients and  a financial savings in Canadian Healthcare and a strong network of supportive and client relationships with healthcare facilities in Canada and Internationally, physicians and nurses.<br>- A lengthy relationship built on Trust, Knowledge and Experience exists with our government clients such as  Department of Foreign Affairs , Foreign Embassies and Canada Border Services. <br>- Moved ill/injured patients safely to/from as far south as Ushuaia (southernmost city in the world) , the remote northwest location of  the Beaufort Sea and from Ellesmere Island in the north east (off-limit even for air ambulance service) and countries around the world.<br>- Have become the &quot;problem solver&quot; for difficult cases globally - work with clients until a solution is found and implemented to successfully move ill/injured patients over long distances. <br>- Founded a business model for global repatriation services that has been used successfully for more than two decades.<br>Education - www.exodusstudies.com<br><br>As a natural follow-up to the aeromedical training programs designed and implemented by Angels of Flight Canada Inc. in 1993 the company formalized its educational training and development by commencing a new division, Exodus Academy of Air Medical Studies, the forerunner of the current division, Exodus Studies. This division provided an in-house educational environment where qualified registered nurses could receive their certification for aeromedical transport, meeting the standards for this service as set by Angels of Flight Canada Inc.<br>Today as learning trends have developed and changed over the years, Exodus Studies continues to develop and provide medical education and training programs to health care providers, physicians, registered nurses, paramedics, travelers, flight crews, flight attendants and allied professionals globally and  has expanded its educational programs to include training in workplace health and safety, travel health and safety,  non-emergency patient transfer courses as well as their aeromedical training programs.<br> In order to provide a 21st century learning environment, Exodus Studies have platformed their programs on their own state of the art Learning Management System, LMS. <br><br> Value -Added Experience &amp; Education:<br>- Designed air medical courses and presented them to healthcare and aviation personal in various cities in Canada and USA at colleges, hospitals and conferences.<br>- Preceptor program (each 12 weeks) in 1990&#39;s for final year nursing students in both Colleges and Universities.  Provided an opportunity to travel with our Flight nurses caring for patients&#39; in the out-of-hospital phase of their illness/injury. <br>- Our nurses participate in air medical flight and airline conferences &amp; training sessions throughout USA to upgrade and enhance their specialized air medical programs. Locations include Boston, Salt Lake City, Hollywood, St Louis, Kansas City, Denver (Not Available in Canada)<br>- Participate in Flight Safety Programs with Transport Canada encompassing all factors of safety in the air ambulance environment and Global Airline Safety with SCSI, California.<br>- More than five flight nurses have been on board three of the Ministry of Health Ontario air ambulances in Ontario that were involved in air crashes in the early 1990s. This unique  introduction to emergency procedures, regulations, protocols and investigations enhanced our  understanding of government operations and investigations. <br>- High Altitude Training, at Downsview along with Winter Wilderness Survival Adventures under the direction and supervision of Search &amp; Rescue personal from Trenton Ontario added tremendous value to our education experience and planning for not only our personal safety but that of our patient entrusted to our care.<br>- In 2007, we organized a successful Air Medical Flight Safety Conference  held in King City, Ontario with renowned International and Federal Government speakers. Attendees included air-sea rescue helicopter physicians from as far away as Australia. This was the first conference highlighting this subject in Canada and was opened by our local Federal MP. <br>- 2009-2011 - Moved to provide E-Learning solution for our staff orientation and continuous education.  Now in 2012,  this is being offered globally to clients seeking air medical programs, travel safety and a number of other courses. <br><br>Ground Ambulance Transportation<br><br>Beginning in 1995 and1996 with the Ontario Health Services Restructuring Commission, the landscape of Ontario&#39;s healthcare began to change. As a result of restructuring and regionalization of healthcare services, Ontario patients were often moved through the healthcare system from facility to facility for care. Patients could no longer expect to have all their healthcare needs met at a single facility. Angels of Flight Canada Inc. quickly realized that with changes being contemplated to patient ground transportation systems by the prioritization of patient transportation between Ontario healthcare facilities by defining emergent transfers or life threatening, urgent or time sensitive and non-urgent there was a need to create a non-emergent patient ground transportation service and in 1995 the Angels of Flight ground service division was created with teams of trained Paramedics and EMTs operating a ground transportation system with medically equipped trucks. At this time, our priority was to ensure the timely movement of patients to airports for International flights. As emergency medical services continued to evolve under the priority classification system utilizing public EMS units primarily for emergent or life threatening transport, the need for transportation of urgent and non-urgent patients began to grow and soon Angels of Flight Canada signed contracts to provide non-emergent patient transportation to several hospitals and Community Care Access Centres in the York and Durham regions of Ontario, roughly 4,366 square kilometers with a current service population area of 1,792,600 persons. <br>Servicing these contracts and meeting these facilitys needs required a fleet of 10 ambulance and 2 medical support vehicles and 45 transfer staff alone, approximately the same size as many of the provincially funded EMS public ambulance services including Peterborough.  This ground transportation service also served to transport Angels of Flights air ambulance and airline clients to and from aircraft utilized by our company in the air medical patient transportation service. <br><br>Value Added Experience and Knowledge of Ground Ambulance Service<br><br>- Management of paramedics and support staff  including, education needs, human resources, documentation, personal needs, scheduling, etc. at a distance from the main office. <br>- Dispatch dedicated and supervised by nurses and physicians moving patients between facilities in a timely manner and safely- interface with hospitals, physicians, and allied support providers.<br>- Fleet management that encompassed; volume purchasing of vehicles, maintenance and service needs (only by accredited ambulance service mechanics), medical supplies, our own software vehicle maintenance tracker, GPS systems, radio communication systems - many of these were implemented before the publically EMS system had them in place. <br>- Electronic Medical Records (EMR) set up in spring of 2010 creating an ease of record transfer between facilities and crews, improved confidentiality, and of course &quot;going green&quot;  spin-off. The land ambulance crews uses computers on board to record data and it is them uploaded to our EMR - cloud storage which allows to access our secure records from anywhere globally.<br>- Learning Management System (LMS) provides an educational platform for continuous training and education for employees to maintain and update their proficiency and skills with current programming and technology. Developed and provide specific programming for non-emergency transport.<br><br>Standards for Quality - ISO 9001-2008 ®<br><br>Since its inception back in the early 1980s Angels of Flight Canada Inc. has always developed their business model on their patients health and safety first and quality of service. To this end, Angels of Flight Canada became the first company in Canada specializing in air and ground medical transport globally to achieve an ISO rating for quality assurance and procedural and policy standards back in 2004 and continues to this day with an ISO 9001-2008 exemplifying the role of standards and conformity of services to International Standards and providing assurance of the companys quality, safety, efficiency and reliability.  <br>We also maintain a Triple &quot;A&quot; rating with the Better Business Bureau.<br><br>Medical Tourism<br><br>The provision of healthcare since the 1980s in Canada and the Provinces has been constantly evolving to try and meet the needs of an aging population. Since the early 1980s total healthcare spending in Ontario represented approximately 30% of the total provincial budget. Today it represents approximately 42% of the provinces total budget and aging *Baby Boomers will only drive the need higher. Today with the demand for health services getting increasingly higher and the government trying to balance cost versus service patients are experiencing significant wait times and delays for medical procedures, tests and other medical services. In response to this reality, over the past few years a new medical phenomenon has evolved known as medical tourism. Canadians are slowly starting to look at options through medical tourism opportunities to get certain <br>procedures such as joint replacement, cardiac surgeries, cosmetic treatments and dental procedures in other countries usually at a reduced cost and certainly much faster initiation time. <br>*baby boomer is a person who was born during the demographic Post-World War II baby boom and who grew up during the period  <br>  between 1946 and 1964<br>Having now travelled to more than 105 countries worldwide, carrying out air medical repatriations and medical escorts, and with over 25 years of experience, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. always a visionary in medical air travel requirements, entered into the field of medical tourism with the creation of their medical tourism division.<br><br>Angels Global Healthcare was formed in 2009 to facilitate safe and reliable access to medical services worldwide, offering personalized medical tourism services. Angels Global Healthcare became only the second medical tourism provider in Canada to achieve certification as a Medical Tourism Facilitator by the American Medical Tourism Association is a member of the Medical Tourism Association, Travel health Insurance Assoc. and has achieved a +AAA rating with the Better Business Bureau.<br>Summary<br><br>Since its inception in 1988, Angels of Flight has been a visionary and a leader in the field of air and ground medical transport. From recognizing the need for further education and training for flight nurse medical nurse escorts when the practice of flying critically ill patients by fixed wing aircraft to major medical centres from outlying hospitals became a preferred method with the Ontario Ministry of Health to understanding the need to prioritize ground medical transport to maintain service levels and cost efficiencies, Ms. Courneyea and her company Angels of Flight Canada Inc. have not only identified the need she has created a capacity to fill that need. <br>The Ontario Government through the Ministry of Health since the late 1970s have created an air ambulance service that featured a paramedic-based system of care, with the presence of physicians or nurses being relatively unusual. Helicopters can be seen as substitutes for ground ambulances, because they can land almost anywhere but fuel capacity gives them a relatively short range. They typically serve patients in true emergency situations, where quick access to a trauma center is literally a matter of life and death. An important difference in the Ontario program involved the emphasis of service. &quot;On scene&quot; calls were taken, although less commonly, and a great deal of the initial emphasis of the program was on the inter-hospital transfer of critical care patients. This trend continues to this day with about 80% of all call volume for air ambulance being transfers between medical facilities.<br>Airplanes are less flexible then helicopters about where they can land and take off they are typically not used to transport patients from the scene of the emergency to the hospital. Airplanes do have a much longer range than helicopters do, so they can travel farther distances without refueling and they can still offer life-supporting care for patients who are critically ill or injured. Globally, fixed-wing air ambulances are more often used to transport patients from one hospital to another. Angels of Flight Canada Inc. was originally created and designed to deliver optimal care by providing expertise to ill and injured people during intra-hospital transportation and will continue to focus on the need to provide a continuum of hospital care during intra-hospital transfers where the health of a critically ill person is more susceptible to deterioration. At Angels, we believe that the future of air medical intra-facility transport worldwide needs to be about appropriate aircraft with sophisticated and miniaturized medical equipment, staffed by qualified medical personnel no longer considered to be merely passengers in a plane but vital members of the crew to ensure safety for the patient and all others on board. Medical personnel will be mandated to undergo specialized and recurrent training to fly on the aircraft and specialty teams will have at least one specially trained flight medical crew on the aircraft. <br>Based on future projections for provincial health budgets and patients future medical requirements and demands on the healthcare system, improvements to patients health balanced with cost efficiencies will involve not only higher standards in quality, types and levels of air medical transport but government regulations and controls with appropriate funding levels to support high quality and cost effective ground intra-facility transport as well.<br>Consulting Services Internationally<br>Numerous International projects and programs in both LAND &amp; AIR ambulance restructuring services and flight medical logistics  in countries such as - Trinidad, Barbados, Libya, Mexico, Costa Rica, Haiti and Jamaica. <br>Community Support  <br>Continuing support within local communities and International projects such as Haiti.<br><br>

                            Recognizing the need for highly trained nurses in this aeromedical environment, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. was incorporated by Ms. Courneyea in December 1988 offering specialized patient transportation services by both land and air and in January 1989, the first air international ambulance flight took place with two of Angels of Flight principal flight trained nurses providing the patient care.  <br>
<br>
Angels of Flight Canada gained its wings from 1988 on as the company moved forward by implementing a flight nursing program in-house for nurses flying on air ambulances as well as commercial airlines. The program advanced the training of registered nurses by teaching flight physiology and pathphysiology, preparation of patients for flight, high altitude training, in-flight safety and wilderness survival. As the foremost provider of qualified flight nurses in Ontario, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. signed its first contract to work directly with Ontario hospitals to coordinate air ambulance flights and supply flight registered nurses within the province.<br>
<br>
To meet the demands for these services, in 1991, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. opened an office at the Toronto Island Airport and operational bases were set up in Timmins, Sault St. Marie, Dryden and Sudbury to supply nurses for Ontario air ambulances in those areas. <br>
<br>

                            Ground Ambulance Transportation<br>
<br>
Beginning in 1995 and1996 with the Ontario Health Services Restructuring Commission, the landscape of Ontario&#39;s healthcare began to change. As a result of restructuring and regionalization of healthcare services, Ontario patients were often moved through the healthcare system from facility to facility for care. Patients could no longer expect to have all their healthcare needs met at a single facility. Angels of Flight Canada Inc. quickly realized that with changes being contemplated to patient ground transportation systems by the prioritization of patient transportation between Ontario healthcare facilities by defining emergent transfers or life threatening, urgent or time sensitive and non-urgent there was a need to create a non-emergent patient ground transportation service and in 1995 the Angels of Flight ground service division was created with teams of trained Paramedics and EMTs operating a ground transportation system with medically equipped trucks. At this time, our priority was to ensure the timely movement of patients to airports for International flights. As emergency medical services continued to evolve under the priority classification system utilizing public EMS units primarily for emergent or life threatening transport, the need for transportation of urgent and non-urgent patients began to grow and soon Angels of Flight Canada signed contracts to provide non-emergent patient transportation to several hospitals and Community Care Access Centres in the York and Durham regions of Ontario, roughly 4,366 square kilometers with a current service population area of 1,792,600 persons. <br>
Servicing these contracts and meeting these facilitys needs required a fleet of 10 ambulance and 2 medical support vehicles and 45 transfer staff alone, approximately the same size as many of the provincially funded EMS public ambulance services including Peterborough.  This ground transportation service also served to transport Angels of Flights air ambulance and airline clients to and from aircraft utilized by our company in the air medical patient transportation service. <br>
<br>
Value Added Experience and Knowledge of Ground Ambulance Service<br>
<br>
- Management of paramedics and support staff  including, education needs, human resources, documentation, personal needs, scheduling, etc. at a distance from the main office. <br>
- Dispatch dedicated and supervised by nurses and physicians moving patients between facilities in a timely manner and safely- interface with hospitals, physicians, and allied support providers.<br>
- Fleet management that encompassed; volume purchasing of vehicles, maintenance and service needs (only by accredited ambulance service mechanics), medical supplies, our own software vehicle maintenance tracker, GPS systems, radio communication systems - many of these were implemented before the publically EMS system had them in place. <br>
- Electronic Medical Records (EMR) set up in spring of 2010 creating an ease of record transfer between facilities and crews, improved confidentiality, and of course &quot;going green&quot;  spin-off. The land ambulance crews uses computers on board to record data and it is them uploaded to our EMR - cloud storage which allows to access our secure records from anywhere globally.<br>
- Learning Management System (LMS) provides an educational platform for continuous training and education for employees to maintain and update their proficiency and skills with current programming and technology. Developed and provide specific programming for non-emergency transport.<br>

<br>
As a natural follow-up to the aeromedical training programs designed and implemented by Angels of Flight Canada Inc. in 1993 the company formalized its educational training and development by commencing a new division, Exodus Academy of Air Medical Studies, the forerunner of the current division, Exodus Studies. This division provided an in-house educational environment where qualified registered nurses could receive their certification for aeromedical transport, meeting the standards for this service as set by Angels of Flight Canada Inc.<br>
Today as learning trends have developed and changed over the years, Exodus Studies continues to develop and provide medical education and training programs to health care providers, physicians, registered nurses, paramedics, travelers, flight crews, flight attendants and allied professionals globally and  has expanded its educational programs to include training in workplace health and safety, travel health and safety,  non-emergency patient transfer courses as well as their aeromedical training programs.<br>
 In order to provide a 21st century learning environment, Exodus Studies have platformed their programs on their own state of the art Learning Management System, LMS. <br>
<br>

- Participate in Flight Safety Programs with Transport Canada encompassing all factors of safety in the air ambulance environment and Global Airline Safety with SCSI, California.<br>
- More than five flight nurses have been on board three of the Ministry of Health Ontario air ambulances in Ontario that were involved in air crashes in the early 1990s. This unique  introduction to emergency procedures, regulations, protocols and investigations enhanced our  understanding of government operations and investigations. <br>
- High Altitude Training, at Downsview along with Winter Wilderness Survival Adventures under the direction and supervision of Search &amp; Rescue personal from Trenton Ontario added tremendous value to our education experience and planning for not only our personal safety but that of our patient entrusted to our care.<br>
- In 2007, we organized a successful Air Medical Flight Safety Conference  held in King City, Ontario with renowned International and Federal Government speakers. Attendees included air-sea rescue helicopter physicians from as far away as Australia. This was the first conference highlighting this subject in Canada and was opened by our local Federal MP. <br>
- 2009-2011 - Moved to provide E-Learning solution for our staff orientation and continuous education.  <br>

                            Recognizing the need for highly trained nurses in this aeromedical environment, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. was incorporated by Ms. Courneyea in December 1988 offering specialized patient transportation services by both land and air and in January 1989, the first air international ambulance flight took place with two of Angels of Flight principal flight trained nurses providing the patient care.  <br>
<br>
Angels of Flight Canada gained its wings from 1988 on as the company moved forward by implementing a flight nursing program in-house for nurses flying on air ambulances as well as commercial airlines. The program advanced the training of registered nurses by teaching flight physiology and pathphysiology, preparation of patients for flight, high altitude training, in-flight safety and wilderness survival. As the foremost provider of qualified flight nurses in Ontario, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. signed its first contract to work directly with Ontario hospitals to coordinate air ambulance flights and supply flight registered nurses within the province.<br>
<br>
To meet the demands for these services, in 1991, Angels of Flight Canada Inc. opened an office at the Toronto Island Airport and operational bases were set up in Timmins, Sault St. Marie, Dryden and Sudbury to supply nurses for Ontario air ambulances in those areas. <br>

                            Ground Ambulance Transportation<br>
<br>
Beginning in 1995 and1996 with the Ontario Health Services Restructuring Commission, the landscape of Ontario&#39;s healthcare began to change. As a result of restructuring and regionalization of healthcare services, Ontario patients were often moved through the healthcare system from facility to facility for care. Patients could no longer expect to have all their healthcare needs met at a single facility. Angels of Flight Canada Inc. quickly realized that with changes being contemplated to patient ground transportation systems by the prioritization of patient transportation between Ontario healthcare facilities by defining emergent transfers or life threatening, urgent or time sensitive and non-urgent there was a need to create a non-emergent patient ground transportation service and in 1995 the Angels of Flight ground service division was created with teams of trained Paramedics and EMTs operating a ground transportation system with medically equipped trucks. At this time, our priority was to ensure the timely movement of patients to airports for International flights. As emergency medical services continued to evolve under the priority classification system utilizing public EMS units primarily for emergent or life threatening transport, the need for transportation of urgent and non-urgent patients began to grow and soon Angels of Flight Canada signed contracts to provide non-emergent patient transportation to several hospitals and Community Care Access Centres in the York and Durham regions of Ontario, roughly 4,366 square kilometers with a current service population area of 1,792,600 persons. <br>
Servicing these contracts and meeting these facilitys needs required a fleet of 10 ambulance and 2 medical support vehicles and 45 transfer staff alone, approximately the same size as many of the provincially funded EMS public ambulance services including Peterborough.  This ground transportation service also served to transport Angels of Flights air ambulance and airline clients to and from aircraft utilized by our company in the air medical patient transportation service. <br>
<br>
Value Added Experience and Knowledge of Ground Ambulance Service<br>
<br>
- Management of paramedics and support staff  including, education needs, human resources, documentation, personal needs, scheduling, etc. at a distance from the main office. <br>
- Dispatch dedicated and supervised by nurses and physicians moving patients between facilities in a timely manner and safely- interface with hospitals, physicians, and allied support providers.<br>
- Fleet management that encompassed; volume purchasing of vehicles, maintenance and service needs (only by accredited ambulance service mechanics), medical supplies, our own software vehicle maintenance tracker, GPS systems, radio communication systems - many of these were implemented before the publically EMS system had them in place. <br>
- Electronic Medical Records (EMR) set up in spring of 2010 creating an ease of record transfer between facilities and crews, improved confidentiality, and of course &quot;going green&quot;  spin-off. The land ambulance crews uses computers on board to record data and it is them uploaded to our EMR - cloud storage which allows to access our secure records from anywhere globally.<br>
- Learning Management System (LMS) provides an educational platform for continuous training and education for employees to maintain and update their proficiency and skills with current programming and technology. Developed and provide specific programming for non-emergency transport.<br>

<br>
As a natural follow-up to the aeromedical training programs designed and implemented by Angels of Flight Canada Inc. in 1993 the company formalized its educational training and development by commencing a new division, Exodus Academy of Air Medical Studies, the forerunner of the current division, Exodus Studies. This division provided an in-house educational environment where qualified registered nurses could receive their certification for aeromedical transport, meeting the standards for this service as set by Angels of Flight Canada Inc.<br>
Today as learning trends have developed and changed over the years, Exodus Studies continues to develop and provide medical education and training programs to health care providers, physicians, registered nurses, paramedics, travelers, flight crews, flight attendants and allied professionals globally and  has expanded its educational programs to include training in workplace health and safety, travel health and safety,  non-emergency patient transfer courses as well as their aeromedical training programs.<br>
 In order to provide a 21st century learning environment, Exodus Studies have platformed their programs on their own state of the art Learning Management System, LMS. <br>
<br>
 Value -Added Experience &amp; Education:<br>
- Designed air medical courses and presented them to healthcare and aviation personal in various cities in Canada and USA at colleges, hospitals and conferences.<br>
- Preceptor program (each 12 weeks) in 1990&#39;s for final year nursing students in both Colleges and Universities.  Provided an opportunity to travel with our Flight nurses caring for patients&#39; in the out-of-hospital phase of their illness/injury. <br>
- Our nurses participate in air medical flight and airline conferences &amp; training sessions throughout USA to upgrade and enhance their specialized air medical programs. Locations include Boston, Salt Lake City, Hollywood, St Louis, Kansas City, Denver (Not Available in Canada)<br>
- Participate in Flight Safety Programs with Transport Canada encompassing all factors of safety in the air ambulance environment and Global Airline Safety with SCSI, California.<br>
- More than five flight nurses have been on board three of the Ministry of Health Ontario air ambulances in Ontario that were involved in air crashes in the early 1990s. This unique  introduction to emergency procedures, regulations, protocols and investigations enhanced our  understanding of government operations and investigations. <br>
- High Altitude Training, at Downsview along with Winter Wilderness Survival Adventures under the direction and supervision of Search &amp; Rescue personal from Trenton Ontario added tremendous value to our education experience and planning for not only our personal safety but that of our patient entrusted to our care.<br>
- In 2007, we organized a successful Air Medical Flight Safety Conference  held in King City, Ontario with renowned International and Federal Government speakers. Attendees included air-sea rescue helicopter physicians from as far away as Australia. This was the first conference highlighting this subject in Canada and was opened by our local Federal MP. <br>
- 2009-2011 - Moved to provide E-Learning solution for our staff orientation and continuous education.  <br>
