        <br>            Electric Edge was founded in September, 2000 by three partners: Bryan Stevenson, Phil Bailey, and Greg Rusak (Greg was with Electric Edge until June, 2009). Each partner had many years of experience in different fields including website and web applications development, client/server software development, and database design. The partners had worked on projects of all sizes, including development of major systems for organizations such as TELUS, BC Ferry Services, Canfor, Worksafe BC, and many others.<br><br>Our company was formed when the three founders realized that by combining their diverse skills, they could provide the full spectrum of systems development services with unsurpassed quality.<br><br>In spite of forming the company in the darkest days of the dot-com collapse of 2000, our company has been profitable and has grown steadily every year. Today, the partners and staff of Electric Edge Systems Group produce top-quality websites, web applications, and software for numerous clients of all sizes.<br><br>We are often contacted by organizations with websites and applications that were produced by individuals or companies that were unable to complete the projects, or that produced poor quality results. A considerable portion of our work involves redevelopment of web, software, and database projects in order to raise them to the high standards that we are known for.<br><br>For the last several years, we have evolved into experts in fisheries management systems through our extensive work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada - Pacific Region. Major changes have taken place in fisheries management, not only in Canada, but around the world. We have been at the forefront of building systems to implement those changes for various Canadian fisheries. As a result, we are extending our reach as we promote our skills and experience to governments and fishery organizations around the world.<br><br>For more information, please contact us. <br>

                            Around the world, conservation of marine life is a growing concern. In many areas, these concerns are addressed through increased monitoring of fishing activity. One method is to monitor the offloading of catch from fishing vessels and record the quantity of each species that was caught and offloaded. Those that perform this work are referred to as &quot;dockside monitors&quot;.<br>
<br>
In fisheries that use dockside monitoring, fishing vessels are required to provide notification prior to the start of a fishing trip and again when fishing has concluded and the vessel is returning to port. These notifications are referred to as &quot;hails&quot;. At a minimum, hails provide the time and place where the vessel will be offloading its catch.<br>
<br>
In addition to providing data to regulatory and industry bodies, hails provide advance notice to dockside monitors so that they can meet the vessel upon its arrival in port and monitor the offloading of catch. The hail data can also help to ensure that vessels cannot go out fishing when certain regulatory requirements are not met.<br>
<br>
Electric Edge Systems Group has developed a complete solution for electronic hails from vessels while they are at sea.<br>

                            Electric Edge Systems Group Inc. will step you through the entire process of developing your website, web application or custom software. We&#39;ll explain everything in easy to understand terms so you can make the best possible decisions about your business, its software and data, and how to make the best use of the Internet, within your time and budgetary constraints.<br>
<br>
Web and Software Applications Development:<br>
A basic website is like an online brochure - It will provide you customers with a predetermined set of information. If you require greater interactivity with your website visitors (e.g. searching through your products, registration, logon, online purchases, automatic generation of e-mails, etc.), then you need a web application.<br>
<br>
Although many individuals and companies can produce basic websites, web and software applications development requires a far greater skill set. Our extensive experience is your assurance that your web and software applications will be done right the first time.<br>
<br>
Our successes are largely based upon our disciplined approach to the development process. This means taking the time to understand your business needs, designing your database so that it will operate with maximum efficiency and scale to your future needs, and consulting with you and obtaining your &quot;sign-off&quot; on all major milestones along the way.<br>
<br>
Database Design:<br>
For your web or client/server based applications, nothing is more important than having databases that are set-up for maximum performance, flexibility, and growth potential. Our experience in database design, data modeling, and SQL can help make sure that your databases are set-up right from the start.<br>
<br>
Analysis and Documentation:<br>
For larger projects, we can analyze and document your business processes, existing systems, and development requirements. Our experience in a wide variety of sectors helps us to identify your needs and to ask you the right questions. We can also produce full technical designs, data models, web content, and end-user manuals.<br>

                            Electric Edge Systems Group builds quality, enterprise-level systems for the management of commercial fisheries.<br>
<br>
Fisheries Management - Changing Times and Requirements<br>
Around the world, we are witnessing a fundamental shift in fishery management. Declining stocks require increased enforcement through trip, catch, and offload monitoring. Environmental concerns require drastic reductions in discarded bycatch. This is being handled through individual vessel quota that allows for retention of bycatch species and the transfer of quota between vessels.<br>
<br>
The quantity of data being tracked and the need to process and report on it quickly and effectively has never been greater. This requires new software applications, revamped databases, and new systems that are geared toward the requirements of today&#39;s fisheries.<br>
<br>
What We have been Doing<br>
For the last several years, Electric Edge Systems has worked closely with the Pacific region of Fisheries and Oceans Canada to maintain and add new functionality to existing systems and to create entirely new systems. During that time, Fisheries and Oceans Canada has implemented a wide variety of changes in various aspects of its business including trip/catch monitoring and integration of various fisheries via bycatch retention and individual transferable quota.<br>
<br>
Electric Edge has been at the forefront of implementing the many changes to Fisheries and Oceans Canada&#39;s systems. We have created or performed major work on the following systems:<br>
<br>
    * Fishery Operations System<br>
    * Quota Management System<br>
    * Scientific Licensing System<br>
    * Plant Inspections System<br>
    * National Recreational Licensing System (publically accessible)<br>
    * Regional External Party Management System<br>
<br>
Electric Edge Systems is a group of highly skilled, dedicated I.T. professionals with experience in all aspects of systems development including the following:<br>
<br>
    * Business Analysis<br>
    * Technical Design<br>
    * Data Modeling<br>
    * Database Development<br>
    * Programming of Web and Client/Server Systems<br>
    * Unit and Integrated Testing<br>
    * Documentation and User Training<br>
    * Ongoing Support and Systems Maintenance<br>
<br>
What We are Doing Now<br>
Going forward, Electric Edge Systems Group is expanding its operations. We will build upon our experience with Fisheries and Oceans Canada by providing our services and expertise to government departments and other fishery management organizations around the world. We will be seeking projects ranging from high-level consultative/advisory roles, to complete end-to-end systems planning, development, and ongoing support. We will be pleased to work independently or in partnership with organizations in the countries that they serve.<br>
<br>
Electric Edge Systems will add value to fishery management organizations as they create, adapt and improve I.T. systems to cope with the demands of today&#39;s fisheries and legislation.<br>

              </h4>
           
              BC Tel / Telus:&lt;br&gt;<br>
Designed and implemented a Corporate Intranet for <br>
the Human Resource Department of Telus. The <br>
project involved the use of several different <br>
technologies including; Microsoft Access, dBase, <br>
and Cold Fusion. This site provides corporate <br>
information to over 3000 Telus managers <br>
throughout BC and Alberta. The system was an <br>
integral part of re-structuring the company <br>
during the recent BC Tel / Telus merger. <br>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
BC Ferry Corporation (Traffic Management <br>
System):&lt;br&gt;<br>
Lead developer of the Traffic Management System <br>
(TMS). As ferry tickets for vehicles and foot <br>
passengers are purchased through PC POS, <br>
statistical information is fed into TMS. The data <br>
is displayed in real time in the traffic <br>
control tower. Tower operators use the data for <br>
tracking all traffic in the compound and for <br>
loading the traffic onto the appropriate vessels <br>
in accordance with coast guard regulations. TMS <br>
was developed in PowerBuilder 5.0 using the pfc <br>
library.<br>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
BC Ferry Corporation (Point-of-Sale System):&lt;br&gt;<br>
Co-developed PC POS - The point of sale system <br>
now in use at all BC Ferry Terminals that have <br>
ticket booths. BC Ferries transports over 25 <br>
million passengers per year with annual revenues <br>
of approximately $500 million. Over 80% of all <br>
corporate revenues are processed through PC POS. <br>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
PC POS was built using PowerBuilder with the <br>
Powersoft Foundation Class (pfc) library. PC POS <br>
is architected for continuous service at <br>
locations that may be subject to frequent network <br>
outages. Each POS device is a Windows-based PC <br>
with its own local Sybase SQL Anywhere <br>
database. Attached peripherals include an <br>
electronic cash drawer, customer display, barcode <br>
scanner and ticket printer. Each POS database <br>
communicates with an Oracle 7.3 database in the <br>
ferry terminal. The Oracle databases connect to a <br>
central Sybase System 11 database in Victoria. <br>
All inter-database communication occurs as a <br>
background process. In the event of a network <br>
outage, the databases accumulate transactions <br>
until the network is re-connected. Upon re-<br>
connection, all data is streamed to the target <br>
databases.

              Our clients say:&lt;br&gt;<br>
&quot;Electric Edge was easy to work with and laid out <br>
a clear plan of work that needed to be done and <br>
the costs involved. They were quick to respond to <br>
any concerns and corrections to be made as we <br>
proceeded through the work...we greatly <br>
appreciated their commitment&quot;&lt;br&gt;<br>

                            Around the world, conservation of marine life is a growing concern. In many areas, these concerns are addressed through increased monitoring of fishing activity. One method is to monitor the offloading of catch from fishing vessels and record the quantity of each species that was caught and offloaded. Those that perform this work are referred to as &quot;dockside monitors&quot;.<br>
<br>
In fisheries that use dockside monitoring, fishing vessels are required to provide notification prior to the start of a fishing trip and again when fishing has concluded and the vessel is returning to port. These notifications are referred to as &quot;hails&quot;. At a minimum, hails provide the time and place where the vessel will be offloading its catch.<br>
<br>
In addition to providing data to regulatory and industry bodies, hails provide advance notice to dockside monitors so that they can meet the vessel upon its arrival in port and monitor the offloading of catch. The hail data can also help to ensure that vessels cannot go out fishing when certain regulatory requirements are not met.<br>
<br>
Electric Edge Systems Group has developed a complete solution for electronic hails from vessels while they are at sea.<br>

                            Electric Edge Systems Group Inc. will step you through the entire process of developing your website, web application or custom software. We&#39;ll explain everything in easy to understand terms so you can make the best possible decisions about your business, its software and data, and how to make the best use of the Internet, within your time and budgetary constraints.<br>
<br>
Web and Software Applications Development:<br>
A basic website is like an online brochure - It will provide you customers with a predetermined set of information. If you require greater interactivity with your website visitors (e.g. searching through your products, registration, logon, online purchases, automatic generation of e-mails, etc.), then you need a web application.<br>
<br>
Although many individuals and companies can produce basic websites, web and software applications development requires a far greater skill set. Our extensive experience is your assurance that your web and software applications will be done right the first time.<br>
<br>
Our successes are largely based upon our disciplined approach to the development process. This means taking the time to understand your business needs, designing your database so that it will operate with maximum efficiency and scale to your future needs, and consulting with you and obtaining your &quot;sign-off&quot; on all major milestones along the way.<br>
<br>
Database Design:<br>
For your web or client/server based applications, nothing is more important than having databases that are set-up for maximum performance, flexibility, and growth potential. Our experience in database design, data modeling, and SQL can help make sure that your databases are set-up right from the start.<br>
<br>
Analysis and Documentation:<br>
For larger projects, we can analyze and document your business processes, existing systems, and development requirements. Our experience in a wide variety of sectors helps us to identify your needs and to ask you the right questions. We can also produce full technical designs, data models, web content, and end-user manuals.<br>

                            Electric Edge Systems Group builds quality, enterprise-level systems for the management of commercial fisheries.<br>
<br>
Fisheries Management - Changing Times and Requirements<br>
Around the world, we are witnessing a fundamental shift in fishery management. Declining stocks require increased enforcement through trip, catch, and offload monitoring. Environmental concerns require drastic reductions in discarded bycatch. This is being handled through individual vessel quota that allows for retention of bycatch species and the transfer of quota between vessels.<br>
<br>
The quantity of data being tracked and the need to process and report on it quickly and effectively has never been greater. This requires new software applications, revamped databases, and new systems that are geared toward the requirements of today&#39;s fisheries.<br>
<br>
What We have been Doing<br>
For the last several years, Electric Edge Systems has worked closely with the Pacific region of Fisheries and Oceans Canada to maintain and add new functionality to existing systems and to create entirely new systems. During that time, Fisheries and Oceans Canada has implemented a wide variety of changes in various aspects of its business including trip/catch monitoring and integration of various fisheries via bycatch retention and individual transferable quota.<br>
<br>
Electric Edge has been at the forefront of implementing the many changes to Fisheries and Oceans Canada&#39;s systems. We have created or performed major work on the following systems:<br>
<br>
    * Fishery Operations System<br>
    * Quota Management System<br>
    * Scientific Licensing System<br>
    * Plant Inspections System<br>
    * National Recreational Licensing System (publically accessible)<br>
    * Regional External Party Management System<br>
<br>
Electric Edge Systems is a group of highly skilled, dedicated I.T. professionals with experience in all aspects of systems development including the following:<br>
<br>
    * Business Analysis<br>
    * Technical Design<br>
    * Data Modeling<br>
    * Database Development<br>
    * Programming of Web and Client/Server Systems<br>
    * Unit and Integrated Testing<br>
    * Documentation and User Training<br>
    * Ongoing Support and Systems Maintenance<br>
<br>
What We are Doing Now<br>
Going forward, Electric Edge Systems Group is expanding its operations. We will build upon our experience with Fisheries and Oceans Canada by providing our services and expertise to government departments and other fishery management organizations around the world. We will be seeking projects ranging from high-level consultative/advisory roles, to complete end-to-end systems planning, development, and ongoing support. We will be pleased to work independently or in partnership with organizations in the countries that they serve.<br>
<br>
Electric Edge Systems will add value to fishery management organizations as they create, adapt and improve I.T. systems to cope with the demands of today&#39;s fisheries and legislation.<br>

                Key / Major clients:
              </h4>
           
              BC Tel / Telus:&lt;br&gt;<br>
Designed and implemented a Corporate Intranet for <br>
the Human Resource Department of Telus. The <br>
project involved the use of several different <br>
technologies including; Microsoft Access, dBase, <br>
and Cold Fusion. This site provides corporate <br>
information to over 3000 Telus managers <br>
throughout BC and Alberta. The system was an <br>
integral part of re-structuring the company <br>
during the recent BC Tel / Telus merger. <br>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
BC Ferry Corporation (Traffic Management <br>
System):&lt;br&gt;<br>
Lead developer of the Traffic Management System <br>
(TMS). As ferry tickets for vehicles and foot <br>
passengers are purchased through PC POS, <br>
statistical information is fed into TMS. The data <br>
is displayed in real time in the traffic <br>
control tower. Tower operators use the data for <br>
tracking all traffic in the compound and for <br>
loading the traffic onto the appropriate vessels <br>
in accordance with coast guard regulations. TMS <br>
was developed in PowerBuilder 5.0 using the pfc <br>
library.<br>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
BC Ferry Corporation (Point-of-Sale System):&lt;br&gt;<br>
Co-developed PC POS - The point of sale system <br>
now in use at all BC Ferry Terminals that have <br>
ticket booths. BC Ferries transports over 25 <br>
million passengers per year with annual revenues <br>
of approximately $500 million. Over 80% of all <br>
corporate revenues are processed through PC POS. <br>
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
PC POS was built using PowerBuilder with the <br>
Powersoft Foundation Class (pfc) library. PC POS <br>
is architected for continuous service at <br>
locations that may be subject to frequent network <br>
outages. Each POS device is a Windows-based PC <br>
with its own local Sybase SQL Anywhere <br>
database. Attached peripherals include an <br>
electronic cash drawer, customer display, barcode <br>
scanner and ticket printer. Each POS database <br>
communicates with an Oracle 7.3 database in the <br>
ferry terminal. The Oracle databases connect to a <br>
central Sybase System 11 database in Victoria. <br>
All inter-database communication occurs as a <br>
background process. In the event of a network <br>
outage, the databases accumulate transactions <br>
until the network is re-connected. Upon re-<br>
connection, all data is streamed to the target <br>
databases.

              Our clients say:&lt;br&gt;<br>
&quot;Electric Edge was easy to work with and laid out <br>
a clear plan of work that needed to be done and <br>
the costs involved. They were quick to respond to <br>
any concerns and corrections to be made as we <br>
proceeded through the work...we greatly <br>
appreciated their commitment&quot;&lt;br&gt;<br>
