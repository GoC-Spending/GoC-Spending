Causes for Water Damage:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Drain Backup- with the heavy rains in Toronto, the city drains cannot keep up with the flow of water that it produces. If the drains are full, there is only one place left for them to go, your basement. This can be unexpected and cause severe damage that you are unprepared for. Ensure that you have a backup valve installed to prevent this overflow of water from entering your home or property.<br>
<br>
2. Burst Pipe – Given the frigid, cold temperatures in Toronto, burst pipes are very common. In most cases this is covered by insurance, but it is still an unpleasant situation. Because pipes are overhead, water will always travel down and can affect many areas of the home. It is important to ensure that all pipes are insulated and heat is left on in cold temperatures.<br>
<br>
3. Foundation Cracks &amp; Issues – Older homes in Toronto give it the unique, historic look that we all love. However, there is a downfall to living in an older home. The foundation and structure begins to deteriorate, which can cause to water damage. If foundations are maintained properly, then there should not be an issue, but it only takes one small crack for water to start infiltrating. If you live in an older home, bring in a company that can inspect your foundation and ensure that there is proper waterproofing and no cracks.<br>
<br>
4. Damp Basements - Rolling with the older homes as mentioned above, Toronto homes are often left with dirt basements or basements that are unfinished. This can cause additional mositure issues that don&#39;t often lead to major water damages, but can lead to mold growth. Mold growth can be as damaging or more damaging as water damage. If you have an unfinished basement, seriously consider insulating and having a good vapour barrier. If you know you basement is damp, install dehumidifers to remove any excess mositure,<br>
<br>
<br>
Secondary Damage caused by Water Damage:<br>
<br>
Mold is very common when your home or property has experienced a water damage. If the water damage is not cleaned up quickly enough or not done properly, mold will grow.<br>

Fire Restoration work in Toronto and the GTA does not only depend on the damage caused by smoke and fire. Damage can also be caused from the water used to put the fire out by the fire brigade. This can lead to more damage caused that from the fire itself.<br>
<br>
Not all fire damage can be seen by then naked eye. There could be a lot more fire damage that you may not necessarily see with the naked eye. Your building could also have suffered from heat damage. For example fire could cause electrical components to melt.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is also the risk of firefighting fluids and smoke particles that have made their way into the structural materials within the building. As a result full fire damage restoration may not be fully possible until they have been removed and replaced.<br>
<br>
A Toronto or GTA-based representative from GTA Restoration will be able to meet your insurers or their loss adjusters in your home or business. They will then be able to make sure that you receive your valid claim entitlement in order to receive the cost of any corrective works that may be required.<br>

Causes for Water Damage:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Drain Backup- with the heavy rains in Toronto, the city drains cannot keep up with the flow of water that it produces. If the drains are full, there is only one place left for them to go, your basement. This can be unexpected and cause severe damage that you are unprepared for. Ensure that you have a backup valve installed to prevent this overflow of water from entering your home or property.<br>
<br>
2. Burst Pipe – Given the frigid, cold temperatures in Toronto, burst pipes are very common. In most cases this is covered by insurance, but it is still an unpleasant situation. Because pipes are overhead, water will always travel down and can affect many areas of the home. It is important to ensure that all pipes are insulated and heat is left on in cold temperatures.<br>
<br>
3. Foundation Cracks &amp; Issues – Older homes in Toronto give it the unique, historic look that we all love. However, there is a downfall to living in an older home. The foundation and structure begins to deteriorate, which can cause to water damage. If foundations are maintained properly, then there should not be an issue, but it only takes one small crack for water to start infiltrating. If you live in an older home, bring in a company that can inspect your foundation and ensure that there is proper waterproofing and no cracks.<br>
<br>
4. Damp Basements - Rolling with the older homes as mentioned above, Toronto homes are often left with dirt basements or basements that are unfinished. This can cause additional mositure issues that don&#39;t often lead to major water damages, but can lead to mold growth. Mold growth can be as damaging or more damaging as water damage. If you have an unfinished basement, seriously consider insulating and having a good vapour barrier. If you know you basement is damp, install dehumidifers to remove any excess mositure,<br>
<br>
<br>
Secondary Damage caused by Water Damage:<br>
<br>
Mold is very common when your home or property has experienced a water damage. If the water damage is not cleaned up quickly enough or not done properly, mold will grow.<br>
<br>
Water Damage Toronto is not only your water damage specialist but we are equipped to handle any mold growth that may have grown. We are trained &amp; certified by IICRC, Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration, and follow all industry guidelines in preventing and removing mold.<br>

We specialize in leak detection and thermal imaging to locate exactly where the water is coming from. We use the latest equipment to determine what areas are affected, even though it may not be visible to the eye.<br>
<br>
If you have mold growth, we will send in a certified project manager to access the mold contaminated area’s and identify what the water source is. Based on our findings, they will come up with a remediation plan to bring your home or property back to a safe living environment.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Fire Restoration work in Toronto and the GTA does not only depend on the damage caused by smoke and fire. Damage can also be caused from the water used to put the fire out by the fire brigade. This can lead to more damage caused that from the fire itself.<br>
<br>
Not all fire damage can be seen by then naked eye. There could be a lot more fire damage that you may not necessarily see with the naked eye. Your building could also have suffered from heat damage. For example fire could cause electrical components to melt.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is also the risk of firefighting fluids and smoke particles that have made their way into the structural materials within the building. As a result full fire damage restoration may not be fully possible until they have been removed and replaced.<br>
<br>
A Toronto or GTA-based representative from GTA Restoration will be able to meet your insurers or their loss adjusters in your home or business. They will then be able to make sure that you receive your valid claim entitlement in order to receive the cost of any corrective works that may be required.<br>
<br>
GTA Restoration has been an approved insurance repair network for many years and working alongside insurers and policyholders we offer fixed costs for all our restoration work for your and insurers piece of mind.<br>
<br>
With our strict standards and commitment we ensure all of our work is completed by fully qualified tradesmen based in the GTA who understand the importance of customer care. We aim to make the process of returning your home or business back to its pre loss condition in the shortest amount of time as inconvenient as possible.<br>
