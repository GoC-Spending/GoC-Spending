                            Whether you&#39;re a major manufacturer, a national retailer or a local importer of specialized products, Cole International can fulfill your full range of Canadian customs brokerage needs. With customized services backed by more than 50 years&#39; experience, we&#39;ll enhance the flow of your company&#39;s goods into Canada by minimizing costs and delays that could affect your supply chain.<br>
Cole International&#39;s Customs Consulting team is known for melding creative solutions with airtight customs compliance. Leveraging our exceptional relationships with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and our knack for working well with auditors, our style is collaborative, not antagonistic. The processes and tools we&#39;ve developed for our compliance practice are leading edge.<br>
<br>
TRADE SERVICES<br>
Unless you live and breathe customs all day long (like we do), you&#39;re not likely to understand all the complexities and intricacies of the industry…and nor should you have to. With Cole International in your corner, you&#39;ll benefit from our unparalleled expertise in the ever-changing, increasingly complex world of international trade. Think of us as your &#39;Encyclopedia of Trade Knowledge&#39;.<br>
<br>
HS Tariff Management -The world’s largest trading countries use The Harmonized System (HS) of tariff classification.  The service is offered to resident and non-resident customers.  Under this service our consultants will review a client’s existing HS tariff classification and prepare a fully researched and customs compliant database.  Tariff Relief -There are numerous relief programs that reduce or eliminate duty.  This service will identify relief opportunities either as a separate service or in conjunction with a general audit.  Furthermore we will represent clients who have unique circumstances that are not covered by existing programs.NAFTA Sourcing &amp; Record Keeping.<br>
Free Trade Agreements -When you import goods from other countries, the convoluted, multi-layered complexities of Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) can seem an overwhelming obstacle to your business. A Free Trade Agreement allows you to compete on a more level playing field with businesses in the FTA partner country. <br>
<br>
Cole is very well versed in the ins and outs of all free trade agreements and we’ll guide you smoothly through the complicated compliance process. By identifying, soliciting and verifying the countries that are now part of FTAs with Canada, we can help minimize free trade exceptions and reduce or eliminate tariffs payable on the goods you import.<br>
<br>
Canada has free trade agreements with more than 10 countries and is in negotiations with more than 60 countries, including some of the world’s key markets. It is important to note that each FTA covers different industry sectors and contains different provisions, depending on the FTA partner.<br>
<br>
True to our comprehensive, proactive, full-service approach, Cole International will:<br>
•     Update your database to ensure correct application of the Free Trade Agreement<br>
•     Maintain certificates to prevent duplication and minimize exposure<br>
•     Identify potential refunds on qualifying goods<br>
•     Provide detailed, customized reports<br>
•     Review suppliers’ certificates and seek corrective action where required<br>
<br>
Our services can provide full technical support for clients and vendors to determine eligibility, record Keeping requirements, rules of origin, origin criteria, certification requirements and related enforcement and administration concerns associated with a large variety of Free Trade Agreements.<br>
<br>
Value for Duty - Cole will compose an audit of the existing method of valuation resulting in any recommendations necessary to achieve compliance.  If the customers past valuation practice was not in compliance, we will recommend a course of action to return to compliance, to include negotiations with Canada or US Customs and any of services associated with such actions.<br>
Drawbacks - A variety of products that enter Canada or the USA are subject to a refund of duties paid based on the fact that they subsequently left Canada or the USA in the same condition they arrived in or as a component of manufactured goods.  Refunds are available retroactively for 2-4 years depending on the issue and regulation involved.<br>
General Audit Agreement - This service involves a complete audit of past import or domestic transactions to evaluate the assigned tariff classifications, duties, GST, provincial taxes and other commodity taxes.  The audit will serve to identify overpayments and minimize future disbursements and maximize compliance.<br>
International Trade Study - This study provides residents or non-residents comprehensive data related to the regulatory and trade processes for any country.  The service will identify import regulations, documentation, procedures and processes related to the client&#39;s trade requirements.<br>
<br>
CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE SERVICES<br>
The true value of customs compliance consultancy boils down to knowledge and effort – how much your consultants know…and how hard they&#39;re willing to work for you. By combining unparalleled expertise with a tireless commitment to each customer, Cole International is working hard to become the premier supplier on compliance side of the logistics landscape.<br>
<br>
Compliance Management -The environment surrounding trade activities has dramatically changed with the introduction of monetary penalties for non-compliance with customs regulations.  Our consulting services group provides an array of compliance services including compliance reviews, systems reviews, HS databases, compliance seminars and training, profile management and customer specific consultation.<br>
Voluntary Disclosures - Voluntary/Prior disclosures are used by an importer/exporter to notify the CBSA or CBP of discrepancies inherent in their trans-border transactions. By utilizing a voluntary disclosure the importer can eliminate the potential penalties that would normally apply if the discrepancies were found during an audit. These disclosures may also be made on an anonymous basis until a decision has been rendered by the CBSA or CBP.  Our service will include the review of discrepancies with the importer prior to disclosure, development of a plan of action, preparation and presentation of the actual or anonymous disclosure, review of the CBSA’s or CBP’s response and preparation/presentation of all appeals arising from the disclosure.<br>
Audit Response Unit (ARU) - Customs Audits are a very serious business and cannot be treated lightly.  Seemingly innocent requests for information are often the tip of the iceberg, leading to in-depth audits with wide-ranging scope and potential liability.  Companies trying to go it alone without full knowledge of what may happen can be drawn into undesirable scenarios with expensive results.  While some get lucky and suffer minimal impact, we are seeing quite a number of audits with the opposite result, culminating with very dramatic and costly conclusions.  In many cases this can be prevented through early Cole involvement, proper management/control and in depth experience with the audit process.<br>
<br>
The ARU is Cole’s answer to CBSA Audits. The ARU assists customers following notice from CBSA requesting information with regards to tariff, valuation, NAFTA investigations or during of a full compliance verification.  ARU will liaison directly with customs officials and help prepare documentation in response to requests.

The processes and tools we&#39;ve developed for our compliance practice are leading edge.<br>
<br>
TRADE SERVICES<br>
Unless you live and breathe customs all day long (like we do), you&#39;re not likely to understand all the complexities and intricacies of the industry…and nor should you have to. With Cole International in your corner, you&#39;ll benefit from our unparalleled expertise in the ever-changing, increasingly complex world of international trade. Think of us as your &#39;Encyclopedia of Trade Knowledge&#39;.<br>

Under this service our consultants will review a client’s existing HS tariff classification and prepare a fully researched and customs compliant database.

Furthermore we will represent clients who have unique circumstances that are not covered by existing programs.NAFTA Sourcing &amp; Record Keeping.<br>
Free Trade Agreements -When you import goods from other countries, the convoluted, multi-layered complexities of Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) can seem an overwhelming obstacle to your business. A Free Trade Agreement allows you to compete on a more level playing field with businesses in the FTA partner country. <br>
<br>
Cole is very well versed in the ins and outs of all free trade agreements and we’ll guide you smoothly through the complicated compliance process. By identifying, soliciting and verifying the countries that are now part of FTAs with Canada, we can help minimize free trade exceptions and reduce or eliminate tariffs payable on the goods you import.<br>
<br>
Canada has free trade agreements with more than 10 countries and is in negotiations with more than 60 countries, including some of the world’s key markets. It is important to note that each FTA covers different industry sectors and contains different provisions, depending on the FTA partner.<br>
<br>
True to our comprehensive, proactive, full-service approach, Cole International will:<br>
•     Update your database to ensure correct application of the Free Trade Agreement<br>
•     Maintain certificates to prevent duplication and minimize exposure<br>

If the customers past valuation practice was not in compliance, we will recommend a course of action to return to compliance, to include negotiations with Canada or US Customs and any of services associated with such actions.<br>
Drawbacks - A variety of products that enter Canada or the USA are subject to a refund of duties paid based on the fact that they subsequently left Canada or the USA in the same condition they arrived in or as a component of manufactured goods.  Refunds are available retroactively for 2-4 years depending on the issue and regulation involved.<br>

CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE SERVICES<br>

Compliance Management -The environment surrounding trade activities has dramatically changed with the introduction of monetary penalties for non-compliance with customs regulations.  Our consulting services group provides an array of compliance services including compliance reviews, systems reviews, HS databases, compliance seminars and training, profile management and customer specific consultation.<br>
Voluntary Disclosures - Voluntary/Prior disclosures are used by an importer/exporter to notify the CBSA or CBP of discrepancies inherent in their trans-border transactions. By utilizing a voluntary disclosure the importer can eliminate the potential penalties that would normally apply if the discrepancies were found during an audit. These disclosures may also be made on an anonymous basis until a decision has been rendered by the CBSA or CBP.  Our service will include the review of discrepancies with the importer prior to disclosure, development of a plan of action, preparation and presentation of the actual or anonymous disclosure, review of the CBSA’s or CBP’s response and preparation/presentation of all appeals arising from the disclosure.<br>
Audit Response Unit (ARU) - Customs Audits are a very serious business and cannot be treated lightly.  Seemingly innocent requests for information are often the tip of the iceberg, leading to in-depth audits with wide-ranging scope and potential liability.  Companies trying to go it alone without full knowledge of what may happen can be drawn into undesirable scenarios with expensive results.  While some get lucky and suffer minimal impact, we are seeing quite a number of audits with the opposite result, culminating with very dramatic and costly conclusions.  In many cases this can be prevented through early Cole involvement, proper management/control and in depth experience with the audit process.<br>
<br>
The ARU is Cole’s answer to CBSA Audits. The ARU assists customers following notice from CBSA requesting information with regards to tariff, valuation, NAFTA investigations or during of a full compliance verification.

Under this service our consultants will review a client’s existing HS tariff classification and prepare a fully researched and customs compliant database.

Furthermore we will represent clients who have unique circumstances that are not covered by existing programs.NAFTA Sourcing &amp; Record Keeping.<br>
Free Trade Agreements -When you import goods from other countries, the convoluted, multi-layered complexities of Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) can seem an overwhelming obstacle to your business. A Free Trade Agreement allows you to compete on a more level playing field with businesses in the FTA partner country. <br>
<br>
Cole is very well versed in the ins and outs of all free trade agreements and we’ll guide you smoothly through the complicated compliance process. By identifying, soliciting and verifying the countries that are now part of FTAs with Canada, we can help minimize free trade exceptions and reduce or eliminate tariffs payable on the goods you import.<br>
<br>
Canada has free trade agreements with more than 10 countries and is in negotiations with more than 60 countries, including some of the world’s key markets. It is important to note that each FTA covers different industry sectors and contains different provisions, depending on the FTA partner.<br>
<br>
True to our comprehensive, proactive, full-service approach, Cole International will:<br>
•     Update your database to ensure correct application of the Free Trade Agreement<br>
•     Maintain certificates to prevent duplication and minimize exposure<br>
•     Identify potential refunds on qualifying goods<br>
•     Provide detailed, customized reports<br>
•     Review suppliers’ certificates and seek corrective action where required<br>
<br>
Our services can provide full technical support for clients and vendors to determine eligibility, record Keeping requirements, rules of origin, origin criteria, certification requirements and related enforcement and administration concerns associated with a large variety of Free Trade Agreements.<br>
<br>
Value for Duty - Cole will compose an audit of the existing method of valuation resulting in any recommendations necessary to achieve compliance.  If the customers past valuation practice was not in compliance, we will recommend a course of action to return to compliance, to include negotiations with Canada or US Customs and any of services associated with such actions.<br>
Drawbacks - A variety of products that enter Canada or the USA are subject to a refund of duties paid based on the fact that they subsequently left Canada or the USA in the same condition they arrived in or as a component of manufactured goods.  Refunds are available retroactively for 2-4 years depending on the issue and regulation involved.<br>
General Audit Agreement - This service involves a complete audit of past import or domestic transactions to evaluate the assigned tariff classifications, duties, GST, provincial taxes and other commodity taxes.  The audit will serve to identify overpayments and minimize future disbursements and maximize compliance.<br>

CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE SERVICES<br>
The true value of customs compliance consultancy boils down to knowledge and effort – how much your consultants know…and how hard they&#39;re willing to work for you. By combining unparalleled expertise with a tireless commitment to each customer, Cole International is working hard to become the premier supplier on compliance side of the logistics landscape.<br>
<br>
Compliance Management -The environment surrounding trade activities has dramatically changed with the introduction of monetary penalties for non-compliance with customs regulations.  Our consulting services group provides an array of compliance services including compliance reviews, systems reviews, HS databases, compliance seminars and training, profile management and customer specific consultation.<br>
Voluntary Disclosures - Voluntary/Prior disclosures are used by an importer/exporter to notify the CBSA or CBP of discrepancies inherent in their trans-border transactions. By utilizing a voluntary disclosure the importer can eliminate the potential penalties that would normally apply if the discrepancies were found during an audit. These disclosures may also be made on an anonymous basis until a decision has been rendered by the CBSA or CBP.  Our service will include the review of discrepancies with the importer prior to disclosure, development of a plan of action, preparation and presentation of the actual or anonymous disclosure, review of the CBSA’s or CBP’s response and preparation/presentation of all appeals arising from the disclosure.<br>
Audit Response Unit (ARU) - Customs Audits are a very serious business and cannot be treated lightly.  Seemingly innocent requests for information are often the tip of the iceberg, leading to in-depth audits with wide-ranging scope and potential liability.  Companies trying to go it alone without full knowledge of what may happen can be drawn into undesirable scenarios with expensive results.  While some get lucky and suffer minimal impact, we are seeing quite a number of audits with the opposite result, culminating with very dramatic and costly conclusions.  In many cases this can be prevented through early Cole involvement, proper management/control and in depth experience with the audit process.<br>
<br>
The ARU is Cole’s answer to CBSA Audits. The ARU assists customers following notice from CBSA requesting information with regards to tariff, valuation, NAFTA investigations or during of a full compliance verification.  ARU will liaison directly with customs officials and help prepare documentation in response to requests. ARU will draw upon their extensive knowledge of customs regulations and practices to resolve outstanding issues and to help customers avoid potential penalty assessments. <br>
<br>
Our team of industry professionals will help to interpret Customs letters, challenge decisions and ensure that you are represented by an experienced team that will act in your best interest to minimize exposure to penalties, monitor changing policies, both regionally and nationally, confirm and insure uniform application of any precedents set in various regions across the country, interpret both the interim and final audit reports to help identify and determine if any changes are required to your business practices and ensure that you are represented fairly when working with Customs officials. <br>
Penalty Reduction Agreements (PRAs) - US and Canadian customs can allow companies to enter into PRA’s following the assessment of penalties relating to import compliance.  We will assist the client by reviewing the penalties assessed, Provide advice on the best course of action and if required negotiate on the client’s behalf the terms of the PRA with either CBP or CBSA.<br>
Penalty Mitigation - A variety of penalties can be applied for infractions incurred by importers.  Each recurrent penalty increases the monetary amount of the next infraction. It is crucial that all penalties regardless of size or level be appealed to insure future compliance costs are kept to a minimum.  Your import profile reflects the amount of customs enforcement you will receive and determines the frequency of customs audits.  Our service focuses on the reduction or removal of penalties from your import record. <br>
<br>
Cole will attempt to reverse the impact of enforcement action and provide advice on future compliance requirements, including appeals directly to the assessing officer, the Adjudications Directorate of the Canada Border Service Agency, Customs Border Protection or higher when necessary and warranted.<br>
Seizure Appeals - Seizures and ascertained forfeiture occur when goods have not been reported or were undervalued for Customs purposes.  We will represent the client in such enforcement action, prepare any required appeals and provide advice on future conformance.<br>
<br>
BORDER SECURITY<br>
Cole International&#39;s consultants will help you navigate and negotiate the ever-changing, ever more complex border security issues that have become the norm since 9/11.<br>
<br>
C-TPAT (Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) - is a joint US Customs-business initiative to build cooperative relationships that strengthen overall supply chain and border security. Through this initiative, Customs is asking businesses to ensure the integrity of their security practices and communicate their security guidelines to their business partners within the supply chain.<br>
<br>
Our service entails all aspects of the C-TPAT application and acceptance process including preparation and submission of the Memorandum of Understanding and preparation and submission of the supply chain security profile questionnaire to Customs.<br>
<br>
Cole conducts a comprehensive self-assessment of supply chain security using the C-TPAT security guidelines jointly developed by Customs and the trade community. These guidelines encompass areas of Procedural Security, Physical Security, Personnel Security, Education and Training, Access Controls, Manifest Procedures, and Conveyance Security. <br>
<br>
We can help you to develop and implement a program to enhance security throughout the supply chain in accordance with C-TPAT guidelines and communicate C-TPAT guidelines to other companies in your supply chain.<br>
PIP (Partners in Protection) - is a joint Canada Customs-business initiative to build cooperative relationships that strengthen overall supply chain and border security. Through this initiative, Customs is asking businesses to ensure the integrity of their security practices and communicate their security guidelines to their business partners within the supply chain.  Services for this program are the same as those offered under our C-TPAT program noted above.<br>
Security Maintenance Program - This program focuses on the yearly maintenance aspects of being a member of C-TPAT or PIP.  Annually vendors are polled to identify their ongoing commitment to security.  Security profile updates and changes to security policy, process must be voluntarily submitted to Canada or US Customs or both.  Failure to update your files correctly can result in the loss qualification status.  Annual monitoring and self-assessment is a critical part of maintaining your existing security status.  This service proactively manages the monthly or yearly maintenance requirements for both security programs.<br>

                            For large jobs that require the coordinated transport and customs clearance of over-dimensional, overweight and high-value project cargo – those moves that usually combine complex logistical challenges with project-critical timelines – Cole International’s Project Logistics team has the know-how and experience to get the job done…on time, on budget, anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
For Canadian and U.S. clients in energy, mining, manufacturing, aerospace, oil and gas, and countless other industries, Cole International delivers highly personalized Project Logistics Management services, deftly executing a full range of transportation, customs brokerage and customs compliance requirements.<br>
Cole International has been in the logistics business for over half a century – your assurance that you’ll be getting professional guidance, comprehensive regulatory knowledge and reliable logistics services that are second to none. During that time, we’ve developed deep understandings of what it takes to make complex project logistics look easy:<br>
<br>
As every project is unique, every logistics strategy demands a fully customized, hands-on approach<br>
<br>
Planning and managing these complex cargo shipments requires the flexibility, creativity and insight that come only with experience<br>
<br>
Success depends on skilful coordination of many moving parts, careful oversight and proactive troubleshooting by people who’ve seen – and successfully dealt with – every conceivable logistics issue<br>
<br>
Typically occurring apart from a company’s normal business activities, these specialized shipments have high visibility and impact – two factors that point to one simple truth: failure is not an option.<br>

Free Trade Agreements -When you import goods from other countries, the convoluted, multi-layered complexities of Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) can seem an overwhelming obstacle to your business. A Free Trade Agreement allows you to compete on a more level playing field with businesses in the FTA partner country. <br>
<br>
Cole is very well versed in the ins and outs of all free trade agreements and we’ll guide you smoothly through the complicated compliance process. By identifying, soliciting and verifying the countries that are now part of FTAs with Canada, we can help minimize free trade exceptions and reduce or eliminate tariffs payable on the goods you import.<br>
<br>
Canada has free trade agreements with more than 10 countries and is in negotiations with more than 60 countries, including some of the world’s key markets. It is important to note that each FTA covers different industry sectors and contains different provisions, depending on the FTA partner.<br>
<br>

Drawbacks - A variety of products that enter Canada or the USA are subject to a refund of duties paid based on the fact that they subsequently left Canada or the USA in the same condition they arrived in or as a component of manufactured goods.  Refunds are available retroactively for 2-4 years depending on the issue and regulation involved.<br>

CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE SERVICES<br>

By combining unparalleled expertise with a tireless commitment to each customer, Cole International is working hard to become the premier supplier on compliance side of the logistics landscape.<br>
<br>
Compliance Management -The environment surrounding trade activities has dramatically changed with the introduction of monetary penalties for non-compliance with customs regulations.  Our consulting services group provides an array of compliance services including compliance reviews, systems reviews, HS databases, compliance seminars and training, profile management and customer specific consultation.<br>
Voluntary Disclosures - Voluntary/Prior disclosures are used by an importer/exporter to notify the CBSA or CBP of discrepancies inherent in their trans-border transactions. By utilizing a voluntary disclosure the importer can eliminate the potential penalties that would normally apply if the discrepancies were found during an audit. These disclosures may also be made on an anonymous basis until a decision has been rendered by the CBSA or CBP.  Our service will include the review of discrepancies with the importer prior to disclosure, development of a plan of action, preparation and presentation of the actual or anonymous disclosure, review of the CBSA’s or CBP’s response and preparation/presentation of all appeals arising from the disclosure.<br>
Audit Response Unit (ARU) - Customs Audits are a very serious business and cannot be treated lightly.  Seemingly innocent requests for information are often the tip of the iceberg, leading to in-depth audits with wide-ranging scope and potential liability.  Companies trying to go it alone without full knowledge of what may happen can be drawn into undesirable scenarios with expensive results.  While some get lucky and suffer minimal impact, we are seeing quite a number of audits with the opposite result, culminating with very dramatic and costly conclusions.  In many cases this can be prevented through early Cole involvement, proper management/control and in depth experience with the audit process.<br>
<br>
The ARU is Cole’s answer to CBSA Audits. The ARU assists customers following notice from CBSA requesting information with regards to tariff, valuation, NAFTA investigations or during of a full compliance verification.

Penalty Reduction Agreements (PRAs) - US and Canadian customs can allow companies to enter into PRA’s following the assessment of penalties relating to import compliance.  We will assist the client by reviewing the penalties assessed, Provide advice on the best course of action and if required negotiate on the client’s behalf the terms of the PRA with either CBP or CBSA.<br>
Penalty Mitigation - A variety of penalties can be applied for infractions incurred by importers.  Each recurrent penalty increases the monetary amount of the next infraction. It is crucial that all penalties regardless of size or level be appealed to insure future compliance costs are kept to a minimum.  Your import profile reflects the amount of customs enforcement you will receive and determines the frequency of customs audits.  Our service focuses on the reduction or removal of penalties from your import record. <br>
<br>
Cole will attempt to reverse the impact of enforcement action and provide advice on future compliance requirements, including appeals directly to the assessing officer, the Adjudications Directorate of the Canada Border Service Agency, Customs Border Protection or higher when necessary and warranted.<br>

Free Trade Agreements -When you import goods from other countries, the convoluted, multi-layered complexities of Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) can seem an overwhelming obstacle to your business.

Cole is very well versed in the ins and outs of all free trade agreements and we’ll guide you smoothly through the complicated compliance process. By identifying, soliciting and verifying the countries that are now part of FTAs with Canada, we can help minimize free trade exceptions and reduce or eliminate tariffs payable on the goods you import.<br>
<br>
Canada has free trade agreements with more than 10 countries and is in negotiations with more than 60 countries, including some of the world’s key markets. It is important to note that each FTA covers different industry sectors and contains different provisions, depending on the FTA partner.<br>

CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE SERVICES<br>

Compliance Management -The environment surrounding trade activities has dramatically changed with the introduction of monetary penalties for non-compliance with customs regulations.  Our consulting services group provides an array of compliance services including compliance reviews, systems reviews, HS databases, compliance seminars and training, profile management and customer specific consultation.<br>
Voluntary Disclosures - Voluntary/Prior disclosures are used by an importer/exporter to notify the CBSA or CBP of discrepancies inherent in their trans-border transactions. By utilizing a voluntary disclosure the importer can eliminate the potential penalties that would normally apply if the discrepancies were found during an audit. These disclosures may also be made on an anonymous basis until a decision has been rendered by the CBSA or CBP.  Our service will include the review of discrepancies with the importer prior to disclosure, development of a plan of action, preparation and presentation of the actual or anonymous disclosure, review of the CBSA’s or CBP’s response and preparation/presentation of all appeals arising from the disclosure.<br>
Audit Response Unit (ARU) - Customs Audits are a very serious business and cannot be treated lightly.  Seemingly innocent requests for information are often the tip of the iceberg, leading to in-depth audits with wide-ranging scope and potential liability.  Companies trying to go it alone without full knowledge of what may happen can be drawn into undesirable scenarios with expensive results.  While some get lucky and suffer minimal impact, we are seeing quite a number of audits with the opposite result, culminating with very dramatic and costly conclusions.  In many cases this can be prevented through early Cole involvement, proper management/control and in depth experience with the audit process.<br>
<br>
The ARU is Cole’s answer to CBSA Audits. The ARU assists customers following notice from CBSA requesting information with regards to tariff, valuation, NAFTA investigations or during of a full compliance verification.  ARU will liaison directly with customs officials and help prepare documentation in response to requests. ARU will draw upon their extensive knowledge of customs regulations and practices to resolve outstanding issues and to help customers avoid potential penalty assessments. <br>

Penalty Reduction Agreements (PRAs) - US and Canadian customs can allow companies to enter into PRA’s following the assessment of penalties relating to import compliance.  We will assist the client by reviewing the penalties assessed, Provide advice on the best course of action and if required negotiate on the client’s behalf the terms of the PRA with either CBP or CBSA.<br>
Penalty Mitigation - A variety of penalties can be applied for infractions incurred by importers.  Each recurrent penalty increases the monetary amount of the next infraction. It is crucial that all penalties regardless of size or level be appealed to insure future compliance costs are kept to a minimum.  Your import profile reflects the amount of customs enforcement you will receive and determines the frequency of customs audits.  Our service focuses on the reduction or removal of penalties from your import record. <br>
<br>
Cole will attempt to reverse the impact of enforcement action and provide advice on future compliance requirements, including appeals directly to the assessing officer, the Adjudications Directorate of the Canada Border Service Agency, Customs Border Protection or higher when necessary and warranted.<br>
Seizure Appeals - Seizures and ascertained forfeiture occur when goods have not been reported or were undervalued for Customs purposes.  We will represent the client in such enforcement action, prepare any required appeals and provide advice on future conformance.<br>

With customized services backed by more than 50 years&#39; experience, we&#39;ll enhance the flow of your company&#39;s goods into Canada by minimizing costs and delays that could affect your supply chain.<br>
Cole International&#39;s Customs Consulting team is known for melding creative solutions with airtight customs compliance. Leveraging our exceptional relationships with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and our knack for working well with auditors, our style is collaborative, not antagonistic. The processes and tools we&#39;ve developed for our compliance practice are leading edge.<br>
<br>
TRADE SERVICES<br>
Unless you live and breathe customs all day long (like we do), you&#39;re not likely to understand all the complexities and intricacies of the industry…and nor should you have to. With Cole International in your corner, you&#39;ll benefit from our unparalleled expertise in the ever-changing, increasingly complex world of international trade. Think of us as your &#39;Encyclopedia of Trade Knowledge&#39;.<br>
<br>
HS Tariff Management -The world’s largest trading countries use The Harmonized System (HS) of tariff classification.  The service is offered to resident and non-resident customers.  Under this service our consultants will review a client’s existing HS tariff classification and prepare a fully researched and customs compliant database.  Tariff Relief -There are numerous relief programs that reduce or eliminate duty.  This service will identify relief opportunities either as a separate service or in conjunction with a general audit.  Furthermore we will represent clients who have unique circumstances that are not covered by existing programs.NAFTA Sourcing &amp; Record Keeping.<br>
Free Trade Agreements -When you import goods from other countries, the convoluted, multi-layered complexities of Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) can seem an overwhelming obstacle to your business. A Free Trade Agreement allows you to compete on a more level playing field with businesses in the FTA partner country. <br>
<br>
Cole is very well versed in the ins and outs of all free trade agreements and we’ll guide you smoothly through the complicated compliance process. By identifying, soliciting and verifying the countries that are now part of FTAs with Canada, we can help minimize free trade exceptions and reduce or eliminate tariffs payable on the goods you import.<br>
<br>
Canada has free trade agreements with more than 10 countries and is in negotiations with more than 60 countries, including some of the world’s key markets. It is important to note that each FTA covers different industry sectors and contains different provisions, depending on the FTA partner.<br>
<br>
True to our comprehensive, proactive, full-service approach, Cole International will:<br>
•     Update your database to ensure correct application of the Free Trade Agreement<br>
•     Maintain certificates to prevent duplication and minimize exposure<br>
•     Identify potential refunds on qualifying goods<br>
•     Provide detailed, customized reports<br>
•     Review suppliers’ certificates and seek corrective action where required<br>
<br>
Our services can provide full technical support for clients and vendors to determine eligibility, record Keeping requirements, rules of origin, origin criteria, certification requirements and related enforcement and administration concerns associated with a large variety of Free Trade Agreements.<br>
<br>
Value for Duty - Cole will compose an audit of the existing method of valuation resulting in any recommendations necessary to achieve compliance.  If the customers past valuation practice was not in compliance, we will recommend a course of action to return to compliance, to include negotiations with Canada or US Customs and any of services associated with such actions.<br>
Drawbacks - A variety of products that enter Canada or the USA are subject to a refund of duties paid based on the fact that they subsequently left Canada or the USA in the same condition they arrived in or as a component of manufactured goods.  Refunds are available retroactively for 2-4 years depending on the issue and regulation involved.<br>
General Audit Agreement - This service involves a complete audit of past import or domestic transactions to evaluate the assigned tariff classifications, duties, GST, provincial taxes and other commodity taxes.  The audit will serve to identify overpayments and minimize future disbursements and maximize compliance.<br>
International Trade Study - This study provides residents or non-residents comprehensive data related to the regulatory and trade processes for any country.  The service will identify import regulations, documentation, procedures and processes related to the client&#39;s trade requirements.<br>
<br>
CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE SERVICES<br>
The true value of customs compliance consultancy boils down to knowledge and effort – how much your consultants know…and how hard they&#39;re willing to work for you. By combining unparalleled expertise with a tireless commitment to each customer, Cole International is working hard to become the premier supplier on compliance side of the logistics landscape.<br>
<br>
Compliance Management -The environment surrounding trade activities has dramatically changed with the introduction of monetary penalties for non-compliance with customs regulations.  Our consulting services group provides an array of compliance services including compliance reviews, systems reviews, HS databases, compliance seminars and training, profile management and customer specific consultation.<br>
Voluntary Disclosures - Voluntary/Prior disclosures are used by an importer/exporter to notify the CBSA or CBP of discrepancies inherent in their trans-border transactions. By utilizing a voluntary disclosure the importer can eliminate the potential penalties that would normally apply if the discrepancies were found during an audit. These disclosures may also be made on an anonymous basis until a decision has been rendered by the CBSA or CBP.  Our service will include the review of discrepancies with the importer prior to disclosure, development of a plan of action, preparation and presentation of the actual or anonymous disclosure, review of the CBSA’s or CBP’s response and preparation/presentation of all appeals arising from the disclosure.<br>
Audit Response Unit (ARU) - Customs Audits are a very serious business and cannot be treated lightly.  Seemingly innocent requests for information are often the tip of the iceberg, leading to in-depth audits with wide-ranging scope and potential liability.  Companies trying to go it alone without full knowledge of what may happen can be drawn into undesirable scenarios with expensive results.  While some get lucky and suffer minimal impact, we are seeing quite a number of audits with the opposite result, culminating with very dramatic and costly conclusions.  In many cases this can be prevented through early Cole involvement, proper management/control and in depth experience with the audit process.<br>
<br>
The ARU is Cole’s answer to CBSA Audits. The ARU assists customers following notice from CBSA requesting information with regards to tariff, valuation, NAFTA investigations or during of a full compliance verification.  ARU will liaison directly with customs officials and help prepare documentation in response to requests. ARU will draw upon their extensive knowledge of customs regulations and practices to resolve outstanding issues and to help customers avoid potential penalty assessments. <br>
<br>
Our team of industry professionals will help to interpret Customs letters, challenge decisions and ensure that you are represented by an experienced team that will act in your best interest to minimize exposure to penalties, monitor changing policies, both regionally and nationally, confirm and insure uniform application of any precedents set in various regions across the country, interpret both the interim and final audit reports to help identify and determine if any changes are required to your business practices and ensure that you are represented fairly when working with Customs officials. <br>
Penalty Reduction Agreements (PRAs) - US and Canadian customs can allow companies to enter into PRA’s following the assessment of penalties relating to import compliance.  We will assist the client by reviewing the penalties assessed, Provide advice on the best course of action and if required negotiate on the client’s behalf the terms of the PRA with either CBP or CBSA.<br>
Penalty Mitigation - A variety of penalties can be applied for infractions incurred by importers.  Each recurrent penalty increases the monetary amount of the next infraction. It is crucial that all penalties regardless of size or level be appealed to insure future compliance costs are kept to a minimum.  Your import profile reflects the amount of customs enforcement you will receive and determines the frequency of customs audits.  Our service focuses on the reduction or removal of penalties from your import record. <br>
<br>
Cole will attempt to reverse the impact of enforcement action and provide advice on future compliance requirements, including appeals directly to the assessing officer, the Adjudications Directorate of the Canada Border Service Agency, Customs Border Protection or higher when necessary and warranted.<br>
Seizure Appeals - Seizures and ascertained forfeiture occur when goods have not been reported or were undervalued for Customs purposes.  We will represent the client in such enforcement action, prepare any required appeals and provide advice on future conformance.<br>
<br>
BORDER SECURITY<br>
Cole International&#39;s consultants will help you navigate and negotiate the ever-changing, ever more complex border security issues that have become the norm since 9/11.<br>
<br>
C-TPAT (Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) - is a joint US Customs-business initiative to build cooperative relationships that strengthen overall supply chain and border security. Through this initiative, Customs is asking businesses to ensure the integrity of their security practices and communicate their security guidelines to their business partners within the supply chain.<br>
<br>
Our service entails all aspects of the C-TPAT application and acceptance process including preparation and submission of the Memorandum of Understanding and preparation and submission of the supply chain security profile questionnaire to Customs.<br>
<br>
Cole conducts a comprehensive self-assessment of supply chain security using the C-TPAT security guidelines jointly developed by Customs and the trade community. These guidelines encompass areas of Procedural Security, Physical Security, Personnel Security, Education and Training, Access Controls, Manifest Procedures, and Conveyance Security. <br>
<br>
We can help you to develop and implement a program to enhance security throughout the supply chain in accordance with C-TPAT guidelines and communicate C-TPAT guidelines to other companies in your supply chain.<br>
PIP (Partners in Protection) - is a joint Canada Customs-business initiative to build cooperative relationships that strengthen overall supply chain and border security. Through this initiative, Customs is asking businesses to ensure the integrity of their security practices and communicate their security guidelines to their business partners within the supply chain.  Services for this program are the same as those offered under our C-TPAT program noted above.<br>
Security Maintenance Program - This program focuses on the yearly maintenance aspects of being a member of C-TPAT or PIP.  Annually vendors are polled to identify their ongoing commitment to security.  Security profile updates and changes to security policy, process must be voluntarily submitted to Canada or US Customs or both.  Failure to update your files correctly can result in the loss qualification status.  Annual monitoring and self-assessment is a critical part of maintaining your existing security status.  This service proactively manages the monthly or yearly maintenance requirements for both security programs.<br>

Cole International&#39;s Commodity Tax &amp; Compliance group will help you navigate this complicated environment.

                            For large jobs that require the coordinated transport and customs clearance of over-dimensional, overweight and high-value project cargo – those moves that usually combine complex logistical challenges with project-critical timelines – Cole International’s Project Logistics team has the know-how and experience to get the job done…on time, on budget, anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
For Canadian and U.S. clients in energy, mining, manufacturing, aerospace, oil and gas, and countless other industries, Cole International delivers highly personalized Project Logistics Management services, deftly executing a full range of transportation, customs brokerage and customs compliance requirements.<br>
Cole International has been in the logistics business for over half a century – your assurance that you’ll be getting professional guidance, comprehensive regulatory knowledge and reliable logistics services that are second to none. During that time, we’ve developed deep understandings of what it takes to make complex project logistics look easy:<br>
<br>
As every project is unique, every logistics strategy demands a fully customized, hands-on approach<br>
<br>
Planning and managing these complex cargo shipments requires the flexibility, creativity and insight that come only with experience<br>
<br>
Success depends on skilful coordination of many moving parts, careful oversight and proactive troubleshooting by people who’ve seen – and successfully dealt with – every conceivable logistics issue<br>
<br>
Typically occurring apart from a company’s normal business activities, these specialized shipments have high visibility and impact – two factors that point to one simple truth: failure is not an option.<br>
