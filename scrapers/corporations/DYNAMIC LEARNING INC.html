                            Clear writing is critical for managers and professionals. Communications with clients, colleagues, tax authorities and other professionals must accurately and precisely convey the required information. Poor writing leads to miscommunications. Sloppy sentences can be misconstrued. Emails and remails seeking clarification waste the time of the writer and the reader.<br>
<br>
This course will show you how to use plain English to avoid ambiguity. You will increase the quality of your writing while decreasing the time you spend writing. You will learn how to prepare your thoughts and how to compose them so the reader will understand you perfectly. <br>
<br>
Your work is complicated  your writing shouldnt be. <br>

                            If you are like most people, you read more slowly than you can think. Since a piece of writing is actually slowing down your thought process, you will tend to be easily distracted, to get bored, and worst of all, to get drowsy and even fall asleep when you are reading.  <br>
<br>
At work, people are very knowledgeable about the content of their professional material, so they can read it a lot faster than they think they can.  This seminar will show you how to read much faster and how to remember the key points from what you read.<br>

                            The ability to write an informative and engaging report or proposal is an essential and specialized skill.  In this session, participants come with a report or proposal they need to write, and by the end of the session, they have a plan and a draft of at least one of the sections.  The report or proposal may be one that has already been started or one that is merely on the drawing board.  It can even be one that has been finished already, in which case it can be reviewed and evaluated with a fresh eye.  <br>

                            In January 2013, the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), part of Health Canada, officially released Canada&#39;s first national standard designed to help organizations and their employees improve workplace psychological health and safety.<br>
The National Standard of Canada titled Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace - is a voluntary standard focused on promoting employees&#39; psychological health and preventing psychological harm due to workplace factors.  <br>
Mental illness has been calculated to cost the Canadian economy $51 billion annually and is a contributing factor for over 40% long-term disability claims. One in five people in Canada are likely to have at least one episode in their lifetime, most often between the ages of 18 and 65.<br>

                            Readers are busy people. When they are kind enough to begin reading our words, they also begin thinking about doing something else. Alerts are flashing across the screen, links tempt them away, and Facebook tells them someone has commented on their photo. <br>
<br>
Writers always knew some readers would abandon them before finishing their piece, but now we know exactly how long readers spend on our pages, what holds their attention, and when they leave. <br>
We can improve our writing to retain readers. Online readers like short sentences, short paragraphs, and lots of white space. <br>
1.	79% of users always scan; only 16% read word-by-word. <br>
2.	Reading from computer screens is 25% slower than from paper.<br>
Internet content should be 50% less words than its paper equivalent.<br>

                            The disembodied world of e-communications is fraught with potential miscommunications. <br>
Its all too easy to thumb off a quick message on your smartphone that unknowingly offends the recipient with a blunt message. Its also easy to write flowery language around the key issue for so long that you lose your audience before you get your message across. <br>
Learn how to strike the right tone in e-mails so that your recipient cannot possibly misunderstand, and gives you what you want. <br>

                            For 2500 years, Sun Tzus Art of War has been a guide to leaders who want to achieve success without getting bogged down in further conflictto attain victory without fighting.  It teaches a way of being that helps you lead effectively in a world of complexity and chaos.  You can develop a way of knowing yourself, knowing others and knowing the things that make up your world.  Then you can help arrange them so their configuration of power brings about a victory that leaves both sides stronger.<br>
The Rules of Victory demonstrates how the skillful actions from this famous strategy manual can apply to you and your life.  The Art of War is not about an ancient approach from a foreign culture.  Rather it presents inherent human wisdom about a way of viewing and being in the world that gives rise to skillful action.<br>

                            High achievers set high standards for themselves and work energetically to achieve excellence, but their whole sense of self-worth is not dragged down if they dont meet those standards perfectly<br>
<br>
People who are perfectionistic have unrealistically high expectations for their performance, but take little joy in their accomplishments because their results are never quite good enough. This means that sometimes they avoid taking on certain challenges because they fear that they cant do them perfectly. Unlike high achievers who enjoy the flow of marshaling their strongest skills, stretching towards a challenge, and doing the best they can with the time and energy they have, perfectionists focus only on the goal and find the hard work and long hours exhausting and the results imperfect.<br>
<br>
If you suspect that you may be a perfectionist or you live or work with a perfectionist, taking this course will decrease your stress and increase your enjoyment of your work and your life.<br>

                            Clear writing is critical for managers and professionals. Communications with clients, colleagues, tax authorities and other professionals must accurately and precisely convey the required information. Poor writing leads to miscommunications. Sloppy sentences can be misconstrued. Emails and remails seeking clarification waste the time of the writer and the reader.<br>
<br>
This course will show you how to use plain English to avoid ambiguity. You will increase the quality of your writing while decreasing the time you spend writing. You will learn how to prepare your thoughts and how to compose them so the reader will understand you perfectly. <br>
<br>
Your work is complicated  your writing shouldnt be. <br>

                            If you are like most people, you read more slowly than you can think. Since a piece of writing is actually slowing down your thought process, you will tend to be easily distracted, to get bored, and worst of all, to get drowsy and even fall asleep when you are reading.  <br>
<br>
At work, people are very knowledgeable about the content of their professional material, so they can read it a lot faster than they think they can.  This seminar will show you how to read much faster and how to remember the key points from what you read.<br>

                            In todays busy work and home environment, most of us unwittingly block access to the most powerful areas of our memory. We overload it, stress it, and bore it  when we could be doing the opposite. Techniques taught in this workshop have stood the test of thousands of years of human practice.<br>
<br>
With this course, you can not only learn how to work with your memory more effectively now, but you can develop strategies to prevent memory loss and keep your brain young. Many of the techniques taught in this workshop have stood the test of thousands of years of human practice. Plus you can understand the latest research on how food, medicines, exercise, stress, and other lifestyle choices directly affect your most valuable asset  your brain.<br>

                            The ability to write an informative and engaging report or proposal is an essential and specialized skill.  In this session, participants come with a report or proposal they need to write, and by the end of the session, they have a plan and a draft of at least one of the sections.  The report or proposal may be one that has already been started or one that is merely on the drawing board.  It can even be one that has been finished already, in which case it can be reviewed and evaluated with a fresh eye.  <br>

                            In January 2013, the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), part of Health Canada, officially released Canada&#39;s first national standard designed to help organizations and their employees improve workplace psychological health and safety.<br>
The National Standard of Canada titled Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace - is a voluntary standard focused on promoting employees&#39; psychological health and preventing psychological harm due to workplace factors.  <br>
Mental illness has been calculated to cost the Canadian economy $51 billion annually and is a contributing factor for over 40% long-term disability claims. One in five people in Canada are likely to have at least one episode in their lifetime, most often between the ages of 18 and 65.<br>

                            Readers are busy people. When they are kind enough to begin reading our words, they also begin thinking about doing something else. Alerts are flashing across the screen, links tempt them away, and Facebook tells them someone has commented on their photo. <br>
<br>
Writers always knew some readers would abandon them before finishing their piece, but now we know exactly how long readers spend on our pages, what holds their attention, and when they leave. <br>
We can improve our writing to retain readers. Online readers like short sentences, short paragraphs, and lots of white space. <br>
1.	79% of users always scan; only 16% read word-by-word. <br>
2.	Reading from computer screens is 25% slower than from paper.<br>
Internet content should be 50% less words than its paper equivalent.<br>

                            The disembodied world of e-communications is fraught with potential miscommunications. <br>
Its all too easy to thumb off a quick message on your smartphone that unknowingly offends the recipient with a blunt message. Its also easy to write flowery language around the key issue for so long that you lose your audience before you get your message across. <br>
Learn how to strike the right tone in e-mails so that your recipient cannot possibly misunderstand, and gives you what you want. <br>

                            For 2500 years, Sun Tzus Art of War has been a guide to leaders who want to achieve success without getting bogged down in further conflictto attain victory without fighting.  It teaches a way of being that helps you lead effectively in a world of complexity and chaos.  You can develop a way of knowing yourself, knowing others and knowing the things that make up your world.  Then you can help arrange them so their configuration of power brings about a victory that leaves both sides stronger.<br>
The Rules of Victory demonstrates how the skillful actions from this famous strategy manual can apply to you and your life.  The Art of War is not about an ancient approach from a foreign culture.  Rather it presents inherent human wisdom about a way of viewing and being in the world that gives rise to skillful action.<br>

                            High achievers set high standards for themselves and work energetically to achieve excellence, but their whole sense of self-worth is not dragged down if they dont meet those standards perfectly<br>
<br>
People who are perfectionistic have unrealistically high expectations for their performance, but take little joy in their accomplishments because their results are never quite good enough. This means that sometimes they avoid taking on certain challenges because they fear that they cant do them perfectly. Unlike high achievers who enjoy the flow of marshaling their strongest skills, stretching towards a challenge, and doing the best they can with the time and energy they have, perfectionists focus only on the goal and find the hard work and long hours exhausting and the results imperfect.<br>
<br>
If you suspect that you may be a perfectionist or you live or work with a perfectionist, taking this course will decrease your stress and increase your enjoyment of your work and your life.<br>
