                            Since our start in the spring of 2003, we&#39;ve been the innovators and industry leaders of home staging in Canada. We&#39;ve staged thousands of homes and work with individual home owners, investors, top realtors, builders and developers. And we&#39;ve been the subject of the award-winning HGTV series, The Stagers, which aired for two seasons across Canada and the US.<br>
<br>
We draw on the expertise of our diverse team of talented designers, stylists and other professionals to meet the unique needs of each client and property. We specialize in the enhancement of residential properties for sale, and we&#39;re committed to helping our clients maximize the selling price and speed the sale of their homes.<br>
<br>
From space-challenged urban condos to palatial estate homes and everything in between, we work with every type of property. In our consultation process, we determine your unique needs and budget, and tailor the services to fit.<br>
<br>
Using a proven approach, our staging experts evaluate each home inside and out, and recommend the strategies that will create the most engaging presentation ranging from lighting, furniture choice and placement, art and finishing touches to landscaping and exterior enhancements.<br>
<br>
We draw on our extensive inventory of furniture and accessories in our warehouses, choosing from our traditional, transitional, modernist, contemporary and emerging trend collections and continually sourced new items, and using original gallery artworks to complete the picture.<br>
<br>
We offer comprehensive staging services and can take care of everything needed to get a home ready to sell. Or if you prefer to do it yourself, we can provide the guidance you need. We can also coordinate almost every kind of service that may be needed to prepare your home for the market, from painting, repairs and maintenance to landscaping.<br>

Other times, it can be subtle details like smells, landscaping, unattractive paint colours or lack of furnishings. The light bulb went off when I learned about a new home staging company in Vancouver called DEKORA.&quot; <br>

&quot;My clients wanted to show their home at its best and maximize its value. I knew if they called DEKORA they could gain a competitive edge and create an even more inviting home. The excitement we saw from buyers was amazing. The team at DEKORA knew exactly what motivates buyers in this market and created a homey atmosphere that made the first impression the best impression.&quot;<br>

&quot;We&#39;d heard about home staging through friends and on TV and decided to work with DEKORA to prepare our home for sale before we listed it on the market. Our home looked fabulous and it sold for $30,000 over our asking price in a matter of one week! Unbelievable! Our realtor and his colleagues were stunned!&quot;<br>

&quot;Two other realtors were unable to sell my client&#39;s home over a TWO year period in one of the hottest real estate markets on record. When I took over the listing, I recommended we work with DEKORA to prepare the property for sale. After my client&#39;s home received DEKORA&#39;s &quot;touch&quot; it sold quickly. With DEKORA delivering such remarkable results for this property, imagine the impact they would have on the sale of a &quot;hot&quot; property.&quot; <br>

&quot;Having listed a penthouse apartment for an extended period with no offers, I needed to create the &#39;WOW&#39; factor. DEKORA chose the perfect furnishings and created a welcoming ambience for our target buyer. The result - multiple offers and it sold for more than the asking price! WOW! The next sale where my clients used DEKORA&#39;s services netted them an astonishing $26,250 over their asking price!&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank you so much for your prompt attention. Both my client and I were most impressed with your design talents and the manner in which it all came together in such a short period of time. I will most definitely pass your name on to anyone who may require your expertise, which certainly contributed in the fast sale of this property. I wish all of my sellers would engage in your services prior to listing their home for sale!! It would certainly create a faster sale and in many cases, I feel, result in a higher selling price.&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank-you for your assisitance in &quot;staging&quot; our house. In a sellers market, buyers have only a few hours, and in some cases, minutes, to make up their mind as to wether to make an offer or not.. The subtle touches your professionals reccomended, things I would have never thought of,completely changed the look and feel of my house. It truly looked like a show home. It sold for $41,000 more than asking price.&quot;<br>

&quot;I recently purchased and renovated a character house and planned on selling it vacant until I heard about DEKORA. I had spent thousands of dollars creating an atmosphere that would attract buyers - things like beautifully restored hardwood floors, luxurious bathrooms, a gourmet kitchen and landscaping. After making such a large investment on the renovation, I believed that showing the house vacant made no sense because most potential buyers are unable to visualize what a vacant property will look like as a &quot;home&quot;. I asked myself, &quot;would I leave the kitchen or bathrooms unfinished and hope potential buyers would &quot;visualize&quot; what they could look like?&quot; I felt that showing the house vacant would be the same as simply not finishing a portion of the renovation. I contacted DEKORA and decided to invest in having the property staged. DEKORA quickly and affordably furnished the house on a rental basis and I&#39;m convinced that the atmosphere they created contributed to selling the home quickly and for its maximum value.&quot; <br>

&quot;DEKORA&#39;s upscale styling and finishing touches made our home look like a million bucks - it sold within a week for more than we expected!!! I never could have done it myself! If you want top dollar for your property, I highly recommend DEKORA!&quot; <br>

Its crucial for home sellers to invest the time, effort and money to create a positive first impression and an atmosphere that triggers prospective buyers into quickly making maximum offers. DEKORA created a remarkable atmosphere at our clients townhome development and the results have exceeded all our expectations. In our experience, home staging is well worth the investment and DEKORA are the people to do it. <br>

&quot;Our experience was very positive and we received numerous complimentary comments on the changes. The consensus was that the &quot;look&quot; you presented for our home was both extremely attractive and much more marketable.&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank you for the expert eye and talent you brought to our home to help us get ready to sell! Let me tell you, it appears to have worked magically as it sold the first day, and there were so many good reactions to the house. The experience was a very positive one and I&#39;d use your services again in a heartbeat.&quot; <br>

&quot;DEKORA really knows their stuff! They were professional, practical and fun. They had great suggestions for enhancing the feeling of beauty and comfort in every room of our home with a minimum of fuss and cost. With their help, our house can put its best foot forward when we sell and help us achieve the best possible price.&quot; <br>

&quot;Home staging is an important part of selling a home. I&#39;ve used DEKORA&#39;s services with great success and recommend both the concept of home staging and DEKORA.&quot; <br>

&quot;Home Staging&quot; is another opportunity for you to stand out from the crowd. People spend $20.00 on Turtle wax to try to get $100.00 more for the sale of their car but too often no time or money on their home, usually their biggest asset. Savvy Realtors know that &quot;Staging&quot; is absolutely necessary to ensure that the property gets the owner the most money as quickly as possible.&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course you know that our townhouse sold immediately, and at ($26,250) more than our asking price. We believed he was right when Stephen Burke recommended that we &#39;stage&#39; the home. In hindsight, we are very pleased that he recommended you for the job. We give great credit to you for the fact the unit sold so quickly and at such a satisfactory price. We would certainly recommend your services to friends or prospective sellers.&quot;<br>

&quot;After our home sat the market for two years with no offers and we&#39;d gone through several different realtors, we almost gave up on selling. We decided to list with one more realtor and she recommended we contact DEKORA and have our home staged. DEKORA met with us, toured our entire home and made a number of changes. They de-cluttered re-arranged furnishings and brought in new furnishings and artwork on a rental basis. We re-listed our newly staged home and after a short while it SOLD! Needless to say, we were thrilled with the results! We&#39;ll undoubtedly use DEKORA again if we sell and recommend anyone considering the sale of their home to do the same.&quot;<br>

&quot;Thank you for enhancing the look and atmosphere of our home! We greatly appreciated the speed and convenience as well as talent that your firm provided; in a matter of hours you transformed many rooms into very attractive spaces and we would not have been able to achieve the same result ourselves. These types of enhancements are an integral part of the overall preparations for sale and a great value for those of us with limited time.&quot;<br>

&quot;I am delighted to provide a referral for DEKORA. Their staging services are well worth the money for any home seller. <br>
<br>
On a recent project DEKORA simply spent a day with cleaners and packers clearing a townhouse of excess clutter, arranging existing art to better advantage, and doing simple things like adding new towels and soaps in bathrooms, rearranging some of the existing furnishings and basically pulling the place together to ready it for showing. The service was very affordable and the homeowner was delighted with the service and the price. I will definitely continue to recommend the team at DEKORA to my clients.&quot;<br>

&quot;Thanks very much for making the sale of our house a quick one. Due to the exterior design it had been on the market for almost a year when we bought it. Being in the investment real estate business I&#39;m very familiar with the value of a show suite in a condominium building but until hearing of Dekora didn&#39;t think there was a corresponding opportunity for a single family home. We are very happy with the sale price we achieved and believe that we realized a 10x return on our investment in having Dekora stage our home. Your team was pleasant and professional and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend your service.&quot;<br>

&quot;I usually show my properties vacant, but I heard about the success other sellers were having with home staging. Instead of testing the market first and showing the properties vacant, I decided to invest in home staging for the first open. DEKORA created an atmosphere that clearly connected with potential buyers and I quickly sold all my properties. In retrospect, the principle of home staging makes complete sense and it really is quite simple. If you make a property look great and enticing to buyers it&#39;ll sell faster and at a maximum price.&quot;<br>

                            Since our start in the spring of 2003, we&#39;ve been the innovators and industry leaders of home staging in Canada. We&#39;ve staged thousands of homes and work with individual home owners, investors, top realtors, builders and developers. And we&#39;ve been the subject of the award-winning HGTV series, The Stagers, which aired for two seasons across Canada and the US.<br>
<br>
We draw on the expertise of our diverse team of talented designers, stylists and other professionals to meet the unique needs of each client and property. We specialize in the enhancement of residential properties for sale, and we&#39;re committed to helping our clients maximize the selling price and speed the sale of their homes.<br>
<br>
From space-challenged urban condos to palatial estate homes and everything in between, we work with every type of property. In our consultation process, we determine your unique needs and budget, and tailor the services to fit.<br>
<br>
Using a proven approach, our staging experts evaluate each home inside and out, and recommend the strategies that will create the most engaging presentation ranging from lighting, furniture choice and placement, art and finishing touches to landscaping and exterior enhancements.<br>
<br>
We draw on our extensive inventory of furniture and accessories in our warehouses, choosing from our traditional, transitional, modernist, contemporary and emerging trend collections and continually sourced new items, and using original gallery artworks to complete the picture.<br>
<br>
We offer comprehensive staging services and can take care of everything needed to get a home ready to sell. Or if you prefer to do it yourself, we can provide the guidance you need.

              &quot;If the homeowner wants top dollar, but their location is not good, then that house might sit for awhile. Other times, it can be subtle details like smells, landscaping, unattractive paint colours or lack of furnishings. The light bulb went off when I learned about a new home staging company in Vancouver called DEKORA.&quot; <br>

&quot;My clients wanted to show their home at its best and maximize its value. I knew if they called DEKORA they could gain a competitive edge and create an even more inviting home. The excitement we saw from buyers was amazing.

&quot;We&#39;d heard about home staging through friends and on TV and decided to work with DEKORA to prepare our home for sale before we listed it on the market. Our home looked fabulous and it sold for $30,000 over our asking price in a matter of one week! Unbelievable! Our realtor and his colleagues were stunned!&quot;<br>

&quot;Two other realtors were unable to sell my client&#39;s home over a TWO year period in one of the hottest real estate markets on record. When I took over the listing, I recommended we work with DEKORA to prepare the property for sale. After my client&#39;s home received DEKORA&#39;s &quot;touch&quot; it sold quickly. With DEKORA delivering such remarkable results for this property, imagine the impact they would have on the sale of a &quot;hot&quot; property.&quot; <br>

DEKORA chose the perfect furnishings and created a welcoming ambience for our target buyer. The result - multiple offers and it sold for more than the asking price! WOW! The next sale where my clients used DEKORA&#39;s services netted them an astonishing $26,250 over their asking price!&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank you so much for your prompt attention. Both my client and I were most impressed with your design talents and the manner in which it all came together in such a short period of time. I will most definitely pass your name on to anyone who may require your expertise, which certainly contributed in the fast sale of this property. I wish all of my sellers would engage in your services prior to listing their home for sale!! It would certainly create a faster sale and in many cases, I feel, result in a higher selling price.&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank-you for your assisitance in &quot;staging&quot; our house. In a sellers market, buyers have only a few hours, and in some cases, minutes, to make up their mind as to wether to make an offer or not.. The subtle touches your professionals reccomended, things I would have never thought of,completely changed the look and feel of my house. It truly looked like a show home. It sold for $41,000 more than asking price.&quot;<br>

&quot;I recently purchased and renovated a character house and planned on selling it vacant until I heard about DEKORA. I had spent thousands of dollars creating an atmosphere that would attract buyers - things like beautifully restored hardwood floors, luxurious bathrooms, a gourmet kitchen and landscaping. After making such a large investment on the renovation, I believed that showing the house vacant made no sense because most potential buyers are unable to visualize what a vacant property will look like as a &quot;home&quot;. I asked myself, &quot;would I leave the kitchen or bathrooms unfinished and hope potential buyers would &quot;visualize&quot; what they could look like?&quot; I felt that showing the house vacant would be the same as simply not finishing a portion of the renovation. I contacted DEKORA and decided to invest in having the property staged. DEKORA quickly and affordably furnished the house on a rental basis and I&#39;m convinced that the atmosphere they created contributed to selling the home quickly and for its maximum value.&quot; <br>

People purchase residential real estate based on first impressions and emotion. Its crucial for home sellers to invest the time, effort and money to create a positive first impression and an atmosphere that triggers prospective buyers into quickly making maximum offers.

&quot;Home Staging&quot; is another opportunity for you to stand out from the crowd. People spend $20.00 on Turtle wax to try to get $100.00 more for the sale of their car but too often no time or money on their home, usually their biggest asset. Savvy Realtors know that &quot;Staging&quot; is absolutely necessary to ensure that the property gets the owner the most money as quickly as possible.&quot;<br>

&quot;Of course you know that our townhouse sold immediately, and at ($26,250) more than our asking price. We believed he was right when Stephen Burke recommended that we &#39;stage&#39; the home. In hindsight, we are very pleased that he recommended you for the job. We give great credit to you for the fact the unit sold so quickly and at such a satisfactory price. We would certainly recommend your services to friends or prospective sellers.&quot;<br>

&quot;After our home sat the market for two years with no offers and we&#39;d gone through several different realtors, we almost gave up on selling. We decided to list with one more realtor and she recommended we contact DEKORA and have our home staged. DEKORA met with us, toured our entire home and made a number of changes. They de-cluttered re-arranged furnishings and brought in new furnishings and artwork on a rental basis. We re-listed our newly staged home and after a short while it SOLD! Needless to say, we were thrilled with the results! We&#39;ll undoubtedly use DEKORA again if we sell and recommend anyone considering the sale of their home to do the same.&quot;<br>

We greatly appreciated the speed and convenience as well as talent that your firm provided; in a matter of hours you transformed many rooms into very attractive spaces and we would not have been able to achieve the same result ourselves. These types of enhancements are an integral part of the overall preparations for sale and a great value for those of us with limited time.&quot;<br>

&quot;I am delighted to provide a referral for DEKORA. Their staging services are well worth the money for any home seller. <br>
<br>
On a recent project DEKORA simply spent a day with cleaners and packers clearing a townhouse of excess clutter, arranging existing art to better advantage, and doing simple things like adding new towels and soaps in bathrooms, rearranging some of the existing furnishings and basically pulling the place together to ready it for showing. The service was very affordable and the homeowner was delighted with the service and the price. I will definitely continue to recommend the team at DEKORA to my clients.&quot;<br>

&quot;Thanks very much for making the sale of our house a quick one. Due to the exterior design it had been on the market for almost a year when we bought it. Being in the investment real estate business I&#39;m very familiar with the value of a show suite in a condominium building but until hearing of Dekora didn&#39;t think there was a corresponding opportunity for a single family home. We are very happy with the sale price we achieved and believe that we realized a 10x return on our investment in having Dekora stage our home. Your team was pleasant and professional and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend your service.&quot;<br>

&quot;I usually show my properties vacant, but I heard about the success other sellers were having with home staging. Instead of testing the market first and showing the properties vacant, I decided to invest in home staging for the first open. DEKORA created an atmosphere that clearly connected with potential buyers and I quickly sold all my properties. In retrospect, the principle of home staging makes complete sense and it really is quite simple. If you make a property look great and enticing to buyers it&#39;ll sell faster and at a maximum price.&quot;<br>
