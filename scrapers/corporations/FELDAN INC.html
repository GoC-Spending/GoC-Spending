Introduction:<br>
RAGMCSF is a cytokine that controls the production, differentiation, and function of granulocytes and macrophages. The active form of the protein is found extracellularly as a homodimer. This gene has been localized to a cluster of related genes at chromosome region 5q31, which is known to be associated with interstitial deletions in the 5q- syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia. Other genes in the cluster include those encoding interleukins 4, 5, and 13.<br>
GM-CSF stimulates the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells from various lineages, including granulocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and erythrocytes.<br>
<br>
Description :<br>
Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor Human Recombinant produced in E.coli is a single, non-glycosylated, polypeptide chain containing 127 amino acids and having a molecular mass of 14477 Dalton.<br>
GM-CSF is purified by proprietary chromatographic techniques.<br>
<br>
Synonyms:<br>
CSF-2, MGI-1GM, GM-CSF, Pluripoietin-alpha, Molgramostin, Sargramostim, MGC131935, MGC138897.<br>
<br>
Physical Appearance:<br>
Sterile Filtered White lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder.<br>
<br>
Formulation:<br>
GM-CSF was lyophilized after extensive dialysis against 2mM sodium phosphate buffer pH= 7.4±0.1.<br>
<br>
Solubility:<br>
It is recommended to reconstitute the lyophilized Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor in sterile 18M&amp;#937;-cm H2O not less than 100µg/ml, which can then be further diluted to other aqueous solutions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stability:<br>
Lyophilized Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor although stable at room temperature for 3 weeks, should be stored desiccated below -18°C. Upon reconstitution GMCSF should be stored at 4°C between 2-7 days and for future use below -18°C. For long term storage it is recommended to add a carrier protein (0.1% HSA or BSA). Please avoid freeze-thaw cycles.<br>
<br>
Purity:<br>
Greater than 98.0% as determined by:<br>
(a) Analysis by RP-HPLC.<br>
(b) Analysis by SDS-PAGE.<br>
<br>
Amino acid sequence:<br>
The sequence of the first five N-terminal amino acids was determined and was found to be Ala-Pro-Ala-Arg-Ser. N-terminal methionine has been completely removed enzymatically.<br>
<br>
Biological Activity:<br>
The ED50 as determined by the dose-dependant stimulation of the proliferation of human TF-1 cells (human erythroleukemic indicator cell line) is &lt; 0.1 ng/ml, corresponding to a Specific Activity of 11.1x106 IU/mg.<br>
<br>
Protein content:<br>
GM-CSF quantitation was carried out by two independent methods:<br>
1. UV spectroscopy at 280 nm using the absorbency value of 0.963 as the extinction coefficient for a 0.1% (1mg/ml) solution. This value is calculated by the PC GENE computer analysis program of protein sequences (IntelliGenetics).<br>
2. Analysis by RP-HPLC, using a standard solution of GM-CSF as a Reference Standard.<br>

Background:<br>
IGF is a well-characterized basic peptide believed to be secreted by the liver and to circulate in the blood. It has growth-regulating, insulin-like, and mitogenic activities. This growth factor has a major, but not absolute, dependence on Somatotropin. It is believed to be mainly active in adults in contrast to Insulin like Growth Factor 2, which is a major fetal growth factor.<br>
<br>
Description :<br>
Recombinant Human IGF-I produced in E.coli is a single, non-glycosylated, polypeptide chain containing 70 amino acids and having a molecular mass of 7655 Dalton.<br>
Recombinant IGF-I is purified by proprietary chromatographic techniques.<br>
<br>
Physical Appearance:<br>
Sterile Filtered White lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder.<br>
<br>
Formulation:<br>
IGF-1 was lyophilized after extensive dialysis against 50mM acetic acid.<br>
Solubility:<br>
It is recommended to reconstitute the lyophilized IGF-1 in sterile 18M&amp;#8486;-cm H2O not less than 100µg/ml, which can then be further diluted to other aqueous solutions.<br>
<br>
Stability:<br>
Lyophilized IGF-1 although stable at room temperature for 3 weeks, should be stored desiccated below -18°C. Upon reconstitution IGF-I should be stored at 4°C between 2-7 days and for future use below -18°C. For long term storage it is recommended to add a carrier protein (0.1% HSA or BSA).<br>
Please avoid freeze-thaw cycles.<br>
<br>
Purity:<br>
Greater than 98.0% as determined by:<br>
(a) Analysis by RP-HPLC.<br>
(b) Anion-exchange FPLC.<br>
(c) Analysis by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE Silver Stained gel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Amino acid sequence:<br>
The sequence of the first five N-terminal amino acids was determined and was found to be Gly-Pro-Glu-Thr-Leu. N-terminal methionine has been completely removed enzymatically.<br>
<br>
Dimers and aggregates:<br>
Less than 1% as determined by silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel analysis.<br>
<br>
Biological Activity:<br>
Feldan Bio&#39;s IGF-I is fully biologically active when compared to standards. The ED50, calculated by the dose-dependant proliferation of murine BALB\C 3T3 cells (measured by H-thymidine uptake) is less then 1.0 ng/ml, corresponding to a specific activity of 1x106U/mg. For most in-vitro applications, IGF-I exerts its biological activity in the concentration range of 0.2-20 ng/ml.<br>
<br>
Endotoxin:<br>
Less than 0.1 ng/µg (IEU/µg) of IGF-I.<br>
<br>
Protein content:<br>
Protein quantitation was carried out by two independent methods:<br>
1. UV spectroscopy at 280 nm using the absorbency value of 0.502 as the extinction coefficient for a 0.1% (1mg/ml) solution. This value is calculated by the PC GENE computer analysis program of protein sequences (IntelliGenetics).<br>
2. Analysis by RP-HPLC, using a standard solution of IGF-I as a Reference Standard.<br>

Source:<br>
 	E. coli<br>
Background: <br>
 Wnt-1 is a secreted protein that signals through the Frizzled family of cell surface receptors and is required for normal embryonic development. Wnt-1 activation induces a complex signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the increased expression of over fifty genes. An important component of Wnt-1 signaling is the stabilization, and resulting accumulation, of the intracellular signaling protein, beta-catenine. Wnt signaling induces and maintains the transformed phenotype and, in certain embryonic cell lines, supports self renewal in the absence of significant differentiation. Elevated levels of Wnt proteins are associated with tumorigenesis and are present in numerous human breast cancers. Mature human Wnt-1 is a glycosylated protein containing 343 amino acid residues. This recombinant human Wnt-1 is a 38.4 kDa, non-glycosylated protein containing 343 amino acid residues.<br>
<br>
Supplied:<br>
 Lyophilized powder with no additives.<br>
<br>
Purity:<br>
 &gt;98% by SDS-Page analysis. Endotoxin level is less than 0.1ng per ug (1EU/ug) of Wnt-1.<br>
<br>
Reconstitution:<br>
 The lyophilized protein is soluble in water and most aqueous buffers. The lyophilized powder should be reconstituted in water to a max concentration of 0.1-1mg/ml.<br>
<br>
Allow to set at least 30 minutes at 4°C, tighten cap and rotate to reconstitute any material on sides of vial. If desired, you can centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 minute to concentrate volume in bottom of vial. This solution can be diluted into water or other buffered solutions or stored at 4°C for up to 1 week or at - 20°C for future use.<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
If this material is not to be used for coating or labeling(or other applications requiring carrier free material), the addition of 0.1% BSA to further dilution buffers or dilution in sterile culture media is recommended to enhance tability and minimize absorption to vial.<br>
<br>
Storage: <br>
The lyophilized powder is stable at room temperature for a few weeks but it is best stored desiccated at -20 Deg C. Reconstituted human Wnt-1 should be stored in working aliquots at        -20°C. AVOID FREQUENT FREEZE THAW CYCLES.<br>
<br>
Reactivity: <br>
The ED50 was determined by its ability to enhance BMP-2 induced alkaline phosphatase production by murine ATDC5 cells. The expected ED50 for this effect is 1.5 - 2.5 ng/ml in the presence of 200 ng/ml of human BMP-2.<br>

Introduction:<br>
RAGMCSF is a cytokine that controls the production, differentiation, and function of granulocytes and macrophages. The active form of the protein is found extracellularly as a homodimer. This gene has been localized to a cluster of related genes at chromosome region 5q31, which is known to be associated with interstitial deletions in the 5q- syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia. Other genes in the cluster include those encoding interleukins 4, 5, and 13.<br>
GM-CSF stimulates the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells from various lineages, including granulocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and erythrocytes.<br>
<br>
Description :<br>
Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor Human Recombinant produced in E.coli is a single, non-glycosylated, polypeptide chain containing 127 amino acids and having a molecular mass of 14477 Dalton.<br>
GM-CSF is purified by proprietary chromatographic techniques.<br>
<br>
Synonyms:<br>
CSF-2, MGI-1GM, GM-CSF, Pluripoietin-alpha, Molgramostin, Sargramostim, MGC131935, MGC138897.<br>
<br>
Physical Appearance:<br>
Sterile Filtered White lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder.<br>
<br>
Formulation:<br>
GM-CSF was lyophilized after extensive dialysis against 2mM sodium phosphate buffer pH= 7.4±0.1.<br>
<br>
Solubility:<br>
It is recommended to reconstitute the lyophilized Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor in sterile 18M&amp;#937;-cm H2O not less than 100µg/ml, which can then be further diluted to other aqueous solutions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Stability:<br>
Lyophilized Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor although stable at room temperature for 3 weeks, should be stored desiccated below -18°C. Upon reconstitution GMCSF should be stored at 4°C between 2-7 days and for future use below -18°C. For long term storage it is recommended to add a carrier protein (0.1% HSA or BSA). Please avoid freeze-thaw cycles.<br>
<br>
Purity:<br>
Greater than 98.0% as determined by:<br>
(a) Analysis by RP-HPLC.<br>
(b) Analysis by SDS-PAGE.<br>
<br>
Amino acid sequence:<br>
The sequence of the first five N-terminal amino acids was determined and was found to be Ala-Pro-Ala-Arg-Ser. N-terminal methionine has been completely removed enzymatically.<br>
<br>
Biological Activity:<br>
The ED50 as determined by the dose-dependant stimulation of the proliferation of human TF-1 cells (human erythroleukemic indicator cell line) is &lt; 0.1 ng/ml, corresponding to a Specific Activity of 11.1x106 IU/mg.<br>
<br>
Protein content:<br>
GM-CSF quantitation was carried out by two independent methods:<br>
1. UV spectroscopy at 280 nm using the absorbency value of 0.963 as the extinction coefficient for a 0.1% (1mg/ml) solution. This value is calculated by the PC GENE computer analysis program of protein sequences (IntelliGenetics).<br>
2. Analysis by RP-HPLC, using a standard solution of GM-CSF as a Reference Standard.<br>

Source:<br>
 	E.coli<br>
Background:<br>
IGF is a well-characterized basic peptide believed to be secreted by the liver and to circulate in the blood. It has growth-regulating, insulin-like, and mitogenic activities. This growth factor has a major, but not absolute, dependence on Somatotropin. It is believed to be mainly active in adults in contrast to Insulin like Growth Factor 2, which is a major fetal growth factor.<br>
<br>
Description :<br>
Recombinant Human IGF-I produced in E.coli is a single, non-glycosylated, polypeptide chain containing 70 amino acids and having a molecular mass of 7655 Dalton.<br>
Recombinant IGF-I is purified by proprietary chromatographic techniques.<br>
<br>
Physical Appearance:<br>
Sterile Filtered White lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder.<br>
<br>
Formulation:<br>
IGF-1 was lyophilized after extensive dialysis against 50mM acetic acid.<br>
Solubility:<br>
It is recommended to reconstitute the lyophilized IGF-1 in sterile 18M&amp;#8486;-cm H2O not less than 100µg/ml, which can then be further diluted to other aqueous solutions.<br>
<br>
Stability:<br>
Lyophilized IGF-1 although stable at room temperature for 3 weeks, should be stored desiccated below -18°C. Upon reconstitution IGF-I should be stored at 4°C between 2-7 days and for future use below -18°C. For long term storage it is recommended to add a carrier protein (0.1% HSA or BSA).<br>
Please avoid freeze-thaw cycles.<br>
<br>
Purity:<br>
Greater than 98.0% as determined by:<br>
(a) Analysis by RP-HPLC.<br>
(b) Anion-exchange FPLC.<br>
(c) Analysis by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE Silver Stained gel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Amino acid sequence:<br>
The sequence of the first five N-terminal amino acids was determined and was found to be Gly-Pro-Glu-Thr-Leu. N-terminal methionine has been completely removed enzymatically.<br>
<br>
Dimers and aggregates:<br>
Less than 1% as determined by silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel analysis.<br>
<br>
Biological Activity:<br>
Feldan Bio&#39;s IGF-I is fully biologically active when compared to standards. The ED50, calculated by the dose-dependant proliferation of murine BALB\C 3T3 cells (measured by H-thymidine uptake) is less then 1.0 ng/ml, corresponding to a specific activity of 1x106U/mg. For most in-vitro applications, IGF-I exerts its biological activity in the concentration range of 0.2-20 ng/ml.<br>
<br>
Endotoxin:<br>
Less than 0.1 ng/µg (IEU/µg) of IGF-I.<br>
<br>
Protein content:<br>
Protein quantitation was carried out by two independent methods:<br>
1. UV spectroscopy at 280 nm using the absorbency value of 0.502 as the extinction coefficient for a 0.1% (1mg/ml) solution. This value is calculated by the PC GENE computer analysis program of protein sequences (IntelliGenetics).<br>
2. Analysis by RP-HPLC, using a standard solution of IGF-I as a Reference Standard.<br>

 	Recombinant Human Wnt-1<br>
Source:<br>
 	E. coli<br>
Background: <br>
 Wnt-1 is a secreted protein that signals through the Frizzled family of cell surface receptors and is required for normal embryonic development. Wnt-1 activation induces a complex signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the increased expression of over fifty genes. An important component of Wnt-1 signaling is the stabilization, and resulting accumulation, of the intracellular signaling protein, beta-catenine. Wnt signaling induces and maintains the transformed phenotype and, in certain embryonic cell lines, supports self renewal in the absence of significant differentiation. Elevated levels of Wnt proteins are associated with tumorigenesis and are present in numerous human breast cancers. Mature human Wnt-1 is a glycosylated protein containing 343 amino acid residues. This recombinant human Wnt-1 is a 38.4 kDa, non-glycosylated protein containing 343 amino acid residues.<br>
<br>
Supplied:<br>
 Lyophilized powder with no additives.<br>
<br>
Purity:<br>
 &gt;98% by SDS-Page analysis. Endotoxin level is less than 0.1ng per ug (1EU/ug) of Wnt-1.<br>
<br>
Reconstitution:<br>
 The lyophilized protein is soluble in water and most aqueous buffers. The lyophilized powder should be reconstituted in water to a max concentration of 0.1-1mg/ml.<br>
<br>
Allow to set at least 30 minutes at 4°C, tighten cap and rotate to reconstitute any material on sides of vial. If desired, you can centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 minute to concentrate volume in bottom of vial. This solution can be diluted into water or other buffered solutions or stored at 4°C for up to 1 week or at - 20°C for future use.<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
If this material is not to be used for coating or labeling(or other applications requiring carrier free material), the addition of 0.1% BSA to further dilution buffers or dilution in sterile culture media is recommended to enhance tability and minimize absorption to vial.<br>
<br>
Storage: <br>
The lyophilized powder is stable at room temperature for a few weeks but it is best stored desiccated at -20 Deg C. Reconstituted human Wnt-1 should be stored in working aliquots at        -20°C. AVOID FREQUENT FREEZE THAW CYCLES.<br>
<br>
Reactivity: <br>
The ED50 was determined by its ability to enhance BMP-2 induced alkaline phosphatase production by murine ATDC5 cells. The expected ED50 for this effect is 1.5 - 2.5 ng/ml in the presence of 200 ng/ml of human BMP-2.<br>
