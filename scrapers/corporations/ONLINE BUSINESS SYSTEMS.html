                            - Governance: Security governance is at the core of your information security program. To be successful, you need a security program that is tightly aligned with your business&#39;s operations today and its plans for the future. We will design, develop, and implement programs to address the unique needs of your organization – from initial risk assessment, to policy development, through to communication to your board and management teams.<br>
<br>
- Remediation: Knowing what to do in security is only half the battle – knowing how to do it and doing it right is the other. Our skilled professionals can help you remediate identified gaps and implement technology controls and security architectures for everything from individual applications to entire enterprise infrastructures.<br>
<br>
- Assessment: Your organization is constantly evolving, as are the threats to your company, the infrastructure you maintain, and the industry and regulatory environment that you operate in. In response, we will identify the gaps and vulnerabilities that exist within your organization – from individual applications through to your entire enterprise’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Our assessments prioritize findings so that you can devote resources to getting the greatest benefit.<br>
<br>
- Operations: Managing your security program can be a challenge. Technology is constantly changing, and the capital costs and investment needed to find and retain skilled security professionals to implement, manage, and maintain the program can be daunting. Through our Security Operations services, we will work with you to ensure your security operations are working efficiently and effectively and that you have the technology, people, and processes you need.<br>

                            - Business Transformation: To stay competitive your organization must successfully be able to anticipate, respond and dynamically to changes in the marketplace - continually. The ability to successfully transform your business is imperative; doing it successfully is challenging. We use a transformation framework that holistically addresses strategy, people, processes and technology. If you want sustainable improvement, you have to have all four components and you have to continuously manage your transformation program against results and expected value. The goal is to transform your company for success.<br>
<br>
- Solution Selection and Implementation: Selecting the right solution to support specific business needs is critical. Although the right solution will be unique to your business environment, the approach to finding it doesn’t have to be. Online’s Solution Selection service assists our clients through the process of effectively selecting the right solution - one that is aligned to support your distinct combination of requirements. Our Solution Selection Methodology provides a disciplined approach that is structured to build this alignment into the selection process right from the start.<br>
<br>
- Program and Project Management: With so much on the line, you can’t afford to have a project not be successful. You need to do more than deliver projects you need to deliver results – and you need to do it at an increasingly rapid place. This puts pressure on your management practices to be scalable, predictable and dynamic. Working with you, we will lead and inspire teams to deliver the outcomes and benefits you need. Our experience helps us ensure the integrity of project delivery and the dependencies between projects across your company.<br>
<br>
- Organizational Change Management: Successful companies today are not afraid of change and have invested in preparing their teams for the change that is required to grow. Change management is more than a skill, it’s an essential part of your organization’s culture that makes transformations succeed – if you want results you have to start enabling the right people to do the right things from the very beginning. Wherever you are at with your change management program we can help you. From creating strategy, managing change initiatives, to delivering training focused on training adoption our team of PROSCI certified experts can provide guidance and best practices to help make your next change a success. It starts with the right people, in the right roles driving strategy. And the right people, in the right roles being part of the change plan to implement the strategy. Organizations don&#39;t change, people do. To get results, individuals must behave differently.<br>
<br>
- Quality Assurance: If your company is like many others, your threshold for errors, poor performance and inconsistent behavior has diminished  as your customers have come to expect consistent, quality interactions.   The emphasis on quality has had a significant impact on how you expect technology solutions to behave.  To support these expectations, we treat quality as a mandatory requirement from the very beginning. We put quality-centric activities as early as possible on our projects and manage and measure them against both functional requirements and user experience requirements.  The result is a high quality solution that not only meets the functional objectives but one that is highly tuned to meet the quality expectations of your customers.<br>

                            - Application Development: Quite simply – we thrive on using technology that enables you to do more, do it better, and ultimately do it faster. You are unique and sometimes you need a custom solution that supports the unique ways you do business. We excel at designing, building and continually improving the applications that enable you effectively. And while we can help you build on-premise, cloud-enabled, or cloud native solutions we are less concerned about where they run (we can take care of that) we are committed to making sure that the applications are designed and developed with your most important customers in mind. We have proven expertise in Microsoft .NET, Java and web development technologies.<br>
<br>
- Application Management Services: Today&#39;s technology is increasingly complex and the rapid pace to innovation has meant that IT departments are being asked to balance the demands and costs of new technology against the management of the existing application portfolio. This is not a simple challenge. Our Application Management Services (AMS) offering provides cost-effective solutions that help IT departments drive business value out of your existing portfolio, while allowing you to focusing on the solutions that are strategically important. Through a managed services model we offer scalability and technical expertise that delivers application availability, security, and improved performance across your application portfolio.<br>
<br>
- System Integration: New technology solutions are emerging every day that provide opportunities to enable and transform your organization like never before. While these solutions solve important business problems, they can create equally complex integration problems. Too often the integration requirements are not understood upfront and result in confusion, delay or worse - failed projects. Our understanding of both business and technology allows us to work effectively with you, your suppliers and your clients to make sure that all integration requirements are addressed. We develop and implement a plan that considers the end-to-end business processes through architecture, design, and systems requirements that ensures your systems work together and are enabled to share information.<br>
<br>
- Cloud Deployment: The Cloud is more than just a platform – it’s a new way of operating that provides scalability and flexibility. You need a multi-part strategy to successfully take advantage of the platform and the benefits the Cloud offers. Ultimately you need to determine what should be migrated, how to migrate and how to manage the environment while ensuring the security and viability of the applications you deploy. Our Cloud Services help get you going and provide sustainability once you have started to use the Cloud platform. Whether you are looking for help migrating to O365, need guidance to assess or develop migration plans, or are interested in help managing your environment our team of Cloud and security experts have the experience to help you meet your objectives.<br>

                            - Governance: Security governance is at the core of your information security program. To be successful, you need a security program that is tightly aligned with your business&#39;s operations today and its plans for the future. We will design, develop, and implement programs to address the unique needs of your organization – from initial risk assessment, to policy development, through to communication to your board and management teams.<br>
<br>
- Remediation: Knowing what to do in security is only half the battle – knowing how to do it and doing it right is the other. Our skilled professionals can help you remediate identified gaps and implement technology controls and security architectures for everything from individual applications to entire enterprise infrastructures.<br>
<br>
- Assessment: Your organization is constantly evolving, as are the threats to your company, the infrastructure you maintain, and the industry and regulatory environment that you operate in. In response, we will identify the gaps and vulnerabilities that exist within your organization – from individual applications through to your entire enterprise’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Our assessments prioritize findings so that you can devote resources to getting the greatest benefit.<br>
<br>
- Operations: Managing your security program can be a challenge. Technology is constantly changing, and the capital costs and investment needed to find and retain skilled security professionals to implement, manage, and maintain the program can be daunting. Through our Security Operations services, we will work with you to ensure your security operations are working efficiently and effectively and that you have the technology, people, and processes you need.<br>

                            - Business Transformation: To stay competitive your organization must successfully be able to anticipate, respond and dynamically to changes in the marketplace - continually. The ability to successfully transform your business is imperative; doing it successfully is challenging. We use a transformation framework that holistically addresses strategy, people, processes and technology. If you want sustainable improvement, you have to have all four components and you have to continuously manage your transformation program against results and expected value. The goal is to transform your company for success.<br>
<br>
- Solution Selection and Implementation: Selecting the right solution to support specific business needs is critical. Although the right solution will be unique to your business environment, the approach to finding it doesn’t have to be. Online’s Solution Selection service assists our clients through the process of effectively selecting the right solution - one that is aligned to support your distinct combination of requirements. Our Solution Selection Methodology provides a disciplined approach that is structured to build this alignment into the selection process right from the start.<br>
<br>
- Program and Project Management: With so much on the line, you can’t afford to have a project not be successful. You need to do more than deliver projects you need to deliver results – and you need to do it at an increasingly rapid place. This puts pressure on your management practices to be scalable, predictable and dynamic. Working with you, we will lead and inspire teams to deliver the outcomes and benefits you need. Our experience helps us ensure the integrity of project delivery and the dependencies between projects across your company.<br>
<br>
- Organizational Change Management: Successful companies today are not afraid of change and have invested in preparing their teams for the change that is required to grow. Change management is more than a skill, it’s an essential part of your organization’s culture that makes transformations succeed – if you want results you have to start enabling the right people to do the right things from the very beginning. Wherever you are at with your change management program we can help you. From creating strategy, managing change initiatives, to delivering training focused on training adoption our team of PROSCI certified experts can provide guidance and best practices to help make your next change a success. It starts with the right people, in the right roles driving strategy. And the right people, in the right roles being part of the change plan to implement the strategy. Organizations don&#39;t change, people do. To get results, individuals must behave differently.<br>
<br>
- Quality Assurance: If your company is like many others, your threshold for errors, poor performance and inconsistent behavior has diminished  as your customers have come to expect consistent, quality interactions.   The emphasis on quality has had a significant impact on how you expect technology solutions to behave.  To support these expectations, we treat quality as a mandatory requirement from the very beginning. We put quality-centric activities as early as possible on our projects and manage and measure them against both functional requirements and user experience requirements.  The result is a high quality solution that not only meets the functional objectives but one that is highly tuned to meet the quality expectations of your customers.<br>

                            - Application Development: Quite simply – we thrive on using technology that enables you to do more, do it better, and ultimately do it faster. You are unique and sometimes you need a custom solution that supports the unique ways you do business. We excel at designing, building and continually improving the applications that enable you effectively. And while we can help you build on-premise, cloud-enabled, or cloud native solutions we are less concerned about where they run (we can take care of that) we are committed to making sure that the applications are designed and developed with your most important customers in mind. We have proven expertise in Microsoft .NET, Java and web development technologies.<br>
<br>
- Application Management Services: Today&#39;s technology is increasingly complex and the rapid pace to innovation has meant that IT departments are being asked to balance the demands and costs of new technology against the management of the existing application portfolio. This is not a simple challenge. Our Application Management Services (AMS) offering provides cost-effective solutions that help IT departments drive business value out of your existing portfolio, while allowing you to focusing on the solutions that are strategically important. Through a managed services model we offer scalability and technical expertise that delivers application availability, security, and improved performance across your application portfolio.<br>
<br>
- System Integration: New technology solutions are emerging every day that provide opportunities to enable and transform your organization like never before. While these solutions solve important business problems, they can create equally complex integration problems. Too often the integration requirements are not understood upfront and result in confusion, delay or worse - failed projects. Our understanding of both business and technology allows us to work effectively with you, your suppliers and your clients to make sure that all integration requirements are addressed. We develop and implement a plan that considers the end-to-end business processes through architecture, design, and systems requirements that ensures your systems work together and are enabled to share information.<br>
<br>
- Cloud Deployment: The Cloud is more than just a platform – it’s a new way of operating that provides scalability and flexibility. You need a multi-part strategy to successfully take advantage of the platform and the benefits the Cloud offers. Ultimately you need to determine what should be migrated, how to migrate and how to manage the environment while ensuring the security and viability of the applications you deploy. Our Cloud Services help get you going and provide sustainability once you have started to use the Cloud platform. Whether you are looking for help migrating to O365, need guidance to assess or develop migration plans, or are interested in help managing your environment our team of Cloud and security experts have the experience to help you meet your objectives.<br>
