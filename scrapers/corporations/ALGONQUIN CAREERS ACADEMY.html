                            The Legal Studies faculty at Algonquin Careers Academy offers two diploma programs: Paralegal and Legal Assistant. <br>
<br>
The objective of the Paralegal courses is to provide the student with the required substantive law training to successfully enter the Law Society of Upper Canada’s paralegal licensing process.  Students will learn constitutional and administrative law, client interviewing, legal research, evidence, small claims court, provincial offences, legal writing, dispute resolution and mediation, legal computer applications, tribunals, immigration law and landlord and tenant law. All law courses are taught by lawyers or licenced paralegals. The intensive structure of our paralegal program includes traditional lecture and seminar courses, as well as field trips to local Courts and tribunals. There are also a number of mock hearings and presentations throughout the program. A co-op placement will ensure our Paralegal students graduate with exposure to the profession, and the requisite hours to qualify for the Licensing process. <br>
<br>
The objective of the Legal Assistant course is to provide the student with the skills and confidence required to be employed as a Legal Assistant. The technical and clerical aspects of assisting a lawyer are emphasized throughout the program. The student will graduate with an in-depth and practical knowledge of legal terminology, drafting of various legal documents, legal office administration and law office software. Areas of law studied include: wills and power of attorney, real estate law, civil litigation, family law, and corporate and commercial law. Administrative and productivity skills are enhanced with the following courses: computer fundamentals with keyboarding, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, bookkeeping and effective business writing. A practical placement will ensure our Legal Assistant students graduate with exposure to the profession. <br>
