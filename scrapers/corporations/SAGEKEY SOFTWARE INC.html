        <br>            SageKey is a custom software development company that specializes in the Medical, Life Sciences, Business and Yellow Pages Industries. We have been in business for 14 years and have about 3500 customers from 45 countries.<br><br>We have been working within the Life Science community for about 10 years, working in the areas of Electronic Medical Records, Economic Modeling and Outcomes Research. The company is qualified to build medical software to FDA standards and maintains a formal software development process for these types of projects.<br><br>SageKey has been exposed to a very wide range of software development issues and has a knowledgeable team of software developers who are adept at solving complex programming needs.<br>We have evolved following the maxim that Outstanding companies are built by providing their clients outstanding service and support.  With a strong culture that is based on client focus, results and win-win, we are keenly interested in building outstanding software that aligns well with our clients needs and enhances their success.<br><br>SageKey is situated in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada, a wine and fruit growing region and a summer vacation destination with a strong high tech industry.<br><br>Since our inception we have successfully completed every project we have undertaken. Some examples of our work are:<br><br>	A full Electronic Medical Records system to FDA standards for the Dialysis industry in the USA.<br>	IRIS Online, developed for the Yellow Pages Association of America, is a very large web based program with over 12 GB of data used by national advertising companies to create national advertising campaigns.<br>	Cardiovascular Goal Manager developed for Pfizer Inc., is a software program used by physicians to manage patients cardiovascular health and monitor changes in their health.<br>	DART, an economic modeling program, developed for Pfizer to run complex costing models of disease states.<br>	Hundreds of custom development projects for businesses across North America.<br><br>

                            The most important part of any application is knowing that it works correctly. Data-centric applications often focus on the data more than on the functionality working correctly or looking good. Right from the beginning, SageKey has been involved in the design and development of database applications. We believe having the design right in the first place is a large portion of the solution. We employ our experience as well as design skills to make sure our customers applications are built on a good foundation.<br>
<br>
As the SageKey team has grown, so has our wealth of information. The combined knowledge of Access and SQL databases has been grounded in medicine, government, armed forces, education, hospitality, leisure and many other fields. This experience gives us a broad understanding of what is needed in just about every area of industry, so you can know that your application is being well looked after.<br>
<br>
We want to exceed our customers&#39; expectations which is why we work with our customers using our solid design methodologies to ensure that their requirements are met in a timely fashion and that handover goes smoothly.<br>

                            There comes a time in the lifetime of software when the development team ask &quot;Whats next?&quot; For the last decade VB6 was the most commonly used programming language which means that now a high percentage of the software currently in use was written in VB6.<br>
<br>
SageKey have been in the database development business since day one where Access was commonly used as it is today.<br>
<br>
Of course, long ago, Microsoft dropped support for earlier versions of Access (97, 2000) and with the &quot;it just works&quot; support for VB6 in Vista and Windows 7, applications making use of these technologies are in trouble.<br>
<br>
The .Net revolution is here to stay for the long term and here at SageKey we have our feet firmly entrenched in that. The migration from Access or VB6 to .Net is a process that we refer to as uplifting.<br>
<br>
SageKey Software is in the business of providing solutions rather than creating problems. Because of our skillset, we are well positioned to supply a solution whether youre looking to migrate an Access application to a desktop or web-based solution or whether you are looking at moving your backend data from Access to SQL.<br>
<br>
The benefits of moving to a .Net and/or SQL solution can, in most cases, outweigh the costs. So if you have a VB6 or Access application (2.0 right up to 2007) instead of asking yourself Whats next?, ask us!<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              SageKey has been working with and developing software for the Yellow Pages Industry since 2004. Our close involvment with the industry has lead us to having an in-depth understanding of its needs and business that few can match.<br>
<br>
Some of the projects we&#39;ve been involved with include YPA IRIS ONLINE, <br>
YPA CO-OP ONLINE, the YPA IRIS-based Web Service and the automated indexing of Yellow Pages headings.<br>
<br>
In 2004 the Yellow Pages Association asked SageKey to build a complex ASP.Net web-based application with the same functionality as their existing CD application. Both the timeframe and budget for the project were tight.<br>
<br>
SageKey put a three-person team on the project and delivered on time and on budget. The application was presented at a national convention a week later to rave reviews.<br>
<br>
Iris Online is a paid subscription service provided by the Yellow Pages Association and access to most of the site requires a password. The entry to the site can be viewed at irisonline.ypassociation.org<br>
<br>
12 years ago I stumbled upon a small vendor on the web. Today we no longer have a vendor, but a strategic partner in all of our development efforts. With projects ranging from simple installation scripts to industry wide web-based applications, SageKey has exceeded our expectations in every instance. Working with SageKey is not something that can be described, it is something that must be experienced.<br>

                            The most important part of any application is knowing that it works correctly. Data-centric applications often focus on the data more than on the functionality working correctly or looking good. Right from the beginning, SageKey has been involved in the design and development of database applications. We believe having the design right in the first place is a large portion of the solution. We employ our experience as well as design skills to make sure our customers applications are built on a good foundation.<br>
<br>
As the SageKey team has grown, so has our wealth of information. The combined knowledge of Access and SQL databases has been grounded in medicine, government, armed forces, education, hospitality, leisure and many other fields. This experience gives us a broad understanding of what is needed in just about every area of industry, so you can know that your application is being well looked after.<br>
<br>
We want to exceed our customers&#39; expectations which is why we work with our customers using our solid design methodologies to ensure that their requirements are met in a timely fashion and that handover goes smoothly.<br>

                            There comes a time in the lifetime of software when the development team ask &quot;Whats next?&quot; For the last decade VB6 was the most commonly used programming language which means that now a high percentage of the software currently in use was written in VB6.<br>
<br>
SageKey have been in the database development business since day one where Access was commonly used as it is today.<br>
<br>
Of course, long ago, Microsoft dropped support for earlier versions of Access (97, 2000) and with the &quot;it just works&quot; support for VB6 in Vista and Windows 7, applications making use of these technologies are in trouble.<br>
<br>
The .Net revolution is here to stay for the long term and here at SageKey we have our feet firmly entrenched in that. The migration from Access or VB6 to .Net is a process that we refer to as uplifting.<br>
<br>
SageKey Software is in the business of providing solutions rather than creating problems. Because of our skillset, we are well positioned to supply a solution whether youre looking to migrate an Access application to a desktop or web-based solution or whether you are looking at moving your backend data from Access to SQL.<br>
<br>
The benefits of moving to a .Net and/or SQL solution can, in most cases, outweigh the costs. So if you have a VB6 or Access application (2.0 right up to 2007) instead of asking yourself Whats next?, ask us!<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              SageKey has been working with and developing software for the Yellow Pages Industry since 2004. Our close involvment with the industry has lead us to having an in-depth understanding of its needs and business that few can match.<br>
<br>
Some of the projects we&#39;ve been involved with include YPA IRIS ONLINE, <br>
YPA CO-OP ONLINE, the YPA IRIS-based Web Service and the automated indexing of Yellow Pages headings.<br>
<br>
In 2004 the Yellow Pages Association asked SageKey to build a complex ASP.Net web-based application with the same functionality as their existing CD application. Both the timeframe and budget for the project were tight.<br>
<br>
SageKey put a three-person team on the project and delivered on time and on budget. The application was presented at a national convention a week later to rave reviews.<br>
<br>

12 years ago I stumbled upon a small vendor on the web. Today we no longer have a vendor, but a strategic partner in all of our development efforts. With projects ranging from simple installation scripts to industry wide web-based applications, SageKey has exceeded our expectations in every instance. Working with SageKey is not something that can be described, it is something that must be experienced.<br>
