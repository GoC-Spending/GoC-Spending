                            This kit consists mainly of two tablet devices which are configured to connect either directly to each other or through a WiFi access point to provide text-based chat between a person with hearing loss and a hearing person, without involving an Internet connection.  The tablets can be worn in a shoulder holster provided for complete mobility while working or learning.  One typical use is for a hearing employer to communicate with an employee with hearing loss at a distance, without the need for face-to-face contact for writing notes on paper.  Another typical use is for a Learning Assistant to communicate with a student who either has hearing loss or a learning disability without the need for them to sit side-by-side to write notes on paper, or communicate in some other way - the Learning Assistant can sit at the back of the class or other location, giving the student the freedom to move about while still having text-based chat access to the Learning Assistant.  This kit is far more mobile and much less expensive than a similar kit that uses two &#39;netbook&#39; computers.<br>

                            Mobile Software-Hardware Enhanced for Training and Work (MoSHEn-TW) is a kit designed for individuals with a learning disability that has made it difficult or impossible for them to become skillful learners of common computer technology such as would be used in a place of business.  The kit contains both mobile and stationary components for the user to experience a typical work setup with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but also have the mobility to use the main component anywhere.  The main component consists of an 8-inch tablet device specially configured to provide a typical business computing environment (Windows 7 and 8.1, Office 2010 and/or Office 2013) along with tips, memory aids, minders/reminders, timers/alarms, etc. to keep the student/worker organized and efficient.  CapComm&#39;s specialized training program that we refer to as &quot;Triple R&quot; is recommended in the case of an individual who has very little to no hands-on experience with computer technology.<br>

                            The Office Communications Kit for the Visually Impaired (TOCK-VI) is a kit designed to meet the array of needs faced by an office worker who is blind or otherwise visually impaired.  The kit provides the user with mobile access to office computer environments and software making use of top-of-the-line screen reader technology with the option to also operate the computer and interact with software and produce typewritten material through voice control (speech recognition).  The main difference between TOCK-VI and traditional methods for accommodating blind or visually impaired individuals in the office environment is the complete mobility of the solution, while also providing traditional access to the network, and even remote access to office computers, all controlled by voice input and output.  The kit comes completely configured and may also include custom settings as requested or required.<br>

                            RCS mainly caters to post-secondary educational institutes allowing an individual with hearing loss to attend a venue (classroom, meeting, etc.) and see what is being spoken as streaming text in real time on a mobile device or laptop.  This is similar to a service known as CART which is performed by certified court reporters, but is much less expensive due to CapComm&#39;s unique technologies (we do not use the technologies used by CART).  RCS is about half the cost of CART in some areas, is entirely remote, and allows the student to sit where she wishes in the classroom, and to move about the classroom, lab, or shop while viewing what&#39;s being said on the tablet screen.  There is nothing to purchase as this service is based on an hourly fee, and discounting is available in some situations.  Contact us for more information, or to book a demonstration.  Note that RCS and similar CapComm services may be suitable for accommodating students with certain learning disabilities, to help them keep their focus and quickly review what was missed while attention drifted.<br>

                            Triple R (Rapid Repetition Retention) is a highly specialized training method to help individuals with certain learning disabilities to learn either standard business technologies or assistive technologies (AT) needed for their learning and/or work environments.  Some individuals who are considered  &#39;computer-illiterate&#39; (or &#39;technophobes&#39;) have a learning disability that makes it very difficult for them to learn, understand, and remember technical terms, actions, processes, and methods.  This may be a barrier to post-secondary education or to employment, typically preventing normal operation of computer and related technologies.  Triple R training addresses these issues with customized and specialized training in a relaxed and understanding one-on-one environment, and may be covered by a &#39;success guarantee&#39; contact us for details.<br>

                            CapComm&#39;s Assistive (or Adaptive) Technology Assessments (ATAs) set a high standard in determining the best specialized technologies and training needed to help an individual with a learning or physical disability function in their educational or work environments to the best possible level.  Traditionally, ATAs are relatively brief, and the solutions offered are basic and have no long-term follow-up to ensure success.  CapComm provides ATA services that may involve two or more in-person interviews (preliminary assessment meetings), on-site assessment visits, Assistive/Adaptive Technology (AT) demonstrations, etc.  This is part of our holistic approach to the assessment process, trying to identify the individual&#39;s areas of weakness in their time management, task and workflow management, computer efficiency, and even attitudes, thinking patterns, and other needs that go beyond a simple identification of helpful tech; if the additional issues are not addressed in this process, resulting AT and training may fall far short of expectations over the long term. When AT is approved by the funder, CapComm provides personalized training along with a follow-up program that can last almost a year to ensure the long-term success and use of the AT and training provided.  In combination with our BATT-R-UP Training &amp; Coaching, the goal of the individual having long-term access to education and employment on-par with their peers can become a reality. CapComm guarantees its ATAs, training and coaching methods in writing.  To our knowledge, our ATAs are the most holistic, comprehensive, and have the greatest opportunity for success.<br>

                            BATT-R-UP (Beyond Assistive Technology Training for Resiliency and Universal Productivity) is a training program that may be included as a recommendation in an ATA (Assistive Technology Assessment).  The long-term success of individuals who have received an assessment and resulting technology and training has simply fallen far short of expectations.  Often the reason is not necessarily a poor match of AT to the individual&#39;s needs, but a failure to take a holistic approach to the assessment and training.  Many individuals who can benefit from AT also have a need to learn and utilize time management tools and techniques, learn how to work with software and computer Operating Systems efficiently and quickly, and how to manage tasks and workloads while keeping stress at manageable levels.  BATT-R-UP Training &amp; Coaching addresses these overlooked areas and begins with CapComm&#39;s comprehensive and holistic AT Assessments.  We also guarantee in writing the success of our training and coaching methods with some conditions.<br>

                            This kit consists mainly of two tablet devices which are configured to connect either directly to each other or through a WiFi access point to provide text-based chat between a person with hearing loss and a hearing person, without involving an Internet connection.  The tablets can be worn in a shoulder holster provided for complete mobility while working or learning.  One typical use is for a hearing employer to communicate with an employee with hearing loss at a distance, without the need for face-to-face contact for writing notes on paper.  Another typical use is for a Learning Assistant to communicate with a student who either has hearing loss or a learning disability without the need for them to sit side-by-side to write notes on paper, or communicate in some other way - the Learning Assistant can sit at the back of the class or other location, giving the student the freedom to move about while still having text-based chat access to the Learning Assistant.  This kit is far more mobile and much less expensive than a similar kit that uses two &#39;netbook&#39; computers.<br>

                            Mobile Software-Hardware Enhanced for Training and Work (MoSHEn-TW) is a kit designed for individuals with a learning disability that has made it difficult or impossible for them to become skillful learners of common computer technology such as would be used in a place of business.  The kit contains both mobile and stationary components for the user to experience a typical work setup with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but also have the mobility to use the main component anywhere.  The main component consists of an 8-inch tablet device specially configured to provide a typical business computing environment (Windows 7 and 8.1, Office 2010 and/or Office 2013) along with tips, memory aids, minders/reminders, timers/alarms, etc. to keep the student/worker organized and efficient.  CapComm&#39;s specialized training program that we refer to as &quot;Triple R&quot; is recommended in the case of an individual who has very little to no hands-on experience with computer technology.<br>

                            The Office Communications Kit for the Visually Impaired (TOCK-VI) is a kit designed to meet the array of needs faced by an office worker who is blind or otherwise visually impaired.  The kit provides the user with mobile access to office computer environments and software making use of top-of-the-line screen reader technology with the option to also operate the computer and interact with software and produce typewritten material through voice control (speech recognition).  The main difference between TOCK-VI and traditional methods for accommodating blind or visually impaired individuals in the office environment is the complete mobility of the solution, while also providing traditional access to the network, and even remote access to office computers, all controlled by voice input and output.  The kit comes completely configured and may also include custom settings as requested or required.<br>

                            RCS mainly caters to post-secondary educational institutes allowing an individual with hearing loss to attend a venue (classroom, meeting, etc.) and see what is being spoken as streaming text in real time on a mobile device or laptop.  This is similar to a service known as CART which is performed by certified court reporters, but is much less expensive due to CapComm&#39;s unique technologies (we do not use the technologies used by CART).  RCS is about half the cost of CART in some areas, is entirely remote, and allows the student to sit where she wishes in the classroom, and to move about the classroom, lab, or shop while viewing what&#39;s being said on the tablet screen.  There is nothing to purchase as this service is based on an hourly fee, and discounting is available in some situations.  Contact us for more information, or to book a demonstration.  Note that RCS and similar CapComm services may be suitable for accommodating students with certain learning disabilities, to help them keep their focus and quickly review what was missed while attention drifted.<br>

                            Triple R (Rapid Repetition Retention) is a highly specialized training method to help individuals with certain learning disabilities to learn either standard business technologies or assistive technologies (AT) needed for their learning and/or work environments.  Some individuals who are considered  &#39;computer-illiterate&#39; (or &#39;technophobes&#39;) have a learning disability that makes it very difficult for them to learn, understand, and remember technical terms, actions, processes, and methods.  This may be a barrier to post-secondary education or to employment, typically preventing normal operation of computer and related technologies.  Triple R training addresses these issues with customized and specialized training in a relaxed and understanding one-on-one environment, and may be covered by a &#39;success guarantee&#39; contact us for details.<br>

                            CapComm&#39;s Assistive (or Adaptive) Technology Assessments (ATAs) set a high standard in determining the best specialized technologies and training needed to help an individual with a learning or physical disability function in their educational or work environments to the best possible level.  Traditionally, ATAs are relatively brief, and the solutions offered are basic and have no long-term follow-up to ensure success.  CapComm provides ATA services that may involve two or more in-person interviews (preliminary assessment meetings), on-site assessment visits, Assistive/Adaptive Technology (AT) demonstrations, etc.  This is part of our holistic approach to the assessment process, trying to identify the individual&#39;s areas of weakness in their time management, task and workflow management, computer efficiency, and even attitudes, thinking patterns, and other needs that go beyond a simple identification of helpful tech; if the additional issues are not addressed in this process, resulting AT and training may fall far short of expectations over the long term. When AT is approved by the funder, CapComm provides personalized training along with a follow-up program that can last almost a year to ensure the long-term success and use of the AT and training provided.  In combination with our BATT-R-UP Training &amp; Coaching, the goal of the individual having long-term access to education and employment on-par with their peers can become a reality. CapComm guarantees its ATAs, training and coaching methods in writing.  To our knowledge, our ATAs are the most holistic, comprehensive, and have the greatest opportunity for success.<br>

                            BATT-R-UP (Beyond Assistive Technology Training for Resiliency and Universal Productivity) is a training program that may be included as a recommendation in an ATA (Assistive Technology Assessment).  The long-term success of individuals who have received an assessment and resulting technology and training has simply fallen far short of expectations.  Often the reason is not necessarily a poor match of AT to the individual&#39;s needs, but a failure to take a holistic approach to the assessment and training.  Many individuals who can benefit from AT also have a need to learn and utilize time management tools and techniques, learn how to work with software and computer Operating Systems efficiently and quickly, and how to manage tasks and workloads while keeping stress at manageable levels.  BATT-R-UP Training &amp; Coaching addresses these overlooked areas and begins with CapComm&#39;s comprehensive and holistic AT Assessments.
