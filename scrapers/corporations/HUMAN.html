              </h4>
          
              &quot; I found Mike Hart to be fully professional in the manner that he conducts himself and in how he conducts his business.  He is open, up front and thorough and, as a result, I experience no (nor expect any) surprises or disappointments.&quot; - Mike Renouf, Water Survey of Canada, Environment Canada<br>
<br>
&quot;You taught us a new way of thinking, looking at our system from a totally fresh perspective and really thinking for the first time what it is we do and how we do it. The benefits from this analysis were immediately apparent. For the first time, the IGMA staff operates as a team. I personally would not have thought that possible nor would it have been without you.&quot; - Margaret Webb, Insulating Glass Manufacturers Alliance (IGMA)<br>

I continue to stand by that comment.  - Darryl Lynch, Aviation Division, Environment Canada<br>

I continue to stand by that comment.  - Darryl Lynch, Aviation Division, Environment Canada<br>
