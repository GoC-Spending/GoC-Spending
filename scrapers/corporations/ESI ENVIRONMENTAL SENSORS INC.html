        <br>            E.S.I. Environmental Sensors Inc. is an established <br>environmental technology company based in Victoria, British <br>Columbia.  The Company&#39;s principal focus has been the <br>development, manufacture and marketing of environmental <br>instruments.  The company is broadening its scope of operations <br>to provide systems based solutions for soil and water <br>management.  ESI is currently organized around its moisture monitoring technology.<br><br>Moisture Infiltration Monitoring Division<br><br>1. GRO.POINT family of products are rugged, portable, and easy to use product line <br>that is specifically designed so that farmers and commercial <br>growers can optimize irrigation programs.  This in turn <br>maximizes yield and crop quality, saving water, energy and <br>improving farm profitability.  <br>GRO.POINT is currently being integrated into a line of state-of-<br>the-art irrigation control systems so that the operator may <br>manage crop irrigation manually, or select options leading to a <br>fully automated system.<br><br>2. MOISTURE.POINT is an award winning soil moisture monitoring <br>system using a patented TDR  (Time Domain Reflectometry) <br>technology.  MOISTURE.POINT is unique in that it provides <br>simultaneous and extremely precise monitoring of moisture levels <br>at up to seven different depths with a single probe.  No other <br>instrument can make this claim, and there are MOISTURE.POINT <br>systems operating in over 30 countries around the world. <br>Applications where these systems are being used include:<br><br>* Landfills, remediated and hazardous waste sites, roadways, <br>farms, and airports, are major sources of groundwater <br>contamination.  MOISTURE.POINT systems are used to monitor <br>moisture levels and their role in the transport of toxins into <br>water systems such as rivers, lakes, and aquifers.<br><br>* Floods, water-borne erosion, and landslides, cause major <br>disruptions around the world. MOISTURE.POINT systems are being <br>used in several countries for, determining riverbank stability, <br>and monitoring slopes prone to landslides.<br><br>* Forestry is evolving from simply cutting down trees, to <br>dynamic management of a renewable resource.  MOISTURE.POINT <br>systems are being used by both scientific organizations to <br>enhance the existing knowledge base on tree-growth and watershed <br>management, and by forestry companies who wish to grow tree <br>seedlings in the most efficient manner possible.  Commercial <br>interests also use MOISTURE.POINT to determine a forests lumber <br>production potential, by monitoring water take-up and <br>subsequent tree growth rates. <br><br>            On-going Research and Development<br><br>ESI has developed a new instrument, FloPoint,  that measures to a <br>high degree of accuracy the water cut of a producing oil well.  <br>This device, which uses a proprietary technology exclusive to <br>the Company, has the potential to be installed in a significant <br>number of the worlds oil wells, and in pipelines.  Early sales have been made in Canada, USA and Russia. FloPoint can significantly reduce the production cost to take oil from the ground, as well, it can identify the point at which an oil well becomes uneconomic, and should cease production.   <br><br><br><br>

                            MOISTURE.POINT® an accurate, contiguous moisture profile in <br>
landfill closure covers.<br>
 <br>
Given that the flow of moisture in an unsaturated material, such <br>
as a landfill cover, can be in any direction... <br>
* What is really happening within the vertical profile of the <br>
cover? <br>
* Is lateral flow occurring in an area where two different <br>
materials interface? <br>
* Is there any moisture moving upward from the landfill waste? <br>
* If moisture is moving both down from the surface and up from <br>
the waste, how can one tell if, when and where these two wetting <br>
fronts meet? <br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® provides clear answers to the above questions <br>
and more.  Through its proprietary multi-segment probe design, <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® provides an uninterrupted vertical profile of <br>
soil moisture.  By contrast, other systems utilizing individual <br>
sensors can only sample a series of disconnected points in the <br>
landfill cover.  In addition to its monitoring advantages, <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® can also be installed with minimal disturbance <br>
to the landfill cover itself, ensuring that data collected by <br>
the profiling probes truly reflects what is occurring in the <br>
surrounding area.<br>

Mining Reclamation<br>
University of Kentucky, USA<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® offers mined-out areas a unique chance for <br>
reclamation and eventual reforestation.<br>
<br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/mine-app.htm<br>
<br>
The physical, biological and hydraulic properties of soil, and <br>
the development of an ecologically diverse soil profile are <br>
central to plant growth and survival as well as ecosystem <br>
development.  The mountaintop removal process to mine coal, which <br>
is widely practiced in the Appalachian coal region, is very <br>
destructive to forest ecosystems.  Success of reclamation efforts <br>
in this region depends on the rate of ecosystem development and <br>
soil productivity of the mine spoil. <br>
<br>
The University of Kentucky is studying mine reclamation for <br>
ecosystem development.  One measure of ecosystem development for <br>
this experiment is the capability of the soil profile to develop <br>
into a material that can hold and transmit water.  Using the <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® system, replicate plots are monitored bi-weekly <br>
to assess vertical distributions of water within the upper 30 cm <br>
of the soil profile. Water storage measured with the <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® system is compared to the computed available <br>
water from the soil-water retention curves.  A mass balance <br>
computed at the soil surface and within the upper 30 cm of the <br>
soil is compared to precipitation, and evapo-transpiration to <br>
computer percolation below the surface horizon.<br>
 <br>
Water content within the rooting zone is important for tree and <br>
microbial population survival.  Water transport characteristics <br>
such as total porosity, drainable porosity, field capacity, <br>
wilting point and infiltration capacity are used to calculate <br>
the available water in the soil profile. <br>

                            Engineers, hydrologists and geologists require detailed moisture <br>
content data to properly evaluate soil stability. <br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® monitoring systems enable these professionals to <br>
analyze soil conditions with a high degree of accuracy, and make <br>
their recommendations with confidence.<br>
 <br>
Current applications of MOISTURE.POINT® in the Civil Engineering <br>
field include: <br>
* Development and design of water resources and irrigation <br>
drainage systems; <br>
* Moisture monitoring under structures; <br>
* Moisture monitoring in earth-filled dams; <br>
* Disaster prediction research related to topographical changes; <br>
* Analysis of sand arrestation and coastline protection/erosion; <br>
* Analysis of changeable water flow affected by melting snow; <br>
* Determination of water penetration and evaporation from soils; <br>
* Moisture monitoring in cement and cement building materials. <br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®&#39;s primary advantages are:<br>
* Installation of the system is simple, inexpensive, and with <br>
minimal site disturbance - no site excavation work is required, <br>
and data obtained represents an accurate reflection of the <br>
surrounding soil.<br>
* The system is extremely durable - even for extended periods of <br>
time under the worst climatic conditions. <br>
* MOISTURE.POINT® data is easily collected on-site or remotely <br>
using conventional acquisition techniques and communications <br>
methods (including cellular).  MOISTURE.POINT® systems include a <br>
standard RS232 port for access to raw data, waveform display and <br>
system settings via personal computer. <br>
<br>
Following is a selection of typical MOISTURE.POINT® applications <br>
in the field of civil engineering.<br>
<br>
Airport Groundwater Monitoring<br>
Gardermoen Airport, Norway <br>
<br>
Norway&#39;s use of MOISTURE.POINT® may be significant first step to <br>
international information transfer on protection of groundwater <br>
resources. <br>
<br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/air-app.htm<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® systems are being used at the new Gardermoen <br>
Airport in Norway as part of a national study designed to <br>
provide a model of pollutant transportation and establish <br>
remedial actions against spreading of pollutants from the <br>
airport to the groundwater. <br>
<br>
Since the airport is situated on top of Norway&#39;s only clean <br>
underground freshwater aquifer, it is critical to understand the <br>
environmental impacts of the new airport on the subsurface.  The <br>
surrounding land has diagonal soil layers comprised of different <br>
materials, with an approximate slope of 15 degrees.  This slope <br>
could result in flow rates that significantly differ from the <br>
water infiltration models they had previously devised.  The <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  multiplexed system was installed to validate <br>
the flow models that have been designed, and to better <br>
understand the impact of potential airport-related groundwater <br>
contaminants. <br>
<br>
The Gardermoen Project is part of an extensive national project <br>
to increase understanding of how contaminants are bound and <br>
degraded in soil and groundwater, and thus to understand and <br>
predict their behaviour and spread.  The study is also looking at <br>
the effects of contaminants on the natural processes in the soil <br>
and at the interaction with global biogeochemical cycles.  The <br>
objective of the program is to further strengthen Norwegian <br>
expertise in contaminant hydrogeology.  This expertise will <br>
enable Norwegians to supply industry and governmental agencies <br>
around the world with knowledge to develop new technologies and <br>
guidelines to protect groundwater resources and remediate <br>
contaminated soil and aquifers. <br>
<br>
<br>
Heavy Vehicle Traffic<br>
Puerto Rico and Vicksburg, Mississippi<br>
<br>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the Waterways Experimental <br>
Station in Vicksburg, Mississippi is developing a soil moisture <br>
chart for heavy vehicle operators.  The chart will indicate how <br>
much precipitation the soil can withstand before vehicles cannot <br>
be driven across the surface and how long after the <br>
precipitation before vehicles can be driven again.  The study <br>
includes monitoring of soil moisture, soil strength, and <br>
precipitation events for a variety of soil types. <br>
<br>
Two MOISTURE.POINT®  instruments and Type K profiling probes (4Ó <br>
x 6Ó) are being used.  Phase I of the project was conducted in <br>
Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has diverse topography, soil types and <br>
micro-climatic regions, all within close geographic proximity, <br>
making it an ideal location for this type of study.  Soil <br>
moisture, weather station and soil strength data were collected <br>
from February until June of 1997.  The MOISTURE.POINT® system <br>
provided excellent results. <br>
<br>
In August 1997, the experiment was moved to Vicksburg, <br>
Mississippi, where the soil moisture, weather station and soil <br>
compaction data from Puerto Rico was also being analyzed. <br>
Throughout the remainder of the summer and fall, the study <br>
looked at the relationship between heavy vehicle traffic and <br>
soil moisture in a variety of sand, silt and silty loam soils <br>
along the banks of the Mississippi River.<br>
<br>
Road Monitoring<br>
Tennessee, U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Researchers in the Agricultural Engineering and Civil <br>
Engineering Departments of an American University are using <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  to monitor substrate water content below <br>
asphaltic concrete pavement.  The objective of the research is to <br>
demonstrate the seasonal variation in water content and <br>
temperature in pavement substrates, and to measure the effects <br>
of these variations on pavement performance.  Three test sites <br>
have been selected for this study, representing the range of <br>
environmental and geotechnical conditions that exist across <br>
Tennessee.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  profiling probes have been placed horizontally <br>
in the soil substrate, stone substrate and asphalt stabilized <br>
base layer beneath the outer wheel path of the roadway.  The <br>
installation was done from a trench constructed in the shoulder <br>
of the road.  These profiling probes will allow monitoring of a <br>
wetting front moving horizontally in the substrate. <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  single segment probes have been placed in the <br>
asphaltic concrete, installed during construction, before the <br>
material cooled. <br>
<br>
At each site, rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind <br>
speed, and solar radiation will be monitored.  Temperature <br>
sensors have been placed in the asphalt concrete through a core <br>
hole.  Non-destructive Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests <br>
will be periodically performed at each site to correlate <br>
pavement performance with environmental conditions.  This will <br>
permit direct observation of the effects of substrate water <br>
content variations on pavement performance.<br>
<br>
A MOISTURE.POINT®  multiplexed datalogging system has been <br>
installed in a metal enclosure inside a concrete vault outside <br>
the roadway shoulder at each site.  The system will collect data <br>
from the probes, substrate and pavement temperature sensors, <br>
rainfall tipping buckets and other climatological sensors.<br>
<br>
Atmospheric Research<br>
Kansas, U.S.A.<br>
<br>
The Argonne Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE) is a new research <br>
initiative devoted to addressing a myriad of unresolved <br>
fundamental questions in atmospheric research.  The initial focus <br>
of ABLE will be measurements of the planetary boundary layer <br>
where most interactions between the atmosphere and humans take <br>
place. Many important scientific issues are being addressed <br>
including natural disaster reduction, public safety, and water <br>
resource management.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  is being used in one study to better understand <br>
the relationship between soil moisture, soil hydraulic processes <br>
and precipitation length scales.  A total of 16 sites will be <br>
monitored using MOISTURE.POINT® five-segment profiling probes <br>
in the Towanda Sub-basin of Kansas.  Spacing between the probes <br>
will be approximately 10m along a transect to obtain a two-<br>
dimensional representation of soil/water dynamics.  The full <br>
installation will be composed of two eight-probe transects <br>
placed in a cross pattern. <br>
<br>
Temperature measurements will be made at three depths in the <br>
proximity of each probe to be used primarily for temperature <br>
corrections.  Remote access to the automated system will be <br>
provided through the use of a cellular telephone modem link to <br>
allow for data retrieval and continuous site monitoring. Rain <br>
gauges will be installed to record date and time of each <br>
precipitation event.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  was selected for this study by researchers from <br>
Oregon State University because two similar systems had already <br>
been successfully deployed in the Boreal Ecosystem and <br>
Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) to monitor soil moisture.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® was selected to provide the moisture measurement <br>
data for these studies because of its unique features, including <br>
profiling of moisture at different depths with minimal soil <br>
disturbance; easy installation and relocation; and performance <br>
in different soil types. <br>

accurately measure horizontal and vertical soil moisture <br>
profiles - with virtually no disturbance to existing soil <br>
horizons. <br>
<br>
In the fields of agriculture, silviculture and irrigation, <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® has numerous possible applications, including: <br>
* Determining correlations between soil moisture and other <br>
environmental variables on plant growth; <br>
* Accurately differentiating the moisture requirements between <br>
plant species; <br>
* Determining irrigation routines that provide an optimal root <br>
environment for balanced plant growth; <br>
* Determining irrigation routines that maximize water <br>
conservation.<br>
*  Analyzing the distribution effectiveness of irrigation <br>
systems; <br>
<br>
Below is a selection of typical Moisture·Point® applications in <br>
agriculture, silviculture, and irrigation. <br>
<br>
1. Agriculture<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® systems make it possible to conduct innovative <br>
and valuable agricultural research around the world.<br>
 <br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/agri-app.htm<br>
<br>
In each of the following applications, MOISTURE.POINT® offers <br>
researchers the unique ability to monitor a vertical soil <br>
moisture profile.  This can be accomplished with virtually no <br>
disturbance to existing soil horizons and, with an unparalleled <br>
degree of resolution in TDR-based data collection. <br>
<br>
Microspray Irrigation Management Study<br>
USDA-ARS, California <br>
<br>
Researchers are studying the effects of a microspray irrigation <br>
system on soil moisture distribution near large walnut tree root <br>
systems, versus in open areas.  The correlation between soil <br>
moisture levels, soil pests and their control is also being <br>
studied. The trial is being replicated over five years in order <br>
to evaluate the long term impacts and the success of this <br>
irrigation management technique. <br>
The flexibility and ease of installation of the MOISTURE.POINT® <br>
system has allowed researchers to obtain moisture level <br>
information in and around large root systems, providing accurate <br>
data collection in confined areas. <br>
<br>
Study of Impact of Greenhouse Effect on Water Availability<br>
Department of Geography, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland<br>
 <br>
Researchers in Switzerland are currently studying the impact of <br>
the greenhouse effect on water availability for plants. <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  systems are being used to measure soil moisture <br>
data for this study.  Fifty one-square-metre cells with one-third <br>
of metre Plexiglas walls and a lid have been positioned on a <br>
steep slope with a southern exposure.  Inside each cell, the <br>
atmosphere is artificially augmented with C02 delivered through <br>
a perforated conduit system.  This artificial atmosphere is <br>
designed to emulate the atmosphere a few decades from now, based <br>
on the current C02 rate of increase.<br>
 <br>
The cells are equipped with C02, 02 and temperature sensors.  A <br>
circular antenna laid on the soil in each cell emits a frequency <br>
that brings earthworms to the surface.  Counting the worms in <br>
each cell permits an assessment of the biological activity of <br>
the soil. <br>
<br>
Until recently, the study did not include accurate soil moisture <br>
data as the researchers had been unable to find probes suitable <br>
to this application.  To be effective, the probes had to be <br>
installed in the soil to a depth of one metre without causing <br>
major disruption to the soil structure.  Also, the probes had to <br>
be installed with little available surface area given the <br>
existing suite of sensors.  MOISTURE.POINT® was selected for its <br>
unique ability to meet these requirements. <br>
<br>
Assessment of Water Retention of Farm Fields under Varying <br>
Tillage Techniques<br>
Charlottetown Research Centre (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada)<br>
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island <br>
<br>
At this facility, researchers are using MOISTURE.POINT® to <br>
assess the water retention characteristics of farm fields under <br>
varying tillage techniques, with a focus on conservation <br>
tillage.  This technique allows the residual mulch from potato <br>
plants to remain in the top soil layer, which is believed to <br>
reduce evapo-transpirative loss.  At the same time, it is <br>
theorized that conservation tillage facilitates rapid water <br>
infiltration during irrigation or precipitation events.<br>
<br>
2. Silviculture<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® makes it possible to increase growth and yield, <br>
while saving on water, power and fertilizer.<br>
<br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/silv-app.htm<br>
<br>
Tree nurseries are increasingly using new techniques, such as <br>
large potted seedlings and air-slit containers, in their effort <br>
to cultivate strong, healthy plants with well-developed root <br>
structures.  Although it has been proven that irrigation <br>
techniques play a critical role in seedling physiology, <br>
traditional approaches to determining seasonal soil water <br>
requirements during the growth period have been typically <br>
qualitative.  There has not been a quick, accurate means of <br>
measuring the water content in the potting medium (comprised of <br>
peat, vermiculite and sand)...until the development of <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®.  This is the first system to provide routine, <br>
precise volumetric moisture monitoring capability in a broad <br>
range of soils, including peat and other porous media used in <br>
greenhouse cultivation.<br>
 <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® provides the empirical data necessary for <br>
greenhouse specialists to establish effective irrigation <br>
routines that optimize growth and yield in their nursery. <br>
Greenhouse specialists can monitor water content of their soils <br>
in &quot;real-time&quot;, and irrigation can easily designed to <br>
accommodate seasonal conditions, tree species and planting media <br>
variations.<br>
 <br>
Measuring Moisture Content in Peat Substrates <br>
Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources, Canada <br>
<br>
A recent study was undertaken by the Quebec Ministry of Natural <br>
Resources in which water content was measured three times per <br>
week, using 24 probes in peat substrates within the tree <br>
production greenhouses.  The MOISTURE.POINT® system was used to <br>
determine moisture levels in several small containers by <br>
arranging one long single-diode probe to pass through several of <br>
the containers. Moisture·Point® provided reliable measurement of <br>
water content in peat and vermiculite potting mixes with an <br>
average accuracy of better than 3%, reproducible from week to <br>
week.  As well, ministry greenhouse staff were able to maintain <br>
preset moisture levels.<br>
<br>
3. Irrigation <br>
<br>
Successful use of MOISTURE.POINT® in raspberry farming allows <br>
for accurate scheduling of irrigation and saves 10 percent in <br>
watering costs for the season.<br>
<br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/irig-app.htm<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® systems were installed in established raspberry <br>
fields near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  The region has <br>
an annual moisture deficit of approximately 432-mm per growing <br>
season and raspberries must be irrigated to achieve optimum <br>
production.<br>
 <br>
The farm currently has two types of irrigation systems - a hand-<br>
moved sprinkler system in one field and a trickle system in a <br>
second field.  Moisture monitoring equipment was used in both <br>
fields to determine the effectiveness of the irrigation to <br>
develop new watering schedules to save water. <br>
<br>
One probe was installed in the sprinkler-irrigated field in the <br>
row line of the raspberry plants.  In the trickle irrigated <br>
field, two probes were installed, one in the row midway between <br>
two point-source emitters and the other probe between the <br>
raspberry rows, approximately 1.5 metres from the emitters. <br>
The moisture data were recorded along with the time of day and <br>
weather conditions.  Initially, readings were taken at three-to <br>
four-day intervals and then at closer intervals near sprinkler <br>
irrigation times. <br>
<br>
The sprinkler irrigation system was initially operated on a <br>
timed schedule that was independent of soil moisture levels. <br>
After the first two cycles of operation, the maximum soil <br>
moisture levels for different depths were determined.  Similarly, <br>
minimum moisture levels to sustain food crop production were <br>
established.  This enabled sprinkler irrigation scheduling to be <br>
planned based on safe moisture levels, rather than on time.  The <br>
user claims that the instrument not only saved water due to more <br>
accurate scheduling knowledge, but it also saved 10% of the cost <br>
of the irrigation water for the season.<br>

stand-alone basis, or is easily integrated into an ESI or other <br>
automated irrigation control system. <br>
<br>
Designed and developed by ESI, GRO.POINT is a cost-effective <br>
soil moisture-sensing instrument that provides accurate <br>
measurement of soil moisture by volume.  GRO.POINT uses a <br>
refined TDT technology that was specifically developed to <br>
provide growers with the management information that is required <br>
to enable them to: <br>
* obtain higher yields<br>
* grow better quality crops<br>
* optimize water use<br>
* reduce excessive leaching. <br>
<br>
Manufactured in stainless steel with all interfaces sealed in <br>
epoxy, the GRO.POINT soil moisture instrument will provide <br>

                            MOISTURE.POINT® offers powerful decision support for alternative <br>
landfill cover validation<br>
<br>
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <br>
maintains stringent regulations regarding the final cover of a <br>
closed landfill.  The intent of their &quot;Subtitle D&quot; prescriptive <br>
final closure is to create a cover which will eliminate water <br>
infiltration and minimize erosion. <br>
<br>
The EPA&#39;s prescribed cover includes a 6 inch &quot;erosion layer&quot;, <br>
designed to support native vegetation, directly above an 18 inch <br>
low-permeability &quot;infiltration layer&quot;, commonly composed of clay <br>
or bentonite.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Solid Waste Landfill Closures <br>
<br>
In many parts of the United States, clay or bentonite is not <br>
locally available. To meet the EPA&#39;s prescribed landfill cover <br>
definition in these regions, these infiltration layer materials <br>
must be acquired and transported from other regions, at great <br>
cost.  An additional problem with both clay and bentonite is that <br>
they are liable to crack and desiccate in arid regions, thus <br>
undermining the integrity of the cap. <br>
<br>
Alternative / Monolithic Cover Designs <br>
<br>
Motivated by the above financial and operational incentives, <br>
many cities, municipalities and landfill operators are looking <br>
to close their solid waste landfills with an alternative final <br>
cover.  The monolithic approach, a final cover design comprised <br>
of compacted locally available, low-permeability soil, is <br>
quickly gaining acceptance at all levels, including government <br>
regulators, environmental engineering firms and end users.  The <br>
net benefits are (1) significant cost advantages over the <br>
prescribed cover design, and (2) reduced operational concerns in <br>
terms of cover implementation and maintenance. <br>
<br>
Implementation of an alternative landfill cover design requires <br>
approval by government regulators.  A prerequisite of the <br>
approval process is validation of the integrity of the cover; <br>
i.e.: Is it working? If a moisture monitoring system is required <br>
to validate the performance of the alternative final cover, <br>
E.S.I. Environmental Sensors Inc.&#39;s MOISTURE.POINT® provides the <br>
solution. <br>

<br>
Regulations have been developed in the United States to define a <br>
cover design for landfill closures that provides an impervious <br>
barrier to surface moisture infiltration and thus prevents <br>
contamination of the groundwater.  The regulations recognize that <br>
regional variations may not suit the prescribed cover design, <br>
and an allowance for alternative designs is included. <br>
<br>
Alternative designs must pass a rigorous approval process. <br>
Covers usually include the construction of a clay layer, which <br>
is prone to desiccation and cracking in arid climates.  When this <br>
happens, the clay layer allows water to penetrate through it. <br>
Alternative cover designs must maintain an unsaturated profile <br>
inhibiting breakthrough and, where appropriate, enhancing evapo-<br>
transpiration with native plant species. <br>
<br>
A MOISTURE.POINT® Landfill Monitoring System incorporates ESI&#39;s <br>
patented multi-segment profiling probes together with a full <br>
suite of meteorological sensors to provide a complete monitoring <br>
system for alternative landfill cover validation.  The probes are <br>
installed vertically from the surface with minimal soil <br>
disturbance.  Additional system options include solar power and <br>
cellular modem for remote, unattended operation and data <br>
communications.  The system is easy to use and provides reliable <br>
moisture data in contiguous profiles with minimal site impact.  <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® has little calibration sensitivity to variations <br>
in soil structure, and provides a predictable response to <br>
variations in soil conductivity, soil structure and <br>
permeability.  In addition, MOISTURE.POINT® allows for post-<br>
construction sensor installation without disturbing the soil <br>
profile. <br>
<br>
In a recent application in the State of Arizona, an alternative <br>
test cover study has been implemented with a goal of <br>
demonstrating that an effective alternative cover can be <br>
constructed using locally available silty sand soils. <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® was selected to provide the data necessary to <br>
validate the effectiveness of the alternative cover design.<br>
<br>
The focus of the study is on two one-acre test covers <br>
constructed at the landfill.  Each test cover has a dedicated, <br>
multiplexed soil moisture monitoring system, housed in a <br>
weatherproof enclosure, located in a central location on the <br>
test cover.  Each test cover contains 29 soil moisture-sensing <br>
probes, each providing readings at five different depths. <br>
<br>
The data allows regulators from the Arizona Department of <br>
Environmental Quality to assess whether or not the test covers <br>
meet the requirement of the regulations.<br>

                            MOISTURE.POINT® an accurate, contiguous moisture profile in <br>
landfill closure covers.<br>
 <br>
Given that the flow of moisture in an unsaturated material, such <br>
as a landfill cover, can be in any direction... <br>
* What is really happening within the vertical profile of the <br>
cover? <br>
* Is lateral flow occurring in an area where two different <br>
materials interface? <br>
* Is there any moisture moving upward from the landfill waste? <br>
* If moisture is moving both down from the surface and up from <br>
the waste, how can one tell if, when and where these two wetting <br>
fronts meet? <br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® provides clear answers to the above questions <br>
and more.  Through its proprietary multi-segment probe design, <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® provides an uninterrupted vertical profile of <br>
soil moisture.  By contrast, other systems utilizing individual <br>
sensors can only sample a series of disconnected points in the <br>
landfill cover.  In addition to its monitoring advantages, <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® can also be installed with minimal disturbance <br>
to the landfill cover itself, ensuring that data collected by <br>
the profiling probes truly reflects what is occurring in the <br>
surrounding area.<br>

Mining Reclamation<br>
University of Kentucky, USA<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® offers mined-out areas a unique chance for <br>
reclamation and eventual reforestation.<br>

<br>
The physical, biological and hydraulic properties of soil, and <br>
the development of an ecologically diverse soil profile are <br>
central to plant growth and survival as well as ecosystem <br>
development.  The mountaintop removal process to mine coal, which <br>
is widely practiced in the Appalachian coal region, is very <br>
destructive to forest ecosystems.  Success of reclamation efforts <br>
in this region depends on the rate of ecosystem development and <br>
soil productivity of the mine spoil. <br>
<br>
The University of Kentucky is studying mine reclamation for <br>
ecosystem development.  One measure of ecosystem development for <br>
this experiment is the capability of the soil profile to develop <br>
into a material that can hold and transmit water.  Using the <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® system, replicate plots are monitored bi-weekly <br>
to assess vertical distributions of water within the upper 30 cm <br>
of the soil profile. Water storage measured with the <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® system is compared to the computed available <br>
water from the soil-water retention curves.  A mass balance <br>
computed at the soil surface and within the upper 30 cm of the <br>
soil is compared to precipitation, and evapo-transpiration to <br>
computer percolation below the surface horizon.<br>
 <br>
Water content within the rooting zone is important for tree and <br>
microbial population survival.  Water transport characteristics <br>
such as total porosity, drainable porosity, field capacity, <br>
wilting point and infiltration capacity are used to calculate <br>
the available water in the soil profile. <br>

                            Engineers, hydrologists and geologists require detailed moisture <br>
content data to properly evaluate soil stability. <br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® monitoring systems enable these professionals to <br>
analyze soil conditions with a high degree of accuracy, and make <br>
their recommendations with confidence.<br>
 <br>
Current applications of MOISTURE.POINT® in the Civil Engineering <br>
field include: <br>
* Development and design of water resources and irrigation <br>
drainage systems; <br>
* Moisture monitoring under structures; <br>
* Moisture monitoring in earth-filled dams; <br>
* Disaster prediction research related to topographical changes; <br>
* Analysis of sand arrestation and coastline protection/erosion; <br>
* Analysis of changeable water flow affected by melting snow; <br>
* Determination of water penetration and evaporation from soils; <br>
* Moisture monitoring in cement and cement building materials. <br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®&#39;s primary advantages are:<br>
* Installation of the system is simple, inexpensive, and with <br>
minimal site disturbance - no site excavation work is required, <br>
and data obtained represents an accurate reflection of the <br>
surrounding soil.<br>
* The system is extremely durable - even for extended periods of <br>
time under the worst climatic conditions. <br>
* MOISTURE.POINT® data is easily collected on-site or remotely <br>
using conventional acquisition techniques and communications <br>
methods (including cellular).  MOISTURE.POINT® systems include a <br>
standard RS232 port for access to raw data, waveform display and <br>
system settings via personal computer. <br>
<br>
Following is a selection of typical MOISTURE.POINT® applications <br>
in the field of civil engineering.<br>
<br>
Airport Groundwater Monitoring<br>
Gardermoen Airport, Norway <br>
<br>
Norway&#39;s use of MOISTURE.POINT® may be significant first step to <br>
international information transfer on protection of groundwater <br>
resources. <br>
<br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/air-app.htm<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® systems are being used at the new Gardermoen <br>
Airport in Norway as part of a national study designed to <br>
provide a model of pollutant transportation and establish <br>
remedial actions against spreading of pollutants from the <br>
airport to the groundwater. <br>
<br>
Since the airport is situated on top of Norway&#39;s only clean <br>
underground freshwater aquifer, it is critical to understand the <br>
environmental impacts of the new airport on the subsurface.  The <br>
surrounding land has diagonal soil layers comprised of different <br>
materials, with an approximate slope of 15 degrees.  This slope <br>
could result in flow rates that significantly differ from the <br>
water infiltration models they had previously devised.  The <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  multiplexed system was installed to validate <br>
the flow models that have been designed, and to better <br>
understand the impact of potential airport-related groundwater <br>
contaminants. <br>
<br>
The Gardermoen Project is part of an extensive national project <br>
to increase understanding of how contaminants are bound and <br>
degraded in soil and groundwater, and thus to understand and <br>
predict their behaviour and spread.  The study is also looking at <br>
the effects of contaminants on the natural processes in the soil <br>
and at the interaction with global biogeochemical cycles.  The <br>
objective of the program is to further strengthen Norwegian <br>
expertise in contaminant hydrogeology.  This expertise will <br>
enable Norwegians to supply industry and governmental agencies <br>
around the world with knowledge to develop new technologies and <br>
guidelines to protect groundwater resources and remediate <br>
contaminated soil and aquifers. <br>
<br>
<br>
Heavy Vehicle Traffic<br>
Puerto Rico and Vicksburg, Mississippi<br>
<br>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the Waterways Experimental <br>
Station in Vicksburg, Mississippi is developing a soil moisture <br>
chart for heavy vehicle operators.  The chart will indicate how <br>
much precipitation the soil can withstand before vehicles cannot <br>
be driven across the surface and how long after the <br>
precipitation before vehicles can be driven again.  The study <br>
includes monitoring of soil moisture, soil strength, and <br>
precipitation events for a variety of soil types. <br>
<br>
Two MOISTURE.POINT®  instruments and Type K profiling probes (4Ó <br>
x 6Ó) are being used.  Phase I of the project was conducted in <br>
Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has diverse topography, soil types and <br>
micro-climatic regions, all within close geographic proximity, <br>
making it an ideal location for this type of study.  Soil <br>
moisture, weather station and soil strength data were collected <br>
from February until June of 1997.  The MOISTURE.POINT® system <br>
provided excellent results. <br>
<br>
In August 1997, the experiment was moved to Vicksburg, <br>
Mississippi, where the soil moisture, weather station and soil <br>
compaction data from Puerto Rico was also being analyzed. <br>
Throughout the remainder of the summer and fall, the study <br>
looked at the relationship between heavy vehicle traffic and <br>
soil moisture in a variety of sand, silt and silty loam soils <br>
along the banks of the Mississippi River.<br>
<br>
Road Monitoring<br>
Tennessee, U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Researchers in the Agricultural Engineering and Civil <br>
Engineering Departments of an American University are using <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  to monitor substrate water content below <br>
asphaltic concrete pavement.  The objective of the research is to <br>
demonstrate the seasonal variation in water content and <br>
temperature in pavement substrates, and to measure the effects <br>
of these variations on pavement performance.  Three test sites <br>
have been selected for this study, representing the range of <br>
environmental and geotechnical conditions that exist across <br>
Tennessee.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  profiling probes have been placed horizontally <br>
in the soil substrate, stone substrate and asphalt stabilized <br>
base layer beneath the outer wheel path of the roadway.  The <br>
installation was done from a trench constructed in the shoulder <br>
of the road.  These profiling probes will allow monitoring of a <br>
wetting front moving horizontally in the substrate. <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  single segment probes have been placed in the <br>
asphaltic concrete, installed during construction, before the <br>
material cooled. <br>
<br>
At each site, rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind <br>
speed, and solar radiation will be monitored.  Temperature <br>
sensors have been placed in the asphalt concrete through a core <br>
hole.  Non-destructive Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests <br>
will be periodically performed at each site to correlate <br>
pavement performance with environmental conditions.  This will <br>
permit direct observation of the effects of substrate water <br>
content variations on pavement performance.<br>
<br>
A MOISTURE.POINT®  multiplexed datalogging system has been <br>
installed in a metal enclosure inside a concrete vault outside <br>
the roadway shoulder at each site.  The system will collect data <br>
from the probes, substrate and pavement temperature sensors, <br>
rainfall tipping buckets and other climatological sensors.<br>
<br>
Atmospheric Research<br>
Kansas, U.S.A.<br>
<br>
The Argonne Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE) is a new research <br>
initiative devoted to addressing a myriad of unresolved <br>
fundamental questions in atmospheric research.  The initial focus <br>
of ABLE will be measurements of the planetary boundary layer <br>
where most interactions between the atmosphere and humans take <br>
place. Many important scientific issues are being addressed <br>
including natural disaster reduction, public safety, and water <br>
resource management.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  is being used in one study to better understand <br>
the relationship between soil moisture, soil hydraulic processes <br>
and precipitation length scales.  A total of 16 sites will be <br>
monitored using MOISTURE.POINT® five-segment profiling probes <br>
in the Towanda Sub-basin of Kansas.  Spacing between the probes <br>
will be approximately 10m along a transect to obtain a two-<br>
dimensional representation of soil/water dynamics.  The full <br>
installation will be composed of two eight-probe transects <br>
placed in a cross pattern. <br>
<br>
Temperature measurements will be made at three depths in the <br>
proximity of each probe to be used primarily for temperature <br>
corrections.  Remote access to the automated system will be <br>
provided through the use of a cellular telephone modem link to <br>
allow for data retrieval and continuous site monitoring. Rain <br>
gauges will be installed to record date and time of each <br>
precipitation event.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  was selected for this study by researchers from <br>
Oregon State University because two similar systems had already <br>
been successfully deployed in the Boreal Ecosystem and <br>
Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) to monitor soil moisture.<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® was selected to provide the moisture measurement <br>
data for these studies because of its unique features, including <br>
profiling of moisture at different depths with minimal soil <br>
disturbance; easy installation and relocation; and performance <br>
in different soil types. <br>

                            MOISTURE.POINT® offers its users the unique ability to <br>
accurately measure horizontal and vertical soil moisture <br>
profiles - with virtually no disturbance to existing soil <br>
horizons. <br>
<br>
In the fields of agriculture, silviculture and irrigation, <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® has numerous possible applications, including: <br>
* Determining correlations between soil moisture and other <br>
environmental variables on plant growth; <br>
* Accurately differentiating the moisture requirements between <br>
plant species; <br>
* Determining irrigation routines that provide an optimal root <br>
environment for balanced plant growth; <br>
* Determining irrigation routines that maximize water <br>
conservation.<br>
*  Analyzing the distribution effectiveness of irrigation <br>
systems; <br>
<br>
Below is a selection of typical Moisture·Point® applications in <br>
agriculture, silviculture, and irrigation. <br>
<br>
1. Agriculture<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® systems make it possible to conduct innovative <br>
and valuable agricultural research around the world.<br>
 <br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/agri-app.htm<br>
<br>
In each of the following applications, MOISTURE.POINT® offers <br>
researchers the unique ability to monitor a vertical soil <br>
moisture profile.  This can be accomplished with virtually no <br>
disturbance to existing soil horizons and, with an unparalleled <br>
degree of resolution in TDR-based data collection. <br>
<br>
Microspray Irrigation Management Study<br>
USDA-ARS, California <br>
<br>
Researchers are studying the effects of a microspray irrigation <br>
system on soil moisture distribution near large walnut tree root <br>
systems, versus in open areas.  The correlation between soil <br>
moisture levels, soil pests and their control is also being <br>
studied. The trial is being replicated over five years in order <br>
to evaluate the long term impacts and the success of this <br>
irrigation management technique. <br>
The flexibility and ease of installation of the MOISTURE.POINT® <br>
system has allowed researchers to obtain moisture level <br>
information in and around large root systems, providing accurate <br>
data collection in confined areas. <br>
<br>
Study of Impact of Greenhouse Effect on Water Availability<br>
Department of Geography, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland<br>
 <br>
Researchers in Switzerland are currently studying the impact of <br>
the greenhouse effect on water availability for plants. <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®  systems are being used to measure soil moisture <br>
data for this study.  Fifty one-square-metre cells with one-third <br>
of metre Plexiglas walls and a lid have been positioned on a <br>
steep slope with a southern exposure.  Inside each cell, the <br>
atmosphere is artificially augmented with C02 delivered through <br>
a perforated conduit system.  This artificial atmosphere is <br>
designed to emulate the atmosphere a few decades from now, based <br>
on the current C02 rate of increase.<br>
 <br>
The cells are equipped with C02, 02 and temperature sensors.  A <br>
circular antenna laid on the soil in each cell emits a frequency <br>
that brings earthworms to the surface.  Counting the worms in <br>
each cell permits an assessment of the biological activity of <br>
the soil. <br>
<br>
Until recently, the study did not include accurate soil moisture <br>
data as the researchers had been unable to find probes suitable <br>
to this application.  To be effective, the probes had to be <br>
installed in the soil to a depth of one metre without causing <br>
major disruption to the soil structure.  Also, the probes had to <br>
be installed with little available surface area given the <br>
existing suite of sensors.  MOISTURE.POINT® was selected for its <br>
unique ability to meet these requirements. <br>
<br>
Assessment of Water Retention of Farm Fields under Varying <br>
Tillage Techniques<br>
Charlottetown Research Centre (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada)<br>
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island <br>
<br>
At this facility, researchers are using MOISTURE.POINT® to <br>
assess the water retention characteristics of farm fields under <br>
varying tillage techniques, with a focus on conservation <br>
tillage.  This technique allows the residual mulch from potato <br>
plants to remain in the top soil layer, which is believed to <br>
reduce evapo-transpirative loss.  At the same time, it is <br>
theorized that conservation tillage facilitates rapid water <br>
infiltration during irrigation or precipitation events.<br>
<br>
2. Silviculture<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® makes it possible to increase growth and yield, <br>
while saving on water, power and fertilizer.<br>
<br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/silv-app.htm<br>
<br>
Tree nurseries are increasingly using new techniques, such as <br>
large potted seedlings and air-slit containers, in their effort <br>
to cultivate strong, healthy plants with well-developed root <br>
structures.  Although it has been proven that irrigation <br>
techniques play a critical role in seedling physiology, <br>
traditional approaches to determining seasonal soil water <br>
requirements during the growth period have been typically <br>
qualitative.  There has not been a quick, accurate means of <br>
measuring the water content in the potting medium (comprised of <br>
peat, vermiculite and sand)...until the development of <br>
MOISTURE.POINT®.  This is the first system to provide routine, <br>
precise volumetric moisture monitoring capability in a broad <br>
range of soils, including peat and other porous media used in <br>
greenhouse cultivation.<br>
 <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® provides the empirical data necessary for <br>
greenhouse specialists to establish effective irrigation <br>
routines that optimize growth and yield in their nursery. <br>
Greenhouse specialists can monitor water content of their soils <br>
in &quot;real-time&quot;, and irrigation can easily designed to <br>
accommodate seasonal conditions, tree species and planting media <br>
variations.<br>
 <br>
Measuring Moisture Content in Peat Substrates <br>
Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources, Canada <br>
<br>
A recent study was undertaken by the Quebec Ministry of Natural <br>
Resources in which water content was measured three times per <br>
week, using 24 probes in peat substrates within the tree <br>
production greenhouses.  The MOISTURE.POINT® system was used to <br>
determine moisture levels in several small containers by <br>
arranging one long single-diode probe to pass through several of <br>
the containers. Moisture·Point® provided reliable measurement of <br>
water content in peat and vermiculite potting mixes with an <br>
average accuracy of better than 3%, reproducible from week to <br>
week.  As well, ministry greenhouse staff were able to maintain <br>
preset moisture levels.<br>
<br>
3. Irrigation <br>
<br>
Successful use of MOISTURE.POINT® in raspberry farming allows <br>
for accurate scheduling of irrigation and saves 10 percent in <br>
watering costs for the season.<br>
<br>
http://www.esica.com/products/moisture/apps/irig-app.htm<br>
<br>
MOISTURE.POINT® systems were installed in established raspberry <br>
fields near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  The region has <br>
an annual moisture deficit of approximately 432-mm per growing <br>
season and raspberries must be irrigated to achieve optimum <br>
production.<br>
 <br>
The farm currently has two types of irrigation systems - a hand-<br>
moved sprinkler system in one field and a trickle system in a <br>
second field.  Moisture monitoring equipment was used in both <br>
fields to determine the effectiveness of the irrigation to <br>
develop new watering schedules to save water. <br>
<br>
One probe was installed in the sprinkler-irrigated field in the <br>
row line of the raspberry plants.  In the trickle irrigated <br>
field, two probes were installed, one in the row midway between <br>
two point-source emitters and the other probe between the <br>
raspberry rows, approximately 1.5 metres from the emitters. <br>
The moisture data were recorded along with the time of day and <br>
weather conditions.  Initially, readings were taken at three-to <br>
four-day intervals and then at closer intervals near sprinkler <br>
irrigation times. <br>
<br>
The sprinkler irrigation system was initially operated on a <br>
timed schedule that was independent of soil moisture levels. <br>
After the first two cycles of operation, the maximum soil <br>
moisture levels for different depths were determined.  Similarly, <br>
minimum moisture levels to sustain food crop production were <br>
established.  This enabled sprinkler irrigation scheduling to be <br>
planned based on safe moisture levels, rather than on time.  The <br>
user claims that the instrument not only saved water due to more <br>
accurate scheduling knowledge, but it also saved 10% of the cost <br>
of the irrigation water for the season.<br>

                            GRO.POINT is a rugged, easy to use, and maintenance-free <br>
instrument for soil moisture management.  It provides immediate <br>
and accurate responses to changes in soil moisture in the root <br>
zone, and is designed to remain in the soil for the duration of <br>
a crop, or even on a permanent basis.  GRO.POINT can operate on a <br>
stand-alone basis, or is easily integrated into an ESI or other <br>
automated irrigation control system. <br>
<br>
Designed and developed by ESI, GRO.POINT is a cost-effective <br>
soil moisture-sensing instrument that provides accurate <br>
measurement of soil moisture by volume.  GRO.POINT uses a <br>
refined TDT technology that was specifically developed to <br>
provide growers with the management information that is required <br>
to enable them to: <br>
* obtain higher yields<br>
* grow better quality crops<br>
* optimize water use<br>
* reduce excessive leaching. <br>
<br>
Manufactured in stainless steel with all interfaces sealed in <br>
epoxy, the GRO.POINT soil moisture instrument will provide <br>
years of reliable service.  There are currently two models <br>
available: the GRO.POINT Standard Sensor and the Extended Range <br>
Sensor. <br>

                            MOISTURE.POINT® offers powerful decision support for alternative <br>
landfill cover validation<br>
<br>
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <br>
maintains stringent regulations regarding the final cover of a <br>
closed landfill.  The intent of their &quot;Subtitle D&quot; prescriptive <br>
final closure is to create a cover which will eliminate water <br>
infiltration and minimize erosion. <br>
<br>
The EPA&#39;s prescribed cover includes a 6 inch &quot;erosion layer&quot;, <br>
designed to support native vegetation, directly above an 18 inch <br>
low-permeability &quot;infiltration layer&quot;, commonly composed of clay <br>
or bentonite.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Solid Waste Landfill Closures <br>
<br>
In many parts of the United States, clay or bentonite is not <br>
locally available. To meet the EPA&#39;s prescribed landfill cover <br>
definition in these regions, these infiltration layer materials <br>
must be acquired and transported from other regions, at great <br>
cost.  An additional problem with both clay and bentonite is that <br>
they are liable to crack and desiccate in arid regions, thus <br>
undermining the integrity of the cap. <br>
<br>
Alternative / Monolithic Cover Designs <br>
<br>
Motivated by the above financial and operational incentives, <br>
many cities, municipalities and landfill operators are looking <br>
to close their solid waste landfills with an alternative final <br>
cover.  The monolithic approach, a final cover design comprised <br>
of compacted locally available, low-permeability soil, is <br>
quickly gaining acceptance at all levels, including government <br>
regulators, environmental engineering firms and end users.  The <br>
net benefits are (1) significant cost advantages over the <br>
prescribed cover design, and (2) reduced operational concerns in <br>
terms of cover implementation and maintenance. <br>
<br>
Implementation of an alternative landfill cover design requires <br>
approval by government regulators.  A prerequisite of the <br>
approval process is validation of the integrity of the cover; <br>
i.e.: Is it working? If a moisture monitoring system is required <br>
to validate the performance of the alternative final cover, <br>
E.S.I. Environmental Sensors Inc.&#39;s MOISTURE.POINT® provides the <br>
solution. <br>
<br>
Landfill Monitoring<br>
Arizona, U.S.A.<br>
<br>
Regulations have been developed in the United States to define a <br>
cover design for landfill closures that provides an impervious <br>
barrier to surface moisture infiltration and thus prevents <br>
contamination of the groundwater.  The regulations recognize that <br>
regional variations may not suit the prescribed cover design, <br>
and an allowance for alternative designs is included. <br>
<br>
Alternative designs must pass a rigorous approval process. <br>
Covers usually include the construction of a clay layer, which <br>
is prone to desiccation and cracking in arid climates.  When this <br>
happens, the clay layer allows water to penetrate through it. <br>
Alternative cover designs must maintain an unsaturated profile <br>
inhibiting breakthrough and, where appropriate, enhancing evapo-<br>
transpiration with native plant species. <br>
<br>
A MOISTURE.POINT® Landfill Monitoring System incorporates ESI&#39;s <br>
patented multi-segment profiling probes together with a full <br>
suite of meteorological sensors to provide a complete monitoring <br>
system for alternative landfill cover validation.  The probes are <br>
installed vertically from the surface with minimal soil <br>
disturbance.  Additional system options include solar power and <br>
cellular modem for remote, unattended operation and data <br>
communications.  The system is easy to use and provides reliable <br>
moisture data in contiguous profiles with minimal site impact.  <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® has little calibration sensitivity to variations <br>
in soil structure, and provides a predictable response to <br>
variations in soil conductivity, soil structure and <br>
permeability.  In addition, MOISTURE.POINT® allows for post-<br>
construction sensor installation without disturbing the soil <br>
profile. <br>
<br>
In a recent application in the State of Arizona, an alternative <br>
test cover study has been implemented with a goal of <br>
demonstrating that an effective alternative cover can be <br>
constructed using locally available silty sand soils. <br>
MOISTURE.POINT® was selected to provide the data necessary to <br>
validate the effectiveness of the alternative cover design.<br>
<br>
The focus of the study is on two one-acre test covers <br>
constructed at the landfill.  Each test cover has a dedicated, <br>
multiplexed soil moisture monitoring system, housed in a <br>
weatherproof enclosure, located in a central location on the <br>
test cover.  Each test cover contains 29 soil moisture-sensing <br>
probes, each providing readings at five different depths. <br>
<br>
The data allows regulators from the Arizona Department of <br>
Environmental Quality to assess whether or not the test covers <br>
meet the requirement of the regulations.<br>
