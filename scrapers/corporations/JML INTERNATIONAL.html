                            I.E.E. Soil Stabilizer is presently in use in twenty three countries around the world both for road building and dust control in the mining industry. IEE lets you build more roads, more economically while attaining higher load bearing specifications, reduced permeability and reduced maintenance costs; often and most importantly, with far less imported materials!<br>

                            Eco-Enzyme is a fermented, liquid multi-enzyme produced in the United States. It has been approved for specific uses by the USDA. This includes its use as a general cleaner at federally inspected meat and poultry processing plants. <br>
<br>
Since 1996 it has been tested and developed at our Costa Rican facility for a broad range of environmentally sensitive applications. These include sanitation, the elimination of malodor, flies, mosquitoes and their larvae as well as for the acceleration of all types of organic biodegradation. Despite our well documented effectiveness, Eco-Enzyme is non-chemical, not an insecticide nor a detergent. <br>
<br>
Eco-Enzyme is a 21st century enzyme technology that is effective and economical. It is a safe, organic product composed entirely of food grade vegetable ingredients. There are no bacteria present in any of our products and they are factory certified free of salmonella.<br>
<br>
Our product works in part due to the catalytic action of its proprietary enzyme cocktail. Eco-Enzyme functions best in aerobic situations (presence of Oxygen) though we have also demonstrated powerful odor elimination results in anaerobic systems (ask to see our Perdue University manure pit study). Eco-Enzyme eliminates odor by chemically altering ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and phenols. We are most effective in lowering the all important O.D.T. (Odor Detection Threshold), the most telling measure of odor as a nuisance.<br>
<br>
Eco-Enzyme is organic and 100% biodegradable. Eco-Enzyme accelerates biodegradation in organic composting applications and significantly improves wastewater characteristics in many wastewater treatment applications.<br>
<br>
It is non toxic and harmless to humans, marine life, flora and fauna. The conscientious application of Eco-Enzyme in chicken and pig farms has been demonstrated to improve animal health, increase productivity ratios and reduce the incidence of respiratory illness. <br>
Eco-Enzyme works well within a wide range of pH and temperatures. It is non-hazardous, not explosive nor combustible. It causes no known allergic reactions and no special handling precautions are required for personnel applying our products<br>

Risk Analysis<br>
<br>
JML<br>
Provides a unique service that complements the work of financial <br>
and technical engineers. We place their findings and <br>
recommendations of prospective investors and investment bankers <br>
in an unbiased context that takes into account political, <br>
regulatory and economic issues as well as the market history and <br>
outlook.<br>
<br>
Considerations:<br>
Factors other than price, such as the attractiveness of business <br>
plans, will weigh significantly in the registration and bidding <br>
process and affect their outcome. Investor strategies need to be <br>
based on a foundation that includes an understanding of social <br>
and political, regulatory and economic institutions in Latin <br>
America as much as it does on knowledge of technical issues. By <br>
helping clients in these two areas we strengthen competitiveness.<br>
<br>
Due Diligence:<br>
JML amplifies the quantitative and qualitative analysis carried <br>
out in the process of due-diligence by the prospective investor. <br>
An area of concern is the matter of ecological liabilities that <br>
a <br>
buyer might be required to assume and that might come to be an <br>
important operating difficulty and expenditure. We will assist <br>
the buyer in developing protection mechanisms to be included in <br>
the purchase agreements.<br>
<br>
Intelligence:<br>
Our fundamental purpose is to support management in the <br>
assessment of risk and opportunity. We are committed to <br>
providing <br>
clients with a solid basis of intelligence for an investment <br>
decision: the judgment may be to enter this initial round of <br>
bidding or to postpone bidding until a future phase of <br>
restructuring takes place.<br>
<br>
Scenario Analysis:<br>
JML has ample experience in Latin America. We have know-how and <br>
know-who in the public and private sectors, which provide the <br>
elements for creating perceptive scenarios. This is how we <br>
assist <br>
prospective buyers/investors and their other advisors to better <br>
comprehend the environment in which they would register, bid <br>
and, <br>
if successful, operate these units.<br>
<br>
That&#39;s why our work goes beyond the statistical and qualitative <br>
analysis of data. For example, we arrange meetings with key <br>
individuals in government and private sector so that our clients <br>
come to have more suitable intuitive feeling for the Mexican <br>
mind <br>
set.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, we add value with our appraisal of the operating <br>
environment and the market. We assess and analyse from singular <br>
vantage point the seller&#39;s disclosures and financial and <br>
technical evaluations. In this way we help shape successful <br>
qualifying and bidding strategies.<br>
<br>
JML SUPPLIES DIRECTION, INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL SUPPORT.<br>
<br>
1. We help the prospective Buyer/Investor to meet the initial <br>
challenge of qualifying as a bidder in the registration process.<br>
<br>
2. We provide a technical and quantitative analysis of Seller&#39;s <br>
Data and Disclosures.<br>
<br>

<br>
4. We carry out a Review of the Technical Assessments prepared <br>
by <br>
investors and their engineering and financial advisors.<br>
<br>
JML relies on specialized data resources and analytical <br>
abilities, corporate experience in the Mexican operating <br>
environment and a network of key people.<br>
<br>
Corporate Experience<br>
Our associates draw on many years of corporate and consulting <br>
experience derived from analysis performed through a <br>
multidisciplinary approach.<br>
<br>
Networking Strengths<br>
Through the years we have met and dealt with those who mater in <br>
Government and the Private Sector. This know-who allows us to <br>
reveal facts that are not explicitly stated in the disclosures <br>
or <br>
standard exercises of profitability or sensitivity analysis.<br>
<br>
Data Resources<br>
We have an in-house database on the Mexican import-export <br>
activities, which allows us to compare historical data with <br>
figures and interpretations provided in the disclosures.<br>
<br>
Analytical Abilities<br>
In the course of our work with the public and private sectors, <br>
we <br>
have developed our own methodologies and in-house research <br>
capabilities to describe patterns and trends in the Mexican <br>
economy as a whole and other specific industries.<br>

                            Eco-Enzyme is a fermented, liquid multi-enzyme produced in the United States. It has been approved for specific uses by the USDA. This includes its use as a general cleaner at federally inspected meat and poultry processing plants. <br>
<br>
Since 1996 it has been tested and developed at our Costa Rican facility for a broad range of environmentally sensitive applications. These include sanitation, the elimination of malodor, flies, mosquitoes and their larvae as well as for the acceleration of all types of organic biodegradation. Despite our well documented effectiveness, Eco-Enzyme is non-chemical, not an insecticide nor a detergent. <br>
<br>
Eco-Enzyme is a 21st century enzyme technology that is effective and economical. It is a safe, organic product composed entirely of food grade vegetable ingredients. There are no bacteria present in any of our products and they are factory certified free of salmonella.<br>
<br>
Our product works in part due to the catalytic action of its proprietary enzyme cocktail. Eco-Enzyme functions best in aerobic situations (presence of Oxygen) though we have also demonstrated powerful odor elimination results in anaerobic systems (ask to see our Perdue University manure pit study). Eco-Enzyme eliminates odor by chemically altering ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and phenols. We are most effective in lowering the all important O.D.T. (Odor Detection Threshold), the most telling measure of odor as a nuisance.<br>
<br>
Eco-Enzyme is organic and 100% biodegradable. Eco-Enzyme accelerates biodegradation in organic composting applications and significantly improves wastewater characteristics in many wastewater treatment applications.<br>
<br>
It is non toxic and harmless to humans, marine life, flora and fauna. The conscientious application of Eco-Enzyme in chicken and pig farms has been demonstrated to improve animal health, increase productivity ratios and reduce the incidence of respiratory illness. <br>
Eco-Enzyme works well within a wide range of pH and temperatures. It is non-hazardous, not explosive nor combustible. It causes no known allergic reactions and no special handling precautions are required for personnel applying our products<br>

<br>
JML<br>
Provides a unique service that complements the work of financial <br>
and technical engineers. We place their findings and <br>
recommendations of prospective investors and investment bankers <br>
in an unbiased context that takes into account political, <br>
regulatory and economic issues as well as the market history and <br>
outlook.<br>
<br>
Considerations:<br>
Factors other than price, such as the attractiveness of business <br>
plans, will weigh significantly in the registration and bidding <br>
process and affect their outcome. Investor strategies need to be <br>
based on a foundation that includes an understanding of social <br>
and political, regulatory and economic institutions in Latin <br>
America as much as it does on knowledge of technical issues. By <br>
helping clients in these two areas we strengthen competitiveness.<br>
<br>
Due Diligence:<br>
JML amplifies the quantitative and qualitative analysis carried <br>
out in the process of due-diligence by the prospective investor. <br>
An area of concern is the matter of ecological liabilities that <br>
a <br>
buyer might be required to assume and that might come to be an <br>
important operating difficulty and expenditure. We will assist <br>
the buyer in developing protection mechanisms to be included in <br>
the purchase agreements.<br>
<br>
Intelligence:<br>
Our fundamental purpose is to support management in the <br>
assessment of risk and opportunity. We are committed to <br>
providing <br>
clients with a solid basis of intelligence for an investment <br>
decision: the judgment may be to enter this initial round of <br>
bidding or to postpone bidding until a future phase of <br>
restructuring takes place.<br>
<br>
Scenario Analysis:<br>
JML has ample experience in Latin America. We have know-how and <br>
know-who in the public and private sectors, which provide the <br>
elements for creating perceptive scenarios. This is how we <br>
assist <br>
prospective buyers/investors and their other advisors to better <br>
comprehend the environment in which they would register, bid <br>
and, <br>
if successful, operate these units.<br>
<br>
That&#39;s why our work goes beyond the statistical and qualitative <br>
analysis of data. For example, we arrange meetings with key <br>
individuals in government and private sector so that our clients <br>
come to have more suitable intuitive feeling for the Mexican <br>
mind <br>
set.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, we add value with our appraisal of the operating <br>
environment and the market. We assess and analyse from singular <br>
vantage point the seller&#39;s disclosures and financial and <br>
technical evaluations. In this way we help shape successful <br>
qualifying and bidding strategies.<br>
<br>
JML SUPPLIES DIRECTION, INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL SUPPORT.<br>

<br>
JML relies on specialized data resources and analytical <br>
abilities, corporate experience in the Mexican operating <br>
environment and a network of key people.<br>
<br>
Corporate Experience<br>
Our associates draw on many years of corporate and consulting <br>
experience derived from analysis performed through a <br>
multidisciplinary approach.<br>
<br>
Networking Strengths<br>
Through the years we have met and dealt with those who mater in <br>
Government and the Private Sector. This know-who allows us to <br>
reveal facts that are not explicitly stated in the disclosures <br>
or <br>
standard exercises of profitability or sensitivity analysis.<br>
<br>
Data Resources<br>
We have an in-house database on the Mexican import-export <br>
activities, which allows us to compare historical data with <br>
figures and interpretations provided in the disclosures.<br>
<br>
Analytical Abilities<br>
