                            Comissioning is a quality-asssurance process that ensures the performance of a building’s systems and assemblies, as well as their conformity with the intentions of the designer and with the owner’s requirements. The main advantage of such a process is that it allows to control the early achievement of expected performance from the beginning to the end of the project, regarless of its nature (construction, renovation, redevelopment, expansion, etc.).<br>
<br>

                            Recommissioning consists in improving the operation modes of buildings or systems according to the current needs and condition of the building, without involving major investments for the replacement of main electromechanical equipment. According to Natural Resources Canada, recommissioning typically leads to a reduction of the overall energy consumption of a building by 5 to 15 %, not to mention that this process improves the value and lifecycle of the building, as well as the comfort of its occupants. <br>
<br>
Ambioner was one of the first companies in Quebec to offer its building recommissioning(Rcx) services, independently from turnkey energy-efficiency projects. We have earned a strong reputation in the market, by helping customers like McGill University , the University of Quebec and the Grand Théâtre de Québec to achieve energy savings and major operation improvements, while increasing the service life of their equipement.<br>

                            Energy audits are an excellent way to acquire a better knowledge of a building’s energy consumption. Ambioner’s experts first visit the installations and collect information on the operating modes, then analyze these data. They will then submit a detailed energy audit report with the conclusions of their analysis. A typical energy audit report contains the following information: <br>
•	Description of electromechanical installations;<br>
•	Assessment and analysis of the actual energy consumption (kW,kWh,GJ, GHGs);<br>
•	Analysis of the variations in energy consumption observed during the year;<br>
•	Distribution of the energy consumption by energy-consuming systems;<br>
•	Comparison of the building’s consumption with that of similar buildings;and<br>
•	Suggestions of energy-efficiency measures tailored to customer needs.<br>
With an energy audit report in hand, we will be able to elaborate an energy-savings project solution or to produce an energy master plan that will help you make informed choices to reduce your energy costs efficiently.<br>

                            Once an energy audit report is completed, if customer wishes to implement energy-efficiency measures, each improvement opportunity will be carefully studied, in order to determine if they are feasible. Ambioner’s experts will evaluate the costs incurred and savings expectable, as well as the environmental impact (indoor and outdoor environment) and service life of each energy-savings measure, in order to choose the most profitable. We can then carry out the design of the selected measures and and supervise thir implementation. <br>
Our professionals will also help you identify the type of investments most suitable for your building in order to maximize the cost efficiency of your infrastructures on a long-term basis. Here are a few examples of questions we can help you answer: <br>
Should we undertake a qualification process for a turnkey energy efficiency project with an energy savings company, or rather work with a engineering consulting firm on a project under the  traditional approach? <br>
Our boilers are obsolete. Should we simply remplace them, explore new technologies, update our whole heating network… How can we get the right information?<br>
Could we use a part of our budget dedicated to infrastructures to integrate new technologies?<br>

                            The objective of value analysis sessions is to increase the value of a project by sharing the optimization opportunities in each discipline involved (architecture, mechanical, electrical, civil and structure engineering, etc.), while making sure all the project’s needs are respected. Value analysis allows for a significant reduction in both implementation and operational costs of a project. Ambioner will support you by leading the value analysis workshops, in order to ensure that the project is optimized and progresses efficiently. <br>

                            Comissioning is a quality-asssurance process that ensures the performance of a building’s systems and assemblies, as well as their conformity with the intentions of the designer and with the owner’s requirements. The main advantage of such a process is that it allows to control the early achievement of expected performance from the beginning to the end of the project, regarless of its nature (construction, renovation, redevelopment, expansion, etc.).<br>
<br>
Ambioner is a pioneer of commissioning in Quebec. We have accomplished several large-scale projects in the institutional and commercial sectors, with clients such the Société Québécois des Infrastuctures ans Public Works and Government Service Canada. We leverage our strenght in our numerous expert resources, among which we count engineers which are certified CPMP (Commissioning Process Management Professional) by the AHSRAE, as well as expert technicians in building control and optimization.<br>

                            Recommissioning consists in improving the operation modes of buildings or systems according to the current needs and condition of the building, without involving major investments for the replacement of main electromechanical equipment. According to Natural Resources Canada, recommissioning typically leads to a reduction of the overall energy consumption of a building by 5 to 15 %, not to mention that this process improves the value and lifecycle of the building, as well as the comfort of its occupants. <br>
<br>
Ambioner was one of the first companies in Quebec to offer its building recommissioning(Rcx) services, independently from turnkey energy-efficiency projects. We have earned a strong reputation in the market, by helping customers like McGill University , the University of Quebec and the Grand Théâtre de Québec to achieve energy savings and major operation improvements, while increasing the service life of their equipement.<br>

                            Energy audits are an excellent way to acquire a better knowledge of a building’s energy consumption. Ambioner’s experts first visit the installations and collect information on the operating modes, then analyze these data. They will then submit a detailed energy audit report with the conclusions of their analysis. A typical energy audit report contains the following information: <br>
•	Description of electromechanical installations;<br>
•	Assessment and analysis of the actual energy consumption (kW,kWh,GJ, GHGs);<br>
•	Analysis of the variations in energy consumption observed during the year;<br>
•	Distribution of the energy consumption by energy-consuming systems;<br>
•	Comparison of the building’s consumption with that of similar buildings;and<br>
•	Suggestions of energy-efficiency measures tailored to customer needs.<br>
With an energy audit report in hand, we will be able to elaborate an energy-savings project solution or to produce an energy master plan that will help you make informed choices to reduce your energy costs efficiently.<br>

                            Once an energy audit report is completed, if customer wishes to implement energy-efficiency measures, each improvement opportunity will be carefully studied, in order to determine if they are feasible. Ambioner’s experts will evaluate the costs incurred and savings expectable, as well as the environmental impact (indoor and outdoor environment) and service life of each energy-savings measure, in order to choose the most profitable. We can then carry out the design of the selected measures and and supervise thir implementation. <br>
Our professionals will also help you identify the type of investments most suitable for your building in order to maximize the cost efficiency of your infrastructures on a long-term basis. Here are a few examples of questions we can help you answer: <br>
Should we undertake a qualification process for a turnkey energy efficiency project with an energy savings company, or rather work with a engineering consulting firm on a project under the  traditional approach? <br>
Our boilers are obsolete. Should we simply remplace them, explore new technologies, update our whole heating network… How can we get the right information?<br>
Could we use a part of our budget dedicated to infrastructures to integrate new technologies?<br>

                            Granting bodies invest to encourage durable construction and renovation projects across Canada in a perspective of sustainable development and energy savings. By carrying out preliminary studies and design phases of projects across Canada, we have developed a strong experience taking over grant research and application processes for our customers to obtain the maximum incentives applicable. We are official partners for all the incentive programs with Hydro-Québec, and we know very well the application processes with the main granting bodies. <br>

                            The objective of value analysis sessions is to increase the value of a project by sharing the optimization opportunities in each discipline involved (architecture, mechanical, electrical, civil and structure engineering, etc.), while making sure all the project’s needs are respected. Value analysis allows for a significant reduction in both implementation and operational costs of a project. Ambioner will support you by leading the value analysis workshops, in order to ensure that the project is optimized and progresses efficiently. <br>
