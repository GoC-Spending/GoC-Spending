I have been a client of Atlantic Webfitters since 2009. A web &quot;newbie&quot; I didn&#39;t know the difference between a portal and a website. Gifford was patient and kind. I looked forward to his weekly User Group where fellow DotNetNuker&#39;s of every skill set met to learn and share ideas in an environment where there was no such thing as a stupid question. To all you newbies out there who think you can&#39;t do it - you CAN. Gifford makes it seem easy. And really... it is!<br>

I have had the pleasure of Dealing directly with the President of AtlanticWebFitters (AWF), Gifford Watkins. This review is more about the people than the product. I&#39;m left handed and have been told that I think outside of the box. That being said, Gifford must have two left hands. Have you ever discussed issues with someone whose eyes light up and voice raises with enthusiasm when you ask a question? That&#39;s Gifford. I was told he really knew his stuff, but when I watched him in action, I just sat there with a grin on my face. AWF are not salespeople, they are true techs that are more excited about the project than most clients, and take great pride in customer satisfaction. For anyone that is tired of static web sites and wants their finger on the pulse of their most valuable marketing tool, then I strongly suggested making the move to DotNetNuke. Even more so, I suggest dealing with AWF as they project great patience and understanding throughout and beyond the growth process. Thanks <br>

Testimonial:<br>
&quot;After years of trying to get a Website set up and running as I would like it, with all the features I needed, the cost was prohibitive. I then decided to experiment on my own and develop the website, although not a programmer.  This led to much wasted time and I was not satisfied with the results.  A few years back I was introduced to DotNetNuke through the DNN user group in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  I immediately saw the potential.  With its fully appointed Portal Development and price structure, Gif Watkins at Atlantic Web Fitters very clearly explained how the system functions and was always very professional . Within days I had a web portal developed at a fraction of the cost I would have had to pay elsewhere.  One of the main benefits and functions of the portal is the fact that I can easily update my portal at anytime and anywhere, even at the airport.&quot; <br>

Testimonial:<br>
Gifford is one of the most unusual people I&#39;ve met in technology -- in a good way. Here is a guy who grew up a Nova Scotia lobsterman (he&#39;s shared lobster recipes with me) and was educated as a minister...and without shedding either of those identities built a serious tech company about as far geographically from Silicon Valley as you can get. He&#39;s won the attention of Microsoft and the U.S. Military. And he&#39;s always been willing to share his expertise with me. All in all, Giff is a great story. June 10, 2011  ~Kevin Maney, Columnist, Tech Columnist, Tech Writer, Cover Stories Editor, USA TODAY

              Gifford is one of the most unusual people I&#39;ve met in technology -- in a good way. Here is a guy who grew up a Nova Scotia lobsterman (he&#39;s shared lobster recipes with me) and was educated as a minister...and without shedding either of those identities built a serious tech company about as far geographically from Silicon Valley as you can get. He&#39;s won the attention of Microsoft and the U.S. Military. And he&#39;s always been willing to share his expertise with me. All in all, Giff is a great story. June 10, 2011<br>
<br>
~Kevin Maney, Columnist, Tech Columnist, Tech Writer, Cover Stories Editor, USA TODAY<br>
<br>
I take great pleasure in recommending Gifford Watkins and Atlantic Webfitters. I came across the company through Google and after speaking to him was immediately convinced they were the best partners to help build a client portal. Gifford is a pleasure to work with; his patience and willingness to help bring my vision for a portal to life are greatly appreciated. DNN is brilliant and with the right partner like Atlantic Webfitters it becomes an exceptional piece of Kit. January 7, 2010<br>

Gifford&#39;s Atlantic Webfitters&#39; clients save many thousands of dollars by avoiding the purchase, maintenance, continual replacement and operational support of servers. And they gain access to top of the line software such as SQL database technology, intranet modules for office productivity and content management software, all for a small monthly fee. Additionally, Atlantic Webfitters customers have drastically reduced the need for programmers to make changes to their portals, saving many more thousands of dollars each year. The functionality offered by Atlantic Webfitters&#39; suite of module choices, the ease with which they can be implemented and the low cost make the AWF&#39;s portal solution very attractive. November 20, 2009<br>

Gifford called me over 5 years ago to talk about web consulting. He was very inquisitive and was eager to learn everything he could. He started playing around with some technology, did his research and found the perfect technology for his needs, DotNetNuke. Since starting his company, we have kept in touch and worked on many projects together. You will not find a more dedicated, passionate and skilled person in this industry. I have recommended Gifford many times to some of our clients that are looking for a nice, tight, hosted solution for their portal. Not only does he know his stuff, he is simply a great guy to go have a beer (and Lobster) with. His colourful background, story telling and passion for life makes me proud to call him a friend and colleague. November 20, 2009<br>

I have been a client of Atlantic Webfitters since 2009. A web &quot;newbie&quot; I didn&#39;t know the difference between a portal and a website. Gifford was patient and kind. I looked forward to his weekly User Group where fellow DotNetNuker&#39;s of every skill set met to learn and share ideas in an environment where there was no such thing as a stupid question. To all you newbies out there who think you can&#39;t do it - you CAN. Gifford makes it seem easy. And really... it is!<br>

I have had the pleasure of Dealing directly with the President of AtlanticWebFitters (AWF), Gifford Watkins. This review is more about the people than the product. I&#39;m left handed and have been told that I think outside of the box. That being said, Gifford must have two left hands. Have you ever discussed issues with someone whose eyes light up and voice raises with enthusiasm when you ask a question? That&#39;s Gifford. I was told he really knew his stuff, but when I watched him in action, I just sat there with a grin on my face. AWF are not salespeople, they are true techs that are more excited about the project than most clients, and take great pride in customer satisfaction. For anyone that is tired of static web sites and wants their finger on the pulse of their most valuable marketing tool, then I strongly suggested making the move to DotNetNuke. Even more so, I suggest dealing with AWF as they project great patience and understanding throughout and beyond the growth process. Thanks <br>

Testimonial:<br>
&quot;After years of trying to get a Website set up and running as I would like it, with all the features I needed, the cost was prohibitive. I then decided to experiment on my own and develop the website, although not a programmer.  This led to much wasted time and I was not satisfied with the results.  A few years back I was introduced to DotNetNuke through the DNN user group in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  I immediately saw the potential.  With its fully appointed Portal Development and price structure, Gif Watkins at Atlantic Web Fitters very clearly explained how the system functions and was always very professional . Within days I had a web portal developed at a fraction of the cost I would have had to pay elsewhere.  One of the main benefits and functions of the portal is the fact that I can easily update my portal at anytime and anywhere, even at the airport.&quot; <br>

Gifford is one of the most unusual people I&#39;ve met in technology -- in a good way. Here is a guy who grew up a Nova Scotia lobsterman (he&#39;s shared lobster recipes with me) and was educated as a minister...and without shedding either of those identities built a serious tech company about as far geographically from Silicon Valley as you can get. He&#39;s won the attention of Microsoft and the U.S. Military. And he&#39;s always been willing to share his expertise with me. All in all, Giff is a great story. June 10, 2011  ~Kevin Maney, Columnist, Tech Columnist, Tech Writer, Cover Stories Editor, USA TODAY

              Gifford is one of the most unusual people I&#39;ve met in technology -- in a good way. Here is a guy who grew up a Nova Scotia lobsterman (he&#39;s shared lobster recipes with me) and was educated as a minister...and without shedding either of those identities built a serious tech company about as far geographically from Silicon Valley as you can get. He&#39;s won the attention of Microsoft and the U.S. Military. And he&#39;s always been willing to share his expertise with me. All in all, Giff is a great story. June 10, 2011<br>

I take great pleasure in recommending Gifford Watkins and Atlantic Webfitters. I came across the company through Google and after speaking to him was immediately convinced they were the best partners to help build a client portal. Gifford is a pleasure to work with; his patience and willingness to help bring my vision for a portal to life are greatly appreciated. DNN is brilliant and with the right partner like Atlantic Webfitters it becomes an exceptional piece of Kit. January 7, 2010<br>

Gifford&#39;s Atlantic Webfitters&#39; clients save many thousands of dollars by avoiding the purchase, maintenance, continual replacement and operational support of servers. And they gain access to top of the line software such as SQL database technology, intranet modules for office productivity and content management software, all for a small monthly fee. Additionally, Atlantic Webfitters customers have drastically reduced the need for programmers to make changes to their portals, saving many more thousands of dollars each year. The functionality offered by Atlantic Webfitters&#39; suite of module choices, the ease with which they can be implemented and the low cost make the AWF&#39;s portal solution very attractive. November 20, 2009<br>

Gifford called me over 5 years ago to talk about web consulting. He was very inquisitive and was eager to learn everything he could. He started playing around with some technology, did his research and found the perfect technology for his needs, DotNetNuke. Since starting his company, we have kept in touch and worked on many projects together. You will not find a more dedicated, passionate and skilled person in this industry. I have recommended Gifford many times to some of our clients that are looking for a nice, tight, hosted solution for their portal. Not only does he know his stuff, he is simply a great guy to go have a beer (and Lobster) with. His colourful background, story telling and passion for life makes me proud to call him a friend and colleague. November 20, 2009<br>
