relationships with management teams and internal consultants, <br>
and how to identify the process of change, perform diagnostics, <br>
plan change, implement change and evaluate results.<br>

Facilitation Skills<br>
<br>
This two (2) day course deals with how facilitators help work <br>
groups become more effective.  It is designed to integrate the <br>
theory and practice of group facilitators.   It describes a set <br>
of core values and congruent principles and shows how to use <br>
various techniques to apply the principles in practice.  The <br>
course is designed for employees who want to become or already <br>
are facilitators and for participants who want to use <br>
facilitation skills without formally filling the role.  It will <br>
explore techniques such as Nominal Group Technique and Focus <br>
Group Technique.  It will explore how to begin and end <br>
meetings, helping the group to solve problems, how to set and <br>
follow ground rules, dealing with emotions and working with <br>
other facilitators.  <br>
