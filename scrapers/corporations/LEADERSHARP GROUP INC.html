                            The Leadership Circle™ Profile is the only 360 degree competency assessment that simultaneously provides focused competency feedback while revealing the underlying assumptions that are causing a leaders patterns of strength limitations.<br>
<br>
The LCP reveals a Leader&#39;s Operating System: Internal assumptions (beliefs) that run behavior in both domains.  This allows the manager to see how his/her inner world of thought translates into a productive or unproductive style of leadership.  Ultimately the LCP increases inner awareness that affects outward behavior.  The LCP is the only instrument that measures the two primary leadership domains - Creative Competencies and Reactive Tendencies - and integrates this information so that key opportunities for development immediately rise to the surface.<br>

                            The Leadership System™ is a leadership development system, designed to increase our clients&#39; individual and collective leadership effectiveness.  The Leadership System™ is a system of interlocking and reinforcing components that, taken together, accomplish more than any single-component solution could. The Whole Systems Approach details six interlocking systems (Metrics, Accountability, Communication, Delivery Systems, and Human Performance) that must be tended to during major organizational change.  Ensuring that these six systems are aligned and functioning well is the responsibility of the organization&#39;s leadership, which is itself a system to be continually improved.<br>
<br>
In the Leadership System there are Five Major Components: Pre-Work, The Promise of Leadership Workshop™ , Leader to Leader™, Pulse Surveys™  and One-on-one Coaching.<br>

                            Insights Discovery uses a simple and accessible four colour model to understand an individual’s unique preferences. We measure these preferences based on responses to a short online evaluator. One of the outputs is a 20 page personality profile, which identifies strengths and areas for development.<br>

                            Each of these generations has different attitudes, behaviors, values, skills, abilities, communication preferences, work philosophies and more. These differences generate rich diversity and creativity as well as tension, conflict and miscommunication with other generations that can be significantly disruptive in the workforce.<br>
<br>
Unifying, motivating and developing people from all generations is key to your organization’s success. Increasing your “generational intelligence” will help to manage the varied perspectives and expectations of each generation in your workplace.<br>
<br>
We also focus on individual personality and style of communication because the challenges are rarely just about generational differences.<br>
<br>
Not sure where to start? We can help with our 6 Step &#39;Let&#39;s Work Together!&#39; training program which includes:<br>
<br>
1. Individual profiles and group session to increase the understanding of personality differences and build trust.<br>
2. A Teamwork Assessment and a Generations Assessment which informs all of us about the unique interpersonal dynamics in your group.<br>
   These assessments also allow us to adapt our training to fit your situation.<br>
3. Review of generational differences using our &#39;Managing Different Generations&#39; Guide.<br>
4. Busting myths and misconceptions of each generation. Uncovering strengths and commonalities. Uncovering your real issues.<br>
5. Training on how to hold important conversations.<br>
6. Solving the issues together, setting goals, action steps and accountability. Gaining commitment to change.<br>

                            The creation of a coaching culture in your organization is a powerful transformation.  Research shows that great leaders are good at regularly coaching employees and giving them effective feedback. Younger generations in particular crave this.<br>
<br>
Previously viewed as ‘soft skills’ that many managers dismissed, these are the leadership competencies now regarded as essential, and these skills produce ‘hard’ results in critical areas, including:<br>
<br>
1. Improved employee engagement and motivation<br>
2. Retention of key staff<br>
3. Performance improvement<br>
4. Increased collaboration and innovation<br>
5. Development of future leaders<br>
<br>
We can help you create your coaching culture with a combination of:<br>
<br>
1. Executive Coaching for high potentials, managers and senior leaders <br>
2. Training your leaders in Coaching Skills<br>
3. Selecting and training internal coaches in Coaching Skills <br>
4. Mentor and Supervision Coaching for internal coaches to strengthen and implement their coaching skills<br>
5. Group Coaching to support internal coaches or managers who are adding coaching to their people skills<br>
6. Teaching managers how to use a Coach Approach during feedback conversations<br>

                            The Leadership Circle™ Profile is the only 360 degree competency assessment that simultaneously provides focused competency feedback while revealing the underlying assumptions that are causing a leaders patterns of strength limitations.<br>
<br>
The LCP reveals a Leader&#39;s Operating System: Internal assumptions (beliefs) that run behavior in both domains.  This allows the manager to see how his/her inner world of thought translates into a productive or unproductive style of leadership.  Ultimately the LCP increases inner awareness that affects outward behavior.  The LCP is the only instrument that measures the two primary leadership domains - Creative Competencies and Reactive Tendencies - and integrates this information so that key opportunities for development immediately rise to the surface.<br>

                            The Leadership System™ is a leadership development system, designed to increase our clients&#39; individual and collective leadership effectiveness.  The Leadership System™ is a system of interlocking and reinforcing components that, taken together, accomplish more than any single-component solution could. The Whole Systems Approach details six interlocking systems (Metrics, Accountability, Communication, Delivery Systems, and Human Performance) that must be tended to during major organizational change.  Ensuring that these six systems are aligned and functioning well is the responsibility of the organization&#39;s leadership, which is itself a system to be continually improved.<br>
<br>
In the Leadership System there are Five Major Components: Pre-Work, The Promise of Leadership Workshop™ , Leader to Leader™, Pulse Surveys™  and One-on-one Coaching.<br>

                            Insights Discovery uses a simple and accessible four colour model to understand an individual’s unique preferences. We measure these preferences based on responses to a short online evaluator. One of the outputs is a 20 page personality profile, which identifies strengths and areas for development.<br>

                            Each of these generations has different attitudes, behaviors, values, skills, abilities, communication preferences, work philosophies and more. These differences generate rich diversity and creativity as well as tension, conflict and miscommunication with other generations that can be significantly disruptive in the workforce.<br>
<br>
Unifying, motivating and developing people from all generations is key to your organization’s success. Increasing your “generational intelligence” will help to manage the varied perspectives and expectations of each generation in your workplace.<br>
<br>
We also focus on individual personality and style of communication because the challenges are rarely just about generational differences.<br>
<br>
Not sure where to start? We can help with our 6 Step &#39;Let&#39;s Work Together!&#39; training program which includes:<br>
<br>
1. Individual profiles and group session to increase the understanding of personality differences and build trust.<br>
2. A Teamwork Assessment and a Generations Assessment which informs all of us about the unique interpersonal dynamics in your group.<br>
   These assessments also allow us to adapt our training to fit your situation.<br>
3. Review of generational differences using our &#39;Managing Different Generations&#39; Guide.<br>
4. Busting myths and misconceptions of each generation. Uncovering strengths and commonalities. Uncovering your real issues.<br>
5. Training on how to hold important conversations.<br>
6. Solving the issues together, setting goals, action steps and accountability. Gaining commitment to change.<br>

                            The creation of a coaching culture in your organization is a powerful transformation.  Research shows that great leaders are good at regularly coaching employees and giving them effective feedback. Younger generations in particular crave this.<br>
<br>
Previously viewed as ‘soft skills’ that many managers dismissed, these are the leadership competencies now regarded as essential, and these skills produce ‘hard’ results in critical areas, including:<br>
<br>
1. Improved employee engagement and motivation<br>
2. Retention of key staff<br>
3. Performance improvement<br>
4. Increased collaboration and innovation<br>
5. Development of future leaders<br>
<br>
We can help you create your coaching culture with a combination of:<br>
<br>
1. Executive Coaching for high potentials, managers and senior leaders <br>
2. Training your leaders in Coaching Skills<br>
3. Selecting and training internal coaches in Coaching Skills <br>
4. Mentor and Supervision Coaching for internal coaches to strengthen and implement their coaching skills<br>
5. Group Coaching to support internal coaches or managers who are adding coaching to their people skills<br>
6. Teaching managers how to use a Coach Approach during feedback conversations<br>

1. The course is co-facilitated in order to ensure a high coach to participant ratio in the room, which makes for a rich learning experience.<br>
2. Participants receive a 150 page workbook full of content from the ICF competencies, insights from multiple best in class sources, and exercises that form part of the interactive learning experience.<br>
3. 3 days of training can be held consecutively, however it is optimal to have approximately 2 weeks between the training days. You can choose what works best for you.<br>
4. The training can be followed up with a series of group mentor coaching sessions and/or coaching supervision to embed and build the coaching skills.<br>
5. It is recognized and approved by the ICF, and certified coaches receive continuing education credits for taking the course.<br>
<br>
In this experiential, practice-based course participants will learn:<br>
<br>
1. The structure and flow of coaching conversations<br>
2. How to engage individuals in a coaching conversation that builds trust<br>
3. How to apply key coaching skills and competencies<br>
4. How to ask powerful questions<br>
5. To listen for what is most important<br>
6. Increased observation skills to see and hear with insight<br>
