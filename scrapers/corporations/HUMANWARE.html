                            Victor Reader, the digital talking book players line developed <br>
by VisuAide, allows reading of talking books recorded in digital <br>
format, meaning fast, easy navigation through the structure of a <br>
book. Unlike talking books on cassette, Victor Reader allows you <br>
to jump straight to a specific section or passage in a snap, <br>
skip from page to page, consult the table of contents, even <br>
insert bookmarks, and more. No more rewinding and fast-<br>
forwarding through a cassette to find a specific passage - not <br>
to mention that just one CD can contain a whole book ! In a <br>
word, Victor Readers innovative technology is a genuine <br>
revolution in access to information for print disabled persons.<br>

                            Trekker is a GPS-based orientation and mobility product <br>
for the visually impaired. Trekker is a fully portable <br>
solution that works with various computing platforms such as <br>
Braille note-takers, stand-alone computing platforms and on <br>
personal digital assistant (PDA) devices. It integrates off-the-<br>
shelf hardware for GPS input, voice output to provide <br>
instructions and optional voice input for entering notes. <br>
However, the real advantages of Trekker reside in its <br>
software features and full adaptation to meet the requirements <br>
of the visually impaired. Trekker let the information flow <br>
naturally to the user tracking the proximity of point of <br>
interest and provide vocal information about them and on how to <br>
reach them mix of voice and text contents, geocentric database <br>
search functions path finding and flexibility in allowing the <br>
user to follow loosely a given itinerary.<br>

It verbally announces names of streets, intersections and landmarks as you walk. No need to stop passersby to know where you are... simply press a button and Breeze tells you your location on the spot. When you are in a vehicle, Breeze announces all intersections, allowing you to exit when you want.<br>
<br>
Trekker Breeze lets you:<br>
 Always know where you are and where you are going on foot or in a vehicle<br>
 Know what is around in your location (public services and businesses)<br>
 Easily retrace your steps if you get lost. Simply push a button.<br>
 Record the routes when you learn them with sighted people so that you can use them later without assistance.<br>
 Record landmarks along your route, for example to get to your favorite restaurant or a friends house.<br>
 Get the step-by-step instructions from start to end.<br>

                            The DBC consists of two separate components that deafblind users can easily carry wherever they go. The main unit is the DB BrailleNote which is a BrailleNote mPower (Perkins and QWERTY models available) with special deafblind software installed in it. The companion unit is the DB-Phone which is a special cell phone with a visual display and a QWERTY keyboard that also has unique deafblind software installed in it. These two components communicate wirelessly with each other using Bluetooth. <br>
<br>
Face-to-face Communication Wherever You Go<br>
<br>
DBC users can now communicate with bus drivers, waiters, shop clerks, sighted friends and family, etc. by simply activating a face-to-face chat. By following a simple menu on the DB-BrailleNote, the DB-Phone can be activated and handed to a sighted person. Its easy to keep track of the DB-Phone as it has a retractable security tether. A message is both spoken and displayed on the DB-Phone stating, Hi, Im blind and I cant hear. To communicate with me, type a message on this keyboard and press (the return arrow). Whatever the sighted person types on the DB-Phone in text is sent to the DB-BrailleNote user and displayed in Braille. The DBC user can then type a response on the DB-BrailleNote and send it to the DB-Phone and so the conversation continues.<br>

                            The ScannaR is a flatbed scanner that will scan any text document and read it back to you in seconds.<br>
<br>
Unlike other scan-and-read products, it does not need to be connected to a PC, as it has its own hard drive with room for up to 500,000 pages of text, making it one of the most portable scan-and-read products on the market.<br>
<br>
ScannaR allows you to read anything from letters and brochures to newspapers, reports, books or other print materials, and then save them for future reference. <br>
<br>
ScannaR is not only great for the home or office. It is an ideal tool for educators and students at all levels for quickly scanning and recording textbooks, worksheets, tests and exams. Because of its audio output as well as the bonus ability to download files to a BrailleNote or VoiceNote, it is suitable for environments where resources are shared among students who either have low vision or are blind. <br>

                            Victor Reader, the digital talking book players line developed <br>
by VisuAide, allows reading of talking books recorded in digital <br>
format, meaning fast, easy navigation through the structure of a <br>
book. Unlike talking books on cassette, Victor Reader allows you <br>
to jump straight to a specific section or passage in a snap, <br>
skip from page to page, consult the table of contents, even <br>
insert bookmarks, and more. No more rewinding and fast-<br>
forwarding through a cassette to find a specific passage - not <br>
to mention that just one CD can contain a whole book ! In a <br>
word, Victor Readers innovative technology is a genuine <br>
revolution in access to information for print disabled persons.<br>

It verbally announces names of streets, intersections and landmarks as you walk. No need to stop passersby to know where you are... simply press a button and Breeze tells you your location on the spot. When you are in a vehicle, Breeze announces all intersections, allowing you to exit when you want.<br>
<br>

 Always know where you are and where you are going on foot or in a vehicle<br>
 Know what is around in your location (public services and businesses)<br>
 Easily retrace your steps if you get lost. Simply push a button.<br>
 Record the routes when you learn them with sighted people so that you can use them later without assistance.<br>
 Record landmarks along your route, for example to get to your favorite restaurant or a friends house.<br>
 Get the step-by-step instructions from start to end.<br>

                            The DBC consists of two separate components that deafblind users can easily carry wherever they go. The main unit is the DB BrailleNote which is a BrailleNote mPower (Perkins and QWERTY models available) with special deafblind software installed in it. The companion unit is the DB-Phone which is a special cell phone with a visual display and a QWERTY keyboard that also has unique deafblind software installed in it. These two components communicate wirelessly with each other using Bluetooth. <br>
<br>
Face-to-face Communication Wherever You Go<br>
<br>
DBC users can now communicate with bus drivers, waiters, shop clerks, sighted friends and family, etc. by simply activating a face-to-face chat. By following a simple menu on the DB-BrailleNote, the DB-Phone can be activated and handed to a sighted person. Its easy to keep track of the DB-Phone as it has a retractable security tether. A message is both spoken and displayed on the DB-Phone stating, Hi, Im blind and I cant hear. To communicate with me, type a message on this keyboard and press (the return arrow). Whatever the sighted person types on the DB-Phone in text is sent to the DB-BrailleNote user and displayed in Braille. The DBC user can then type a response on the DB-BrailleNote and send it to the DB-Phone and so the conversation continues.<br>

                            The ScannaR is a flatbed scanner that will scan any text document and read it back to you in seconds.<br>
<br>
Unlike other scan-and-read products, it does not need to be connected to a PC, as it has its own hard drive with room for up to 500,000 pages of text, making it one of the most portable scan-and-read products on the market.<br>
<br>
ScannaR allows you to read anything from letters and brochures to newspapers, reports, books or other print materials, and then save them for future reference. <br>
<br>
ScannaR is not only great for the home or office. It is an ideal tool for educators and students at all levels for quickly scanning and recording textbooks, worksheets, tests and exams. Because of its audio output as well as the bonus ability to download files to a BrailleNote or VoiceNote, it is suitable for environments where resources are shared among students who either have low vision or are blind. <br>
