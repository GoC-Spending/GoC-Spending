                            For those involved, a car accident can be one of the most traumatic events they will ever go through. Not only do victims have to deal with the immediate pain and suffering that a motor vehicle accident can cause, but they may also have to contend with the loss of income for time taken off of work and long-term disabilities that can haunt them for years after the accident. In accidents that lead to death, both the emotional grief and potential loss of income of the deceased person are factors that family members and loved ones will have to struggle to deal with long after the accident itself.<br>

If you&#39;ve been injured in a car accident, the personal injury lawyers at Diamond &amp; Diamond can help you with the process of filing a claim.<br>

                            Brain injuries are often some of the most damaging and difficult types of injuries that people have to deal with, but because of their specific nature they can often be difficult to spot. Unlike injuries to bones and tissue that tend to heal over time, brain injuries can last a lifetime and lead to major changes in a person’s personality and quality of life. Because this type of injury may take weeks or even months to manifest, many people who suffer a brain injury in an accident are not aware that anything is wrong until much later. Furthermore, because of the nature of the brain, medical diagnoses may be imprecise. All of these complications mean it is vital to have the representation of a personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond who understands the specific nature of brain injury cases.<br>

                            Work-related injuries and deaths are all too common in Ontario, with thousands of employees suffering some form of work-related injury in the province every year. While certain professions, such as construction and manufacturing involving heavy machinery, are more prone to injuries than others, even people who typically work in offices or at a desk can suffer an unforeseen injury while on the job. Workers’ compensation laws in Ontario are notoriously complex and there are often strict statutes of limitations that injured employees must abide by in order to receive their fair share of compensation. Having a personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond at hand who understands workers&#39; compensation will help you ease through the process.<br>

                            While all personal injury cases are likely to be traumatic for victims and loved ones, there are few cases that leave as much grief and heartache in their wake as those that result in a wrongful death. Family members and friends of the deceased are likely to struggle deeply with the sudden loss of a loved one, and that emotional trauma is only compounded if the death also leads to a loss of income formerly provided by the loved one. People should not have to cope alone with the wrongful death of someone they loved, and holding the negligent party accountable can at least help relieve the financial burden of the loss. Due to the seriousness of a wrongful death claim, it is necessary to seek the guidance of a qualified personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond when pursuing such a claim.<br>

                            The vast majority of animal bites are by dogs, however cats, horses, and even exotic animals at zoos are occasionally involved. While many dog bites are likely to heal quickly, in serious cases, the injuries can be so severe that they lead to permanent disfigurement and require surgery. Unfortunately, children are the most common victims of dog attacks because of their natural curiousity, and often, and under appreciation of the threat a dog can pose. Because of their small size, children are also more likely to suffer more extensive and serious injuries in an attack than those typically sustained by an adult. Aside from the physical injuries sustained in an attack, dog bites can also lead to emotional trauma, especially for young children who may develop phobias of dogs and other animals that carry through into adulthood. Because of Ontario’s strict liability laws surrounding dog owners, any victim of a dog bite should contact a personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond to see what form of compensation may be available.<br>

                            The physical pain and emotional anguish often associated with long-term disabilities are likely to be the most important considerations for sufferers. Unfortunately, the disability itself is not the only thing injured people have to worry about. Such an injury is likely to mean that the sufferer will not be able to return to work for an extended period of time, in many cases for the rest of their life. This loss of income would be hard enough for any person to endure, but because disabilities usually entail high medical costs as well, being without an income is even more serious for those suffering from a long-term disability. Due to these costs, qualifying for a long-term disability claim is vital for many disabled people. Being denied a claim or having payments stopped prematurely can lead to stress and worry. It is important to have a personal injury lawyer at Diamond &amp; Diamond who knows how to fight for the reinstatement of a denied long-term disability claim.<br>

                            When you sign a retainer with a lawyer, you are asking that lawyer to act on your behalf. However, signing a retainer does not mean you are bound to that lawyer for the duration of your case. Clients are allowed to fire their lawyers at any time for any reason. Conversely, lawyers are not allowed to fire their clients without reason. They may end the relationship for a variety of reasons; the most common being an inability to communicate.  <br>

                            For those involved, a car accident can be one of the most traumatic events they will ever go through. Not only do victims have to deal with the immediate pain and suffering that a motor vehicle accident can cause, but they may also have to contend with the loss of income for time taken off of work and long-term disabilities that can haunt them for years after the accident. In accidents that lead to death, both the emotional grief and potential loss of income of the deceased person are factors that family members and loved ones will have to struggle to deal with long after the accident itself.<br>

If you&#39;ve been injured in a car accident, the personal injury lawyers at Diamond &amp; Diamond can help you with the process of filing a claim.<br>

                            Brain injuries are often some of the most damaging and difficult types of injuries that people have to deal with, but because of their specific nature they can often be difficult to spot. Unlike injuries to bones and tissue that tend to heal over time, brain injuries can last a lifetime and lead to major changes in a person’s personality and quality of life. Because this type of injury may take weeks or even months to manifest, many people who suffer a brain injury in an accident are not aware that anything is wrong until much later. Furthermore, because of the nature of the brain, medical diagnoses may be imprecise. All of these complications mean it is vital to have the representation of a personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond who understands the specific nature of brain injury cases.<br>

                            Work-related injuries and deaths are all too common in Ontario, with thousands of employees suffering some form of work-related injury in the province every year. While certain professions, such as construction and manufacturing involving heavy machinery, are more prone to injuries than others, even people who typically work in offices or at a desk can suffer an unforeseen injury while on the job. Workers’ compensation laws in Ontario are notoriously complex and there are often strict statutes of limitations that injured employees must abide by in order to receive their fair share of compensation. Having a personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond at hand who understands workers&#39; compensation will help you ease through the process.<br>

                            While all personal injury cases are likely to be traumatic for victims and loved ones, there are few cases that leave as much grief and heartache in their wake as those that result in a wrongful death. Family members and friends of the deceased are likely to struggle deeply with the sudden loss of a loved one, and that emotional trauma is only compounded if the death also leads to a loss of income formerly provided by the loved one. People should not have to cope alone with the wrongful death of someone they loved, and holding the negligent party accountable can at least help relieve the financial burden of the loss. Due to the seriousness of a wrongful death claim, it is necessary to seek the guidance of a qualified personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond when pursuing such a claim.<br>

                            The vast majority of animal bites are by dogs, however cats, horses, and even exotic animals at zoos are occasionally involved. While many dog bites are likely to heal quickly, in serious cases, the injuries can be so severe that they lead to permanent disfigurement and require surgery. Unfortunately, children are the most common victims of dog attacks because of their natural curiousity, and often, and under appreciation of the threat a dog can pose. Because of their small size, children are also more likely to suffer more extensive and serious injuries in an attack than those typically sustained by an adult. Aside from the physical injuries sustained in an attack, dog bites can also lead to emotional trauma, especially for young children who may develop phobias of dogs and other animals that carry through into adulthood. Because of Ontario’s strict liability laws surrounding dog owners, any victim of a dog bite should contact a personal injury lawyer from Diamond &amp; Diamond to see what form of compensation may be available.<br>

                            The physical pain and emotional anguish often associated with long-term disabilities are likely to be the most important considerations for sufferers. Unfortunately, the disability itself is not the only thing injured people have to worry about. Such an injury is likely to mean that the sufferer will not be able to return to work for an extended period of time, in many cases for the rest of their life. This loss of income would be hard enough for any person to endure, but because disabilities usually entail high medical costs as well, being without an income is even more serious for those suffering from a long-term disability. Due to these costs, qualifying for a long-term disability claim is vital for many disabled people. Being denied a claim or having payments stopped prematurely can lead to stress and worry. It is important to have a personal injury lawyer at Diamond &amp; Diamond who knows how to fight for the reinstatement of a denied long-term disability claim.<br>

                            When you sign a retainer with a lawyer, you are asking that lawyer to act on your behalf. However, signing a retainer does not mean you are bound to that lawyer for the duration of your case. Clients are allowed to fire their lawyers at any time for any reason. Conversely, lawyers are not allowed to fire their clients without reason. They may end the relationship for a variety of reasons; the most common being an inability to communicate.  <br>
<br>
The complaints we hear the most often are that the person is unsure of the advice that they are being given, or that they are just unhappy with how their lawyer is handling their case. If you are feeling frustrated, you should know that there are options. Diamond &amp; Diamond™ will give you a free second opinion. If you are unhappy with your lawyer, call us to discuss your options, and we will guide you towards an informed decision. We provide this service free of charge because we fundamentally believe that lawyers are here to serve the public. If you have questions, contact us today.<br>
