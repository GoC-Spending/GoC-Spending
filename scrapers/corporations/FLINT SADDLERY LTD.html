        <br>            Flint Original Hospital Felt had its origin in 1989 when David <br>Flint, the owner of Flint Saddlery, was asked by concerned <br>professional equestrian people (English and Western disciplines) <br>whose horses are used many hours daily to find a solution to <br>such problems as scalding, fibrosis and ulceration resulting in <br>the horses being unusable for days.  David experimented with <br>many different pad materials currently on the market but none <br>solved the problem.  One day while visiting a friend in the <br>hospital who had been bedridden for six months, David remarked <br>that he must have bedsores.  The friend explained that there <br>were no bedsores because of the special hospital felt pad that <br>was under him.  The mill that produced the pad was contacted, <br>modifications to the milling process were discussed and the <br>first Flint Original Hospital Felt pad with its many <br>therapeutic properties was produced.  In fact, Flint Saddlery, <br>has an exclusive agreement with the mill for this felt product <br>which is grey in colour.  The grey colour makes it easy to <br>distinguish the Flint Original Hospital Felt from other common <br>polyester orthopaedic or sports hospital felts.<br><br>Flint Original Hospital Felt is not the polyester orthopaedic <br>or sports hospital felts that are found in most tack stores and <br>most commonly used in sports and equestrian equipment.  Flint <br>Original Hospital Felt contains no coatings or finishes to <br>prevent air circulation and dissipation of heat and moisture <br>from the horse&#39;s body.  The fibre loops mesh with the horse&#39;s <br>coat to prevent slippage under the saddle.  Due to the high <br>content of special fibre, not found in sports felt, Flint <br>Original Hospital Felt offers excellent protective and <br>therapeutic qualities.<br><br>The Flint Original Hospital Felt pad has excellent shock <br>absorption value and the main advantage is its ability to absorb <br>and wick both moisture and heat away from the horse&#39;s body.  The <br>short fibres work with the horse&#39;s coat resulting in much less <br>slippage.  Bacteria won&#39;t grow in the pad.  You will find that <br>your horse is much drier under the pad after a ride.   These <br>qualities are retained after extended use and enhanced by <br>frequent washing.<br><br>Flint Saddlery has also developed Two-Piece Western/Ropers <br>cinches and Two-Piece English and Australian girths with <br>removable felt pads for easy washing. Exclusively developed by <br>Flint Saddlery with the narrow-built horse in mind are the <br>Two-Piece Western Contoured Cinch® and the Two-Piece English <br>Contoured Girth® also with removable felt pads for easy washing. <br>The removable felt pad is easy to keep clean and exchangeable <br>which helps to prevent the spread of skin diseases from horse to <br>horse when working several horses a day.<br><br>Other fine equestrian products that offer the Flint Original <br>Hospital Felt therapeutic properties are the Western, English <br>and Australian saddle pads and Orthopaedic saddle pads, <br>under-blanket pads, breast collars and training surcingles.<br><br>David Flint is constantly experimenting and subsequently <br>up-dating his equestrian products.  His commitment to top <br>quality and innovation is evident in the complete line of Flint <br>Saddlery equestrian products.<br><br>Flint Saddlery is currently exporting to Australia and the <br>United States.  <br><br>Flint Saddlery is exhibiting at the CAN-AM Show, Spruce Meadows, <br>Alberta, in Spring and in Fall of each year.<br><br>In addition to trade shows, we publish a quarterly Newsletter <br>which is distributed via direct mailing to our current <br>customers. If you would like to receive this Newsletter please <br>contact us.<br><br>We also manufacture in addition to our line of Original Hospital <br>Felt equestrian products, equestrian products with Neoprene.  <br>Our equestrian products with Neoprene are trademarked as &quot;FOR <br>WINNERS ONLY&quot;!<br>

                            How and why was the Flint Original Hospital Felt pad developed?<br>
David Flint did not set out to manufacture felt pads but in 1989 <br>
he was asked by concerned professional equestrian people <br>
(English and Western discipline) to help them solve the problem <br>
of their horses getting sore backs from being ridden long hours <br>
every day. <br>
David spent about a year trying all the various pads on the <br>
market, even importing several from Europe.  The sore back <br>
problems persisted.  Then he discovered a special felt pad being <br>
used in the hospital bed of a friend.  He contacted the mill and <br>
made up a sample pad.  It helped the horses.  He worked with the <br>
mill on some changes to their felting process to make the <br>
product better for use with horses.  The final product worked <br>
well and became the only pad many professional equestrian people <br>
now use.   Other customers heard of the value of the pad and <br>
David began custom making the pad for them.  Thus a new sideline <br>
to his regular saddle making business began from his willingness <br>
to help the professional equestrian people.<br>
<br>
What makes the Flint Original Hospital Felt pad different from <br>
all those other &quot;hospital felt&quot; pads?<br>
What other manufacturers call &quot;hospital felt&quot; is really <br>
orthopaedic or sports felt.  It is made up of long polyester <br>
fibres which will slip on the horse&#39;s back,  generate heat and <br>
has hardly any absorption, wicking or heat dissipation values.  <br>
Flint Original Hospital Felt is made up of a very high <br>
percentage of short man-made fibre with the same qualities as <br>
natural fibre together with excellent absorption, wicking and <br>
heat dissipation properties.  It requires a special <br>
manufacturing process to make this felt, resulting in a raw <br>
product cost considerable greater than orthopaedic felt.  We <br>
know of no other pad manufacturer that uses this grade of felt, <br>
in fact, Flint Saddlery, has an exclusive agreement with the <br>
mill for this felt product.<br>
<br>
How can I tell the difference?<br>
Visually, it is tough.  However, there are two simple tests you <br>
can perform. Rubbing your knuckles hard on orthopaedic or sports <br>
felt will generate a considerable amount of heat.  A similar <br>
rubbing on Flint Original Hospital Felt will result in hardly <br>
any heat generation.  Holding a flame to the edge of other felt <br>
pads will cause the pad to melt, revealing that it is really a <br>
type of plastic.  The same flame test will cause the Flint <br>
Original Hospital Felt pad to burn, similar to a natural fibre. <br>
The easiest way to ensure you are getting the Flint Original <br>
Hospital Felt pad is to look for the Flint Saddlery Bucking <br>
Bronco Logo ®.<br>
<br>
How will a Flint Original Hospital Felt pad help my horse?<br>
The pad has excellent shock absorption value and the main <br>
advantage is its ability to absorb and wick both moisture and <br>
heat away from the horse&#39;s body.  The short fibres work with the <br>
horse&#39;s coat resulting in much less slippage.  Bacteria won&#39;t <br>
grow in the pad.  You will find that your horse is much drier <br>
under the pad after a ride.  Remember after the Flint Original <br>
Hospital Felt pad was developed, endurance riders, professional <br>
packers and outfitters have reported instant success when <br>
switching to the Flint pads.<br>
<br>
How do I keep the felt pads clean?<br>
They wash beautifully.  We recommend vacuuming off all the horse <br>
hair and washing the 1 pads in the triple loaders at the <br>
laundromat.  The 1/4&quot; and 1/2&quot; saddle pads, cinch, girth and <br>
breast collar pads can be washed in the machine at home.  Wash <br>
in luke warm water and machine dry at very low heat.  (High heat <br>
won&#39;t harm the felt but it will cause the nylon wear strips on <br>
the pads to wrinkle and shrink.)  Washing actually enhances <br>
performance and increases loft.  NEW PADS SHOULD BE WASHED <br>
BEFORE USE.  <br>

                            ENGLISH / DRESSAGE SADDLE PADS<br>
The durable, shock absorbent saddle pads are manufactured from <br>
Flint Original Hospital Felt in 3/8 thickness.  The pads are <br>
protected by cotton cover with bound edges in black.  For a <br>
dressier pad, 100% cotton cloth in a Classic English Design <br>
(CED) may be specified.  The under blanket pads are designed for <br>
use under a Flint pad for cleanliness and additional protection. <br>
Under blanket pads are plain with no trim.  The felt is grey and <br>
pads are machine washable and dryable. For English Orthopaedic <br>
saddle pads, please refer to Orthopaedic pads.<br>
<br>
WESTERN / ROPERS / PACKERS SADDLE PADS<br>
The Flint Original Hospital Felt is at its best when used in <br>
the saddle pads David makes for Western riding.  Its many <br>
features may be reviewed on the first page and the Questions &amp; <br>
Answers  section.  Western/Ropers pads come in three <br>
thicknesses (1&quot;, 1/2&quot;, 1/4&quot;) determined by usage.  The Western, <br>
Ropers and Packers saddle pads are covered on the wear area with <br>
heavy duty natural or black canvas.  For a dressier pad, 100% <br>
cotton heavy duty cloth in a South-western Design may be <br>
specified.  All under blanket pads come without wear pads and <br>
are designed for use under a Flint pad or Navajo blanket for <br>
cleanliness and additional protection.  Advise of special sizes <br>
for under blanket pads or if wear leathers are needed. For <br>
Western/Ropers Orthopaedic saddle pads, please refer to <br>
Orthopaedic pads.<br>
<br>
AUSTRALIAN SADDLE PADS<br>
The Australian saddle pads have the same features and <br>
colour options as our English pads but are shaped to <br>
fit the Australian saddle.<br>

                            TWO-PIECE WESTERN  / ROPERS CINCHES<br>
These are the strongest and best made cinches on the market <br>
today.  The cinches are worked in an unique way that took David <br>
a long time to develop.  David starts with a super strong nylon <br>
strap that he sews five times to gather it slightly, putting in <br>
a small amount of stretch to eliminate blown muscles from over <br>
cinching.  Heavy duty stainless steel buckles are used at each <br>
end. The Western Contoured Cinch® was designed with the narrow-<br>
built horse in mind and helps eliminate rubbing at the elbows. A <br>
1/2&quot; Flint Original Hospital Felt pad is attached with velcro <br>
full length for its therapeutic value.  The removable pad is <br>
easy to clean and exchangeable which helps to prevent the spread <br>
of skin diseases when working several horses a day.<br>
<br>
TWO-PIECE ENGLISH / DRESSAGE GIRTHS<br>
The therapeutic girth designed by David is extremely strong and <br>
yet gentle to the horse. The English Girth has elastic buckle <br>
connections on one end.  The English Contoured Girth® was <br>
designed with the narrow-built horse in mind and helps eliminate <br>
rubbing at the elbows.  Available in black (30). A 1/2&quot; Flint <br>
Original Hospital Felt pad is attached with velcro full length <br>
for its therapeutic value.  The removable pad is easy to clean <br>
and exchangeable which helps to prevent the spread of skin <br>
diseases when working several horses a day.<br>
<br>
TWO-PIECE WESTERN / ROPERS BREAST PLATES<br>
These breast plates virtually eliminate the chafing and galling <br>
problems associated with leather or fuzzy nylon covered types.  <br>
David builds his by using the same strength nylon webbing found <br>
in his cinches.  They are designed with removable Flint Original <br>
Hospital Felt pads attached to all areas that contact the <br>
horse. <br>
Two styles are available:  The traditional &quot;Y&quot; shape with three <br>
parts fastened to a stainless O-ring or a single piece type <br>
sometimes favoured by backcountry riders and packers.  Available <br>
in brown, black or South-western design.<br>

                            Some professional packer friends of David asked him to make them <br>
saddle bags that could stand up to long backcountry trips and <br>
defy being ripped when scrapped against countless trees.  The <br>
result is a super tough waterproof bag with easy to use velcro <br>
flaps to seal them from the weather. No more sandwiches tasting <br>
like horse sweat or soggy clothes.  A unique design allows the <br>
bags to be adjusted to the horse&#39;s size.  Available in brown and <br>
black .  For those who like their equipment a little bit <br>
fancier, flaps with South-western design may be specified.<br>

                            With a Flint Saddlery pack, your pack horse can manoeuvre <br>
through treed areas with considerable more ease than with <br>
traditional boxes.  These packs are made out of an extremely <br>
tough material that is interlaced with a heavy duty nylon <br>
thread.  They will withstand many encounters with the roughest <br>
tree bark.  Soft pacs are made to fit over both a traditional <br>
western saddle and a sawbuck.  Models W6415 and W6420 can even <br>
be rolled up and tied to the back of the saddle and used to <br>
carry out game. Available in hunter orange.<br>

                            Magnetized Cinch / Girth / Saddle Pad<br>
<br>
Magnetic therapy relaxes tense muscles, relieves muscular and skeletal pain, and accelerates the healing process for injuries of muscular and skeletal nature.  The treatment involves the placing of a magnetized pad of the correct configuration on the affected area, allowing the affected area to heal itself, especially in the case of sore muscles, spinal and chest tissue.<br>
<br>
The magnetic fields are useful forms of physical therapy.  They easily penetrate deeply into the tissue which causes an increase in blood flow to facilitate the natural healing process as well as an increase in the removal of toxins from the affected area.  Use magnetized pads to<br>
<br>
~ increase blood circulation ~<br>
~ stimulate tissue healing ~<br>
~ relieve inflammation and pain ~<br>
<br>
Magni-Kure pads contain no strips or discs sewn into the magnetic pads in the saddle pads and cinch/girth pads because the magnets are evenly distributed in the neoprene pads resulting in uniform application of the magnetic fields across the entire pad with no gaps, bulges, or irregular surfaces with Gauss levels of 120 - 200.  The Magni-Kure pad retains body heat in affected area to facilitate the healing process.  The magnetic pads are removable for easy washing and cleaning.<br>

                            How and why was the Flint Original Hospital Felt pad developed?<br>
David Flint did not set out to manufacture felt pads but in 1989 <br>
he was asked by concerned professional equestrian people <br>
(English and Western discipline) to help them solve the problem <br>
of their horses getting sore backs from being ridden long hours <br>
every day. <br>
David spent about a year trying all the various pads on the <br>
market, even importing several from Europe.  The sore back <br>
problems persisted.  Then he discovered a special felt pad being <br>
used in the hospital bed of a friend.  He contacted the mill and <br>
made up a sample pad.  It helped the horses.  He worked with the <br>
mill on some changes to their felting process to make the <br>
product better for use with horses.  The final product worked <br>
well and became the only pad many professional equestrian people <br>
now use.   Other customers heard of the value of the pad and <br>
David began custom making the pad for them.  Thus a new sideline <br>
to his regular saddle making business began from his willingness <br>
to help the professional equestrian people.<br>
<br>
What makes the Flint Original Hospital Felt pad different from <br>
all those other &quot;hospital felt&quot; pads?<br>
What other manufacturers call &quot;hospital felt&quot; is really <br>
orthopaedic or sports felt.  It is made up of long polyester <br>
fibres which will slip on the horse&#39;s back,  generate heat and <br>
has hardly any absorption, wicking or heat dissipation values.  <br>
Flint Original Hospital Felt is made up of a very high <br>
percentage of short man-made fibre with the same qualities as <br>
natural fibre together with excellent absorption, wicking and <br>
heat dissipation properties.  It requires a special <br>
manufacturing process to make this felt, resulting in a raw <br>
product cost considerable greater than orthopaedic felt.  We <br>
know of no other pad manufacturer that uses this grade of felt, <br>
in fact, Flint Saddlery, has an exclusive agreement with the <br>
mill for this felt product.<br>
<br>
How can I tell the difference?<br>
Visually, it is tough.  However, there are two simple tests you <br>
can perform. Rubbing your knuckles hard on orthopaedic or sports <br>
felt will generate a considerable amount of heat.  A similar <br>
rubbing on Flint Original Hospital Felt will result in hardly <br>
any heat generation.  Holding a flame to the edge of other felt <br>
pads will cause the pad to melt, revealing that it is really a <br>
type of plastic.  The same flame test will cause the Flint <br>
Original Hospital Felt pad to burn, similar to a natural fibre. <br>
The easiest way to ensure you are getting the Flint Original <br>
Hospital Felt pad is to look for the Flint Saddlery Bucking <br>
Bronco Logo ®.<br>
<br>
How will a Flint Original Hospital Felt pad help my horse?<br>
The pad has excellent shock absorption value and the main <br>
advantage is its ability to absorb and wick both moisture and <br>
heat away from the horse&#39;s body.  The short fibres work with the <br>
horse&#39;s coat resulting in much less slippage.  Bacteria won&#39;t <br>
grow in the pad.  You will find that your horse is much drier <br>
under the pad after a ride.  Remember after the Flint Original <br>
Hospital Felt pad was developed, endurance riders, professional <br>
packers and outfitters have reported instant success when <br>
switching to the Flint pads.<br>
<br>
How do I keep the felt pads clean?<br>
They wash beautifully.  We recommend vacuuming off all the horse <br>
hair and washing the 1 pads in the triple loaders at the <br>
laundromat.  The 1/4&quot; and 1/2&quot; saddle pads, cinch, girth and <br>
breast collar pads can be washed in the machine at home.  Wash <br>
in luke warm water and machine dry at very low heat.  (High heat <br>
won&#39;t harm the felt but it will cause the nylon wear strips on <br>
the pads to wrinkle and shrink.)  Washing actually enhances <br>
performance and increases loft.  NEW PADS SHOULD BE WASHED <br>
BEFORE USE.  <br>

                            ENGLISH / DRESSAGE SADDLE PADS<br>
The durable, shock absorbent saddle pads are manufactured from <br>
Flint Original Hospital Felt in 3/8 thickness.  The pads are <br>
protected by cotton cover with bound edges in black.  For a <br>
dressier pad, 100% cotton cloth in a Classic English Design <br>
(CED) may be specified.  The under blanket pads are designed for <br>
use under a Flint pad for cleanliness and additional protection. <br>
Under blanket pads are plain with no trim.  The felt is grey and <br>
pads are machine washable and dryable. For English Orthopaedic <br>
saddle pads, please refer to Orthopaedic pads.<br>
<br>
WESTERN / ROPERS / PACKERS SADDLE PADS<br>
The Flint Original Hospital Felt is at its best when used in <br>
the saddle pads David makes for Western riding.  Its many <br>
features may be reviewed on the first page and the Questions &amp; <br>
Answers  section.  Western/Ropers pads come in three <br>
thicknesses (1&quot;, 1/2&quot;, 1/4&quot;) determined by usage.  The Western, <br>
Ropers and Packers saddle pads are covered on the wear area with <br>
heavy duty natural or black canvas.  For a dressier pad, 100% <br>
cotton heavy duty cloth in a South-western Design may be <br>
specified.  All under blanket pads come without wear pads and <br>
are designed for use under a Flint pad or Navajo blanket for <br>
cleanliness and additional protection.  Advise of special sizes <br>
for under blanket pads or if wear leathers are needed. For <br>
Western/Ropers Orthopaedic saddle pads, please refer to <br>
Orthopaedic pads.<br>
<br>
AUSTRALIAN SADDLE PADS<br>
The Australian saddle pads have the same features and <br>
colour options as our English pads but are shaped to <br>
fit the Australian saddle.<br>

                            TWO-PIECE WESTERN  / ROPERS CINCHES<br>
These are the strongest and best made cinches on the market <br>
today.  The cinches are worked in an unique way that took David <br>
a long time to develop.  David starts with a super strong nylon <br>
strap that he sews five times to gather it slightly, putting in <br>
a small amount of stretch to eliminate blown muscles from over <br>
cinching.  Heavy duty stainless steel buckles are used at each <br>
end. The Western Contoured Cinch® was designed with the narrow-<br>
built horse in mind and helps eliminate rubbing at the elbows. A <br>
1/2&quot; Flint Original Hospital Felt pad is attached with velcro <br>
full length for its therapeutic value.  The removable pad is <br>
easy to clean and exchangeable which helps to prevent the spread <br>
of skin diseases when working several horses a day.<br>
<br>
TWO-PIECE ENGLISH / DRESSAGE GIRTHS<br>
The therapeutic girth designed by David is extremely strong and <br>
yet gentle to the horse. The English Girth has elastic buckle <br>
connections on one end.  The English Contoured Girth® was <br>
designed with the narrow-built horse in mind and helps eliminate <br>
rubbing at the elbows.  Available in black (30). A 1/2&quot; Flint <br>
Original Hospital Felt pad is attached with velcro full length <br>
for its therapeutic value.  The removable pad is easy to clean <br>
and exchangeable which helps to prevent the spread of skin <br>
diseases when working several horses a day.<br>
<br>
TWO-PIECE WESTERN / ROPERS BREAST PLATES<br>
These breast plates virtually eliminate the chafing and galling <br>
problems associated with leather or fuzzy nylon covered types.  <br>
David builds his by using the same strength nylon webbing found <br>
in his cinches.  They are designed with removable Flint Original <br>
Hospital Felt pads attached to all areas that contact the <br>
horse. <br>
Two styles are available:  The traditional &quot;Y&quot; shape with three <br>
parts fastened to a stainless O-ring or a single piece type <br>
sometimes favoured by backcountry riders and packers.  Available <br>
in brown, black or South-western design.<br>

                            Some professional packer friends of David asked him to make them <br>
saddle bags that could stand up to long backcountry trips and <br>
defy being ripped when scrapped against countless trees.  The <br>
result is a super tough waterproof bag with easy to use velcro <br>
flaps to seal them from the weather. No more sandwiches tasting <br>
like horse sweat or soggy clothes.  A unique design allows the <br>
bags to be adjusted to the horse&#39;s size.  Available in brown and <br>
black .  For those who like their equipment a little bit <br>
fancier, flaps with South-western design may be specified.<br>

                            With a Flint Saddlery pack, your pack horse can manoeuvre <br>
through treed areas with considerable more ease than with <br>
traditional boxes.  These packs are made out of an extremely <br>
tough material that is interlaced with a heavy duty nylon <br>
thread.  They will withstand many encounters with the roughest <br>
tree bark.  Soft pacs are made to fit over both a traditional <br>
western saddle and a sawbuck.  Models W6415 and W6420 can even <br>
be rolled up and tied to the back of the saddle and used to <br>
carry out game. Available in hunter orange.<br>

                            Magnetized Cinch / Girth / Saddle Pad<br>
<br>
Magnetic therapy relaxes tense muscles, relieves muscular and skeletal pain, and accelerates the healing process for injuries of muscular and skeletal nature.  The treatment involves the placing of a magnetized pad of the correct configuration on the affected area, allowing the affected area to heal itself, especially in the case of sore muscles, spinal and chest tissue.<br>
<br>
The magnetic fields are useful forms of physical therapy.  They easily penetrate deeply into the tissue which causes an increase in blood flow to facilitate the natural healing process as well as an increase in the removal of toxins from the affected area.  Use magnetized pads to<br>
<br>
~ increase blood circulation ~<br>
~ stimulate tissue healing ~<br>
~ relieve inflammation and pain ~<br>
<br>
Magni-Kure pads contain no strips or discs sewn into the magnetic pads in the saddle pads and cinch/girth pads because the magnets are evenly distributed in the neoprene pads resulting in uniform application of the magnetic fields across the entire pad with no gaps, bulges, or irregular surfaces with Gauss levels of 120 - 200.  The Magni-Kure pad retains body heat in affected area to facilitate the healing process.  The magnetic pads are removable for easy washing and cleaning.<br>
