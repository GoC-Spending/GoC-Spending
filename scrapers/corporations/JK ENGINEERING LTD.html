        <br>            J.K. Engineering Ltd. is a civil engineering consulting company <br>specializing in environmental projects which J.K. Engineering Ltd. is a civil engineering consulting company, established in 1987 and  specializing in civil and environmental projects which include water supply, wastewater disposal, solid and hazardous waste disposal and environmental impact studies.<br><br>J.K. Engineering Ltd. has performed aver 50 projects related to water supply and wastewater disposal for domestic and industrial uses.<br><br>The projects include a wide range of engineering services such as feasibility studies, preliminary and detailed design, construction supervision and project management, operating and maintenance manuals, staff training, operation monitoring, regulatory approvals, and complete turn key projects including construction.<br><br>The projects include small to large municipal, industrial and recreational, and individual residential wastewater treatment, disposal &amp; re-use systems.<br><br>A major component of the projects executed was compliance with environmental and safety regulatory requirements, including field soils and hydrogeological testing for agricultural and environmental reasons.  Also, each project includes detailed operation procedures and operation staff training.<br><br>The projects complied with very stringent Canadian Federal and Provincial Regulations and Guidelines for Design, Implementation and Operation Monitoring and Reporting.<br><br>Also, we are familiar with the European Union Environmental Regulations regarding Wastewater Treatment, Disposal and Re-use through our operation in Poland.<br><br>The projects completed include complex water and wastewater treatment processes such as removal of high concentration of inorganic and organic compounds from surface and groundwater sources, tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater with biological and chemical processes and disinfection with ozone and UV radiation and complex industrial wastewater treatment for BOD, COD, suspended solids, oil and grease, phenol and heavy metal removal and pH adjustment. New, but economical solutions are always employed to satisfy the water and wastewater quality standards.<br><br>Several projects involved benchscale testing and pilot plant studies for development of water and wastewater treatment processes. New processes such as ozonation, activated carbon adsorption, UV radiation and special chemical treatments have been tested for a variety of applications which include removal of heavy metals, dissolved organic carbon, suspended solids, colour, oil and grease, pH adjustment, and taste and odour control.<br><br>The wastewater (sewage) treatment processes include conventional lagoons, aerated lagoons, conventional activated sludge process and several novel activated sludge processes and rotating biological contactors, sludge digestion (anaerobic with bio-gas recovery and use, and aerobic), sludge drying beds and mechanical sludge dewatering, sewage effluent irrigation of agricultural land and recreational facilities (golf courses, parks) and treated effluent re-use for recreational, domestic, and industrial purposes.<br><br>Our services include surface and groundwater source development and water quality monitoring and evaluation. The groundwater development includes aquifer investigation and testing, wells installation, aquifer performance monitoring and aquifer contamination evaluation and remediation.<br><br>The environmental studies we perform include evaluation of impact of solid and liquid wastes on soils and surface and groundwater and surrounding developments.<br><br>The systems which we design include custom designed built-in place plants and shop-fabricated (packaged) smaller plants.<br><br>The custom design, built-in place plants include predominantly earth and cast-in-place concrete structures.<br><br>The shop fabricated systems which we design, fabricate and supply include steel, aluminium and pre-cast concrete plant components and complete plants including pumping stations, filter systems, clarifiers, aeration systems, chemical feed systems and complete treatment processes.<br><br>We also design and fabricate water level, flow and quality On-Site and Remote Monitoring  Systems for process control and environmental applications.<br><br>We have been conducting research and development of new technologies for water and wastewater treatment with aim of reducing the residual waste and re-use of treated wastewater for land irrigation, recreational and industrial processes and domestic re-use for sanitary purposes and ground watering.<br><br>Our research and development conducted under the Canadian Scientific Research and Experimental Development Program led to development of several novel water and wastewater treatment technologies as follows:<br><br>	Air Aspirator-Mixer for aeration of water and wastewater and oxidation processes with Ozone and Ozone/H2O2. <br>	Versatile Biological Wastewater Treatment System. <br>	Aeration System for Wastewater Lagoons. <br>	Super Oxidation System for Water &amp; Wastewater Treatment. <br>	Produced Water (Oily Water) Treatment System. <br>	Super Clarifier for Water Treatment.<br><br>

* remotely programmable data retrieval and alarms notification<br>
* on-line Personal Computer Base Station software<br>
* mini-SCADA capabilities<br>
* direct interface to a variety of application transducers<br>
<br>
The multipurpose Industrial Telemetry System (ITS) was specifically designed for monitoring of industrial sites, especially during a critical alarm scenarios. Easy interfacing with a wide variety of transducers allows to create a sophisticated telemetry <br>
network. An on-line Personal Computer Base Station makes this fully automated system reliable and portable, while built-in telecommunication interface triggers an alarm directly to your cell phone. A low power, battery operated ITS makes it attractive for monitoring multiple remote sites with instantaneous feedback to an on-line Personal Computer Base Station. Custom software created a mini-SCADA system for historical data collection and charts plotting. <br>
<br>
Each instrument is factory calibrated to the applications specified at the time of order. A compact, fully automated design allows you to monitor multiple installations simultaneously when using a Personal Computer Base Station. <br>
<br>
No moving parts and rugged housing ensures dependable, long service. Transducers and sensors are field replaceable and easy to remove, clean and reinstall for maintenance.<br>

power heater is used to produce a temperature differential between two resistance temperature detectors (RTD&#39;s). The RTD temperature differential varies as a function of forced convection for flow measurement. The measurement of the temperature is from the non-heated RTD. Heater power is field selectable for specific fluid or gas service requirements.<br>
<br>
The instrument is factory calibrated to the applications as specified at the time of order. All alarm set points are programmable and send directly to your cell phone via built-in modem. A compact, fully automated design allows you to monitor multiple installations simultaneously when using a Personal Computer Base Station.<br>
<br>
The unique built-in alarm capability ensures that you are immediately notified about the flow or temperature problems.<br>
<br>
No moving parts and rugged housing ensures dependable, long service. The RTD sensor is easy to remove, clean and reinstall for maintenance.<br>

The Industrial Telemetry System (ITS) was designed for detecting a presence of fuel spill on water. ITS-OIL/WATER combines proven electro-optical and conductive technologies together to deliver advanced capabilities in the early warning of hydrocarbons presence on water surface. A slim, compact design allows easy installation into narrow areas of water wells, water reservoirs, double wall pipes and tanks. A special floating buoy assembly ensures collection of data from the water surface only, and makes it easy to monitor water wells contamination. Simultaneously, the conductivity probes determine if the liquid is conductive (water-only) or non-conductivity (hydrocarbon-based). Sensing the change, the ITS system triggers an alarm directly to your pager.<br>
<br>
This unique built-in alarm capability ensures that you are immediately notified about the oil spill. Early warning allows you to prevent an environmental disaster at the very early <br>
stages.<br>

Water Well Wizard (WWW) was specifically designed to simplify the collection of water well pumping test data. The device is rugged, durable and fully automated to minimize the need for manual data gathering over long term. To obtain accurate changes in water level, there is a built-in compensation for atmospheric pressure changes.<br>
<br>
Information is recorded in a timetable format meeting Government Agencies&#39; requirements. All parameters are already preset to function as soon as the probe is submersed into the well.<br>
<br>
Installation consists of placing a WWW unit in a pumping and / or observation well, lowering the probe into the well and starting the pumping cycle. WWW uses its own batteries to operate, and once set, will start working immediately, 24-hours per day, until the end of testing. It senses and automatically files time periods, water levels during each pumping and recovery cycles, as well as the power generator status. When finished testing the well, you are immediately ready to prepare a water well pumping test report from the accumulated data.<br>
<br>
Based on the data collected from the well site, the WWW unit prepares the water well&#39;s performance results. To retrieve this information, you bring up the menu using a single toggle switch on the hand-held display unit. No need for programming - we did it for you!<br>

                            A versatile and efficient biological wastewater treatment system is provided which is adaptable to small, shop fabricated package plants and large, assembled in place plants, and which can be operated as a secondary treatment, activated sludge process, for suspended solids and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) removal, or a tertiary treatment, activated sludge process, for suspended solids, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Nitrogen and Phosphorous removal. The system major equipment includes a wastewater pump and an air aspirator-mixer to provide aeration, sludge recirculation and waste, and wastewater recirculation for the secondary and tertiary treatment processes. The aeration system with the air aspirator-mixer is highly efficient in oxygen transfer to the wastewater, easy to maintain and versatile to use, as it is located outside aeration tanks.  The wastewater pump and air aspirator-mixer system lends itself to continuous and cyclic aeration and oxic and anoxic treatment processes. The multiple use of the wastewater pump for aeration, recirculation and sludge waste minimizes the number of pumping systems required and eliminates air blowers.<br>

<br>
The multipurpose Industrial Telemetry System (ITS) was designed for fixed position monitoring of signal-point flow, level, and temperature of fluid and gas media. The operation of sensing element is based upon the thermal dispersion principle. A low <br>
power heater is used to produce a temperature differential between two resistance temperature detectors (RTD&#39;s). The RTD temperature differential varies as a function of forced convection for flow measurement. The measurement of the temperature is from the non-heated RTD. Heater power is field selectable for specific fluid or gas service requirements.<br>
<br>
The instrument is factory calibrated to the applications as specified at the time of order. All alarm set points are programmable and send directly to your cell phone via built-in modem. A compact, fully automated design allows you to monitor multiple installations simultaneously when using a Personal Computer Base Station.<br>
<br>
The unique built-in alarm capability ensures that you are immediately notified about the flow or temperature problems.<br>
<br>
No moving parts and rugged housing ensures dependable, long service. The RTD sensor is easy to remove, clean and reinstall for maintenance.<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS<br>
<br>
* continuous liquid or gas flow monitoring<br>
* detecting increasing/decreasing flow rate<br>
* alarming flow/no-flow, we/dry conditions<br>

The Industrial Telemetry System (ITS) was designed for detecting a presence of fuel spill on water. ITS-OIL/WATER combines proven electro-optical and conductive technologies together to deliver advanced capabilities in the early warning of hydrocarbons presence on water surface. A slim, compact design allows easy installation into narrow areas of water wells, water reservoirs, double wall pipes and tanks. A special floating buoy assembly ensures collection of data from the water surface only, and makes it easy to monitor water wells contamination. Simultaneously, the conductivity probes determine if the liquid is conductive (water-only) or non-conductivity (hydrocarbon-based). Sensing the change, the ITS system triggers an alarm directly to your pager.<br>
<br>
This unique built-in alarm capability ensures that you are immediately notified about the oil spill. Early warning allows you to prevent an environmental disaster at the very early <br>
stages.<br>

Water Well Wizard (WWW) was specifically designed to simplify the collection of water well pumping test data. The device is rugged, durable and fully automated to minimize the need for manual data gathering over long term. To obtain accurate changes in water level, there is a built-in compensation for atmospheric pressure changes.<br>
<br>
Information is recorded in a timetable format meeting Government Agencies&#39; requirements. All parameters are already preset to function as soon as the probe is submersed into the well.<br>
<br>
Installation consists of placing a WWW unit in a pumping and / or observation well, lowering the probe into the well and starting the pumping cycle. WWW uses its own batteries to operate, and once set, will start working immediately, 24-hours per day, until the end of testing. It senses and automatically files time periods, water levels during each pumping and recovery cycles, as well as the power generator status. When finished testing the well, you are immediately ready to prepare a water well pumping test report from the accumulated data.<br>
<br>
Based on the data collected from the well site, the WWW unit prepares the water well&#39;s performance results. To retrieve this information, you bring up the menu using a single toggle switch on the hand-held display unit. No need for programming - we did it for you!<br>

                            A versatile and efficient biological wastewater treatment system is provided which is adaptable to small, shop fabricated package plants and large, assembled in place plants, and which can be operated as a secondary treatment, activated sludge process, for suspended solids and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) removal, or a tertiary treatment, activated sludge process, for suspended solids, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Nitrogen and Phosphorous removal. The system major equipment includes a wastewater pump and an air aspirator-mixer to provide aeration, sludge recirculation and waste, and wastewater recirculation for the secondary and tertiary treatment processes. The aeration system with the air aspirator-mixer is highly efficient in oxygen transfer to the wastewater, easy to maintain and versatile to use, as it is located outside aeration tanks.  The wastewater pump and air aspirator-mixer system lends itself to continuous and cyclic aeration and oxic and anoxic treatment processes. The multiple use of the wastewater pump for aeration, recirculation and sludge waste minimizes the number of pumping systems required and eliminates air blowers.<br>
