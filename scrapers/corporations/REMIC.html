        <br>            The Real Estate and Mortgage Institute of Canada Inc. (REMIC) provides the Ontario mortgage agent course for licensing, often referred to as the Ontario mortgage agent licensing course.  This course is required by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) to become a licensed mortgage agent or become a licensed mortgage broker in Ontario.<br><br>If you wish to begin a career as a mortgage agent or a career as a mortgage broker, the REMIC Mortgage Agent Course (RMAC) is what you need to begin.  The REMIC Mortgage Agent Course meets the FSCO requirements for mortgage agent education as detailed in the Mortgage Agent Qualifying Standards (MAQS) as published by FSCO.<br><br>A career as a mortgage agent or a career as a mortgage broker can be both personally and financially rewarding.  REMIC, founded by Joseph White, considered by many to be the industrys foremost educator and author provides the REMIC Ontario Mortgage Agent Course both online and in class.  To view details about the REMIC Ontario Mortgage Agent Course online, click here.  To view details about the REMIC Mortgage Agent Course in class, click here.<br><br>Many who choose a career as a real estate agent or a career in real estate will also choose to take the REMIC Ontario Mortgage Agent Course to either add to their knowledge, or become a licensed mortgage agent or a licensed mortgage broker to offer that additional service to their buyers.<br><br>Once the REMIC Mortgage Agent Course has been successfully completed an individual must be hired by a licensed Ontario Mortgage Brokerage.  The brokerage will then apply to the Financial Services Commission of Ontario on behalf of the student for his or her mortgage agent license.<br>

                            REMIC Mortgage Agent Course for Licensing (RMAC)<br>
<br>
The first step in becoming a licensed mortgage agent begins with taking and completing the REMIC mortgage agent course for licensing (RMAC). This course is required by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) to become a licensed mortgage agent or mortgage broker in Ontario.<br>
<br>
Course Summary:<br>
Course Length: 47 hours<br>
Course Delivery: online or in class<br>
Final Examination: 3 hours (must be written in class)<br>
Enrolment Period: one week up to 6 months<br>
<br>
In Class Course Format - $345<br>
<br>
We offer several different types of in-class courses designed to meet the varying needs of our students who prefer the in-class experience. The material is the same as in the online course, however in class you also have the benefit of the live experience. Another main difference between the online and the in-class course is the time allotted to complete the course. The online course can be completed in up to 6 months, while the in class course is completed in its format. So a five day course is completed in those five days, while 5 Sundays are completed in that time frame. However, if you don&#39;t feel that you are prepared to write the exam at the end of the in class course (perhaps you could not devote the time necessary during the course) you can defer the exam at no cost. It&#39;s as simple as requesting that from your instructor.<br>
<br>
5 Days Monday to Friday<br>
<br>
    perfect for you if you want &quot;face time&quot; with your instructor and want to complete the course quickly<br>
<br>
    each day lasts from 10 am to 4 pm<br>
<br>
    students are expected to complete online tasks after class, although this is not mandatory<br>

    this &quot;mixed mode&quot; course is perfect for you if you want &quot;face time&quot; with your instructor but you can&#39;t commit full days to the course<br>
<br>
    the course consists of two Saturdays in class from 10 am to 4 pm, with 6 days of online work in between<br>
<br>
    the exam is written on the second Saturday<br>
<br>
5 Sundays<br>
<br>
    perfect if you want &quot;face time&quot; with your instructor but can&#39;t commit full days to the course because you work or have other obligations<br>

First, we offer the REMIC Mortgage Agent Course (RMAC) online.

The online course offers you the flexibility to complete it in as little as one week or take up to six months. This means that it has the flexibility to meet even the most demanding schedules. Designed for ease of use, our online course combines video tutorials, interactive assignments, a very user-friendly textbook and the ability to communicate with your dedicated instructor online when you need the help.<br>
<br>
<br>

                            REMIC Mortgage Agent Course for Licensing (RMAC)<br>
<br>
The first step in becoming a licensed mortgage agent begins with taking and completing the REMIC mortgage agent course for licensing (RMAC). This course is required by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) to become a licensed mortgage agent or mortgage broker in Ontario.<br>
<br>
Course Summary:<br>
Course Length: 47 hours<br>
Course Delivery: online or in class<br>
Final Examination: 3 hours (must be written in class)<br>
Enrolment Period: one week up to 6 months<br>
<br>
In Class Course Format - $345<br>
<br>
We offer several different types of in-class courses designed to meet the varying needs of our students who prefer the in-class experience. The material is the same as in the online course, however in class you also have the benefit of the live experience. Another main difference between the online and the in-class course is the time allotted to complete the course. The online course can be completed in up to 6 months, while the in class course is completed in its format. So a five day course is completed in those five days, while 5 Sundays are completed in that time frame. However, if you don&#39;t feel that you are prepared to write the exam at the end of the in class course (perhaps you could not devote the time necessary during the course) you can defer the exam at no cost. It&#39;s as simple as requesting that from your instructor.<br>
<br>

<br>
    perfect for you if you want &quot;face time&quot; with your instructor and want to complete the course quickly<br>

Designed for ease of use, our online course combines video tutorials, interactive assignments, a very user-friendly textbook and the ability to communicate with your dedicated instructor online when you need the help.<br>
