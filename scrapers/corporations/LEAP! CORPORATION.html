              What We Did For General Dynamics Canada<br>
 <br>
General Dynamics Canada engaged Leap! Corporation to develop a program that would result in leaders with more self awareness, more knowledge of how to lead performers of different preferences and outlooks, and the ability and confidence to step up to tackle critical business opportunities and problems.  The program sought to create a community of leaders who would trust and rely upon each other across organizational boundaries.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We started by exploring, with groups of existing leaders in the company, the core competencies needed to lead within General Dynamics Canada. We created a leadership framework for the company and designed a 360º feedback tool based on that framework. The results of the 360 º tool and a behavioural tool, called DiSC, launched each individual on his and her personal leadership journey, supported by professional coaches who we provided.<br>
<br>
 <br>
We designed three, three-day learning sessions that engaged participants in conversations that explored what leadership meant for each participant,  what it meant to be a leader responsible for leading the performance of others, and what it meant to lead change within an organization. Through the last two elements of the course, teams of participants tackled issues of concern to the Executive Committee of the company and engaged with them to seek support for a way forward on those matters. The program offered a diverse learning experience that included individual reflection, conversation, research, instruction, and peer and professional coaching.<br>
<br>
We only develop custom learning programs that are tailored to the requirements and cultures of our clients. Our programs are rooted in the experience of our clients. We prefer to work deeply with a few clients rather than on the surface with many, and we remain committed to them long after our formal engagements with them end. We believe we are successful when our clients no longer need us.<br>
<br>
Our engagement with General Dynamics Canada has lasted several years. Approximately 300 leaders from three corporate locations have participated in the program. <br>
 <br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Alan Sobel has provided wise counsel to me and my executive group at General Dynamics Canada since 2001. He was a partner in the design and delivery of our Leadership Development Program, which helped to propel the firm into the ranks of Canadas top 100 employers; and he has contributed strategic business, human resources and organizational development insight as a trusted consultant. We value having him with us. <br>
<br>
 John Watts, President, General Dynamics Canada, December 2007<br>
<br>
I have worked with Alan Sobel now for over four years in several different contexts. He has facilitated many sessions in which I was a participant, he has designed and delivered learning programs for my organization, and he has worked with me as a personal executive coach. However, the greatest value I have derived from my long term relationship with Alan comes from my work with him as a non-partisan adviser and counsellor in strategic planning and organizational alignment. Alan and I have worked together to design and implement strategic planning initiatives built around developing approaches that achieve organizational goals, but also provide significant personal and group development opportunities in the process of doing so. My work with Alan has been much more about developing a relationship with a trusted and respected counsel who can add long term value to my company through increasing intimacy with our way of being, than a mere peer to peer relationship with a consultant.<br>
<br>
  David Ibbetson, Vice President, May 2006<br>
<br>
Mr. Sobel served as lead facilitator of a food safety initiative between our industry and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  Mr. Sobel&#39;s coordination and structure of our working schedule was only eclipsed by his ability to bring out the best of our group skills, and by his ability to translate the tangible findings that are sometimes so difficult to extract.  I would credit our success and be so bold to state that we unanimously felt the project would have taken more of the teams resources without Mr. Sobel, if we would have been able to complete the project at all.<br>
<br>
- Adam Koven, President, Canadian Association of Ice Industries, October, 2007<br>
<br>
<br>
As the chair of a diverse group of players, including international pharmaceutical companies, Canadian farm producers, feed manufacturers and federal government inspection and enforcement agencies, I have worked closely with Alan Sobel as we jointly sought to achieve consensus on a series of long standing disputes.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Alan facilitated a number of multi-stakeholder sessions.  He also mediated many internal sectoral differences which had completely stalled efforts to focus on common interests shared by all players.  His success in these latter endeavours was largely responsible for our overall success in bringing about a positive working relationship among the various players.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Alans skills are based on his sincerity, his warm personality and his ability to put himself in the other partys shoes, as it were.  He brings out the best in people after he draws out their frustrations with his understanding approach to their feelings.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have dealt directly with the public for all off my working life.  I began as a rural veterinary practitioner, held elected office in all three levels of government - municipal, provincial and federal - for over twenty years, and finally, in upper management and policy with the federal government.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have been embroiled in many disputes from those involving two individuals to those involving province wide strikes in my days as a provincial minister of the Crown. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have made use of mediators and I believe strongly in mediation.  I can say with sincerity I wish I had met Alan Sobel years ago.  He is tops.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Yours truly<br>
<br>

              What We Did For General Dynamics Canada<br>
 <br>
General Dynamics Canada engaged Leap! Corporation to develop a program that would result in leaders with more self awareness, more knowledge of how to lead performers of different preferences and outlooks, and the ability and confidence to step up to tackle critical business opportunities and problems.  The program sought to create a community of leaders who would trust and rely upon each other across organizational boundaries.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We started by exploring, with groups of existing leaders in the company, the core competencies needed to lead within General Dynamics Canada. We created a leadership framework for the company and designed a 360º feedback tool based on that framework. The results of the 360 º tool and a behavioural tool, called DiSC, launched each individual on his and her personal leadership journey, supported by professional coaches who we provided.<br>
<br>
 <br>
We designed three, three-day learning sessions that engaged participants in conversations that explored what leadership meant for each participant,  what it meant to be a leader responsible for leading the performance of others, and what it meant to lead change within an organization. Through the last two elements of the course, teams of participants tackled issues of concern to the Executive Committee of the company and engaged with them to seek support for a way forward on those matters. The program offered a diverse learning experience that included individual reflection, conversation, research, instruction, and peer and professional coaching.<br>
<br>
We only develop custom learning programs that are tailored to the requirements and cultures of our clients. Our programs are rooted in the experience of our clients. We prefer to work deeply with a few clients rather than on the surface with many, and we remain committed to them long after our formal engagements with them end. We believe we are successful when our clients no longer need us.<br>
<br>
Our engagement with General Dynamics Canada has lasted several years. Approximately 300 leaders from three corporate locations have participated in the program. <br>
 <br>

           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Alan Sobel has provided wise counsel to me and my executive group at General Dynamics Canada since 2001. He was a partner in the design and delivery of our Leadership Development Program, which helped to propel the firm into the ranks of Canadas top 100 employers; and he has contributed strategic business, human resources and organizational development insight as a trusted consultant. We value having him with us. <br>
<br>
 John Watts, President, General Dynamics Canada, December 2007<br>
<br>
I have worked with Alan Sobel now for over four years in several different contexts. He has facilitated many sessions in which I was a participant, he has designed and delivered learning programs for my organization, and he has worked with me as a personal executive coach. However, the greatest value I have derived from my long term relationship with Alan comes from my work with him as a non-partisan adviser and counsellor in strategic planning and organizational alignment. Alan and I have worked together to design and implement strategic planning initiatives built around developing approaches that achieve organizational goals, but also provide significant personal and group development opportunities in the process of doing so. My work with Alan has been much more about developing a relationship with a trusted and respected counsel who can add long term value to my company through increasing intimacy with our way of being, than a mere peer to peer relationship with a consultant.<br>
<br>
  David Ibbetson, Vice President, May 2006<br>
<br>
Mr. Sobel served as lead facilitator of a food safety initiative between our industry and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  Mr. Sobel&#39;s coordination and structure of our working schedule was only eclipsed by his ability to bring out the best of our group skills, and by his ability to translate the tangible findings that are sometimes so difficult to extract.  I would credit our success and be so bold to state that we unanimously felt the project would have taken more of the teams resources without Mr. Sobel, if we would have been able to complete the project at all.<br>
<br>
- Adam Koven, President, Canadian Association of Ice Industries, October, 2007<br>
<br>
<br>
As the chair of a diverse group of players, including international pharmaceutical companies, Canadian farm producers, feed manufacturers and federal government inspection and enforcement agencies, I have worked closely with Alan Sobel as we jointly sought to achieve consensus on a series of long standing disputes.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Alan facilitated a number of multi-stakeholder sessions.  He also mediated many internal sectoral differences which had completely stalled efforts to focus on common interests shared by all players.  His success in these latter endeavours was largely responsible for our overall success in bringing about a positive working relationship among the various players.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Alans skills are based on his sincerity, his warm personality and his ability to put himself in the other partys shoes, as it were.  He brings out the best in people after he draws out their frustrations with his understanding approach to their feelings.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have dealt directly with the public for all off my working life.  I began as a rural veterinary practitioner, held elected office in all three levels of government - municipal, provincial and federal - for over twenty years, and finally, in upper management and policy with the federal government.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have been embroiled in many disputes from those involving two individuals to those involving province wide strikes in my days as a provincial minister of the Crown. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have made use of mediators and I believe strongly in mediation.  I can say with sincerity I wish I had met Alan Sobel years ago.  He is tops.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Yours truly<br>
<br>
