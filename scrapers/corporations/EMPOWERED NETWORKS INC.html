                            As a leader in automated breach defense, Damballa delivers advanced threat protection and containment for active threats that bypass all security prevention layers. Damballa rapidly discovers infections with certainty, pinpointing the compromised devices that represent the highest risk to a business, and enabling prioritized response and refocusing of security experts to the areas of greatest risk to an enterprise.<br>
<br>
Empowered can rapidly deploy a Failsafe appliance – in less than an hour, with minimal configuration – to contain and respond to a breach in progress, to verify what your existing security tools don’t catch, or as a proof-of-concept demonstration.  Each appliance is completely sanitized before implementation, and before removal from secure environments. Our unique skills and real world experience in network and security monitoring, forensics and loss prevention are always available to assist with system design, deployment and ongoing analysis, to help our customers get the full value of their investments in Damballa&#39;s advanced solutions.<br>

                            EmpoweredDeploy Services  are focused engagements where Empowered&#39;s team deploys a solution into your environment, using our E4 Methodology. The Enhance step of E4 maps out a detailed action plan, in a formal Statement of Work. The SOW defines exactly what we will deliver and when, our processes for managing the project, and how we will demonstrate success - to your complete satisfaction. EmpoweredDeploy is how Empowered&#39;s team will Execute that action plan. <br>
<br>
Here&#39;s details of an EmpoweredDeploy engagement: <br>
<br>
Project Management<br>
Our disciplined approach to project management includes effective, regular reports on progress and issues so that decisions are informed and success is ensured. Our process is simple, transparent and optimized. Empowered&#39;s project manager will track and analyze project status and issues, and provide a regular status report to interested parties as required. Where required, Empowered&#39;s project manager will administer our formal Change Request process. <br>
<br>
Documentation<br>
To complement Vendor supplied manuals provided, Empowered will document the customizations and configurations created as part of EmpoweredDeploy, to provide a record of our work, and a starting point for solid on-going configuration control. Documentation will range from simple commented scripts to detailed procedures documents on how to effectively maintain and utilize the solution. After a formal review process, All documentation will be delivered upon project completion, and become the property of the customer. <br>
<br>
Knowledge Transfer<br>
EmpoweredDeploy includes knowledge transfer training. This typically consists of Empowered&#39;s team working with the system administrators responsible for ongoing maintenance of the solution, and working from sample rules, integrations and automations to create customized versions. Empowered prefers to actively involve system administrators in the project, to maximize opportunity for knowledge transfer. <br>
<br>
Acceptance Testing<br>
Formal Acceptance Tests are defined in the Statement of Work, and will be performed jointly by Empowered and the Project Manager to formally validate that we have delivered everything we were engaged to deliver, to the satisfaction of our customer.<br>
<br>
With completion of the project, the final step in E4, Endorse, begins. We will conduct a debriefing session to review all deliverables, respond to questions, and solicit feedback on the quality of our work and our performance against defined metrics for success. <br>
E4 Methodology is our means to ensure we make productive use of your time and attention, to meet and exceed your expectations, and to deliver concrete business value throughout the lifecycle of your investment in our solutions. <br>

                            As a leader in automated breach defense, Damballa delivers advanced threat protection and containment for active threats that bypass all security prevention layers. Damballa rapidly discovers infections with certainty, pinpointing the compromised devices that represent the highest risk to a business, and enabling prioritized response and refocusing of security experts to the areas of greatest risk to an enterprise.<br>
<br>
Empowered can rapidly deploy a Failsafe appliance – in less than an hour, with minimal configuration – to contain and respond to a breach in progress, to verify what your existing security tools don’t catch, or as a proof-of-concept demonstration.  Each appliance is completely sanitized before implementation, and before removal from secure environments. Our unique skills and real world experience in network and security monitoring, forensics and loss prevention are always available to assist with system design, deployment and ongoing analysis, to help our customers get the full value of their investments in Damballa&#39;s advanced solutions.<br>

                            EmpoweredDeploy Services  are focused engagements where Empowered&#39;s team deploys a solution into your environment, using our E4 Methodology. The Enhance step of E4 maps out a detailed action plan, in a formal Statement of Work. The SOW defines exactly what we will deliver and when, our processes for managing the project, and how we will demonstrate success - to your complete satisfaction. EmpoweredDeploy is how Empowered&#39;s team will Execute that action plan. <br>
<br>
Here&#39;s details of an EmpoweredDeploy engagement: <br>
<br>
Project Management<br>
Our disciplined approach to project management includes effective, regular reports on progress and issues so that decisions are informed and success is ensured. Our process is simple, transparent and optimized. Empowered&#39;s project manager will track and analyze project status and issues, and provide a regular status report to interested parties as required. Where required, Empowered&#39;s project manager will administer our formal Change Request process. <br>
<br>
Documentation<br>
To complement Vendor supplied manuals provided, Empowered will document the customizations and configurations created as part of EmpoweredDeploy, to provide a record of our work, and a starting point for solid on-going configuration control. Documentation will range from simple commented scripts to detailed procedures documents on how to effectively maintain and utilize the solution. After a formal review process, All documentation will be delivered upon project completion, and become the property of the customer. <br>
<br>
Knowledge Transfer<br>
EmpoweredDeploy includes knowledge transfer training. This typically consists of Empowered&#39;s team working with the system administrators responsible for ongoing maintenance of the solution, and working from sample rules, integrations and automations to create customized versions. Empowered prefers to actively involve system administrators in the project, to maximize opportunity for knowledge transfer. <br>
<br>
Acceptance Testing<br>
Formal Acceptance Tests are defined in the Statement of Work, and will be performed jointly by Empowered and the Project Manager to formally validate that we have delivered everything we were engaged to deliver, to the satisfaction of our customer.<br>
<br>
With completion of the project, the final step in E4, Endorse, begins. We will conduct a debriefing session to review all deliverables, respond to questions, and solicit feedback on the quality of our work and our performance against defined metrics for success. <br>
E4 Methodology is our means to ensure we make productive use of your time and attention, to meet and exceed your expectations, and to deliver concrete business value throughout the lifecycle of your investment in our solutions. <br>
