      <br>
       A&amp;L Computer Software Limited has been in the computer software business since 1982. With the release of the A&amp;L Medical System in 1985, A&amp;L started directing its product line toward the medical market in Ontario, more specifically to medical offices and clinics. A&amp;L has worked closely with the Ontario Medical Association, medical laboratories and the Ontario Ministry of Health to ensure that its software applications align well to the specific needs of its clients. A&amp;L's president, Alex Yuan was granted the 1995 Entrepreneur Of The Year award from the Town of Richmond Hill, Ontario. In 1998 he also received the Entrepreneur Of The Year award from the Association of Chinese Canadian Entrepreneurs and the Outstanding Business Achievement Award from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. In 1994, A&amp;L released its document imaging program, A&amp;L Document Console, expanding its potential client base beyond the medical community (and beyond Ontario) to include a variety of business venues. This software product allows all documents, whether they be text, photographs, charts, etc., to be stored and indexed on computer databases for immediate access. This can allow a business to run a virtually paperless office and to electronically route all documents anywhere in the world.  Please make sure to visit often to keep up with our latest developments.
       <br>
        <br>
         A&amp;L has achieved a high level of success in its position as a leader in the development of medical software, a position on which A&amp;L continues to build. A&amp;L will continue to provide timely and cost effective leading edge solutions, not only to the medical community, but to the business community as a whole. Through the on-going development of its document imaging package A&amp;L has expanded its client base, delivering high quality software to the global community. The A&amp;L team is here to serve you in any way we can.

           Document Imaging
           <br>
            <br>
             Why Store Paper When You Can Store Documents Electronically?
             <br>
              <br>
               Document Imaging is the process of converting a hard copy document (text, photograph, drawing, etc.) into computer readable format. This is usually done by a process called scanning, using a machine called a scanner.
               <br>
                <br>
                 Once scanned, the information is then stored on computer disk where it can be accessed later for reading, printing or transmission via fax, proprietary network, e-mail or the Internet to another computer or fax machine anywhere in the world. The many advantages of this process include a reduction in physical storage space (in effect you have a ``virtual filing cabinet``), easier and faster access, a reduction in paper handling and a reduction in operating costs.
                 <br>
                  <br>
                   What is A&amp;L Document Console?
                   <br>
                    <br>
                     A&amp;L Document Console is unique in its approach to document handling. It approaches filing in two ways. First, it helps to collect information from many different sources and converts it into a computerized form as part of your filing system or database. Secondly, it provides you with the facility to carefully organize information so that you can use it readily and selectively from your own desk.
                     <br>
                      <br>
                       A&amp;L Document Console recognizes a multitude of documents, and is able to import from most applications, including faxes. The pleasant surprise is how easy it is to use. As a Windows based and web based program, all of its functions are simply a matter of pointing and clicking a computer mouse using the friendly Graphical User Interface.
                       <br>
                        <br>
                         A&amp;L Document Console also dramatically improves security procedures by restricting access to confidential information by means of password-protected processes, which have various levels of security. This protects record details from unauthorized access and accidental disclosure. In addition, by preventing files from becoming lost or misplaced, the security of all your records and documents is further tightened.
                         <br>
                          <br>
                           A&amp;L Document Console has multi-user environment capabilities as well as different compression modes, JPEG, TIFF and GIF. Input can be generated from disk files, clipboard files, scanners and/or any digital input conforming to TWAIN Standards.
                           <br>
                            <br>
                             A&amp;L Document Console is an information integrator and file manager. It will help you keep abreast of filing and re-filing procedures while being able to handle virtually an unlimited number of documents daily. Any document or file can now be in your computer, stored and indexed on a database, waiting to be used. It can help any doctor, lawyer, accountant, banker or any other business office environment improve its document handling procedures. Our new web-based solution ensures that you can move forward and store files electronically and is easily deploy our application across multiple sites and locations, leveraging technology used inside A&amp;L Document Console.

                             <br>
                              <br>
                               A&amp;L Document Console currently is able to hold approximately 39,000 images in 600meg. Standard features also include User Access Control, Versioning, System Auditing &amp; Security, Digital Signatures, Data Encryption, Document Locking, DICOM capabilities, Task Management or so much more.  Both versions have been designed with a user interface suited to the medical office or clinic, but can be easily adaptable to other office environments (including Legal, Manufacturing, Government or Financial institutions). Future versions will also be released with user interfaces designed for other specific business environments. For further information, e-mail us at solution@anl.com.

        Our Paperless Office
        <br>
         By Rose Kung, M.D., FRCSC
         <br>
          <br>
           For more than three years we have enjoyed the luxury of having an office with no filing cabinets bulging with patient charts, files and documents. Yet we still have all patient information at our fingertips  or more accurately, at just a few clicks of our computer mouse.
           <br>
            <br>
             Thanks to A&amp;L Computer Software Limiteds program, Document Console, we are able to keep all of our patient information files stored safely and securely in an electronic database on our office personal computer.
             <br>
              <br>
               I operate a busy ob/gyn practice at Womens College Hospital in Toronto. As my practice grew, the storage and retrieval of patient charts along with all the associated examination documents became a burdensome task, not to mention the cost of filing cabinets, file folders and my assistants time taken to access and file the relevant material for each patients visit.
               <br>
                <br>
                 Also, it was not uncommon for an occasional document to be misplaced or misfiled, resulting in additional time being needed to locate the missing material.
                 <br>
                  <br>
                   Since we were already using computers in the office to handle such administrative tasks as our billing procedures I began to consider whether a computer could also be used to speed up the process of storing, accessing and archiving all data in our patient files. When discussing this with our software vendor, A&amp;L Computer Software Limited, they informed me that they had recently finished developing a document imaging program which would allow us to scan into our computer all of our hard copy documents, charts and even photographs. Once scanned, they could be accessed at any time for review, addition of further documentation or even printing, should another hard copy ever be required. Thus, we were introduced to A&amp;Ls Document Console.
                   <br>
                    <br>
                     However, if we were to make any changes to our procedures it was necessary to ensure that there would be no adverse effects on the quality of patient care we provide, and that there would also be an improvement in the operational efficiency of our office. On looking back at our decision to implement the new software I realize we had no guarantees that either of the above criteria would be satisfied. We had, however, achieved both of these objectives upon adopting A&amp;Ls medical billing system several years before, and it was because of this experience that we decided to go ahead with the implementation of their new document imaging software.
                     <br>
                      <br>
                       It has since proven to be a good decision. Our office efficiency has improved and there have been no adverse effects on patient care. In addition, I am happy to say that a further important benefit has been an improvement financially. For the number of patients I service, I would need two large filing cabinets to store their charts and documents in the traditional manner. With the document imaging system I have no need for filing cabinets. I also save costly floor space. Likewise, there are no hanging files or file folders to purchase. The cost saving thus realized paid for the A&amp;L Document Console software.
                       <br>

                           <br>
                            <br>
                             My assistant has conservatively estimated that it used to take an average of from two to three minutes to locate, retrieve and refile each patients file for every appointment using the old manual method. Bringing the information up on the computer takes just seconds. Instead of having to store hard copy documents, with the document imaging software they can easily be scanned into our database and later destroyed. With the new system this process takes my assistant about one hour each week thus freeing up more of her time to attend to other administrative duties.

                              <br>
                               I can understand a physicians reluctance to destroy hard copy patient documents. I also experienced this trepidation. But over a period of time, the reliability of the system convinced me that it was no longer necessary to save them. After all, this would defeat the purpose of having the system in the first place. Of course, our database is backed up every day by the hospitals Information Technology department; so if something does happen to our computer system we always have a copy of our files from which the database can be easily recreated. Now our hard copy documents are regularly sent for shredding every two weeks or so.
                               <br>
                                <br>
                                 For new patients visiting for the first time it is a simple procedure for my assistant to create a new chart record. Once established, any documents pertaining to that patient can be scanned into the computer and attached to their chart. For my daily appointments there is no need for my assistant to pull any of the patients files and stack them on my desk. During the consultation I simply pull up their file on my computer, giving me instant access to all the information from previous appointments.
                                 <br>
                                  <br>
                                   With the latest version of Document Console, any notes I make during the consultation can be keyed into the patients file immediately. Likewise, any letters written to or about the patient using a word processing package can be imported electronically by Document Console and attached to the patients file.
                                   <br>
                                    <br>
                                     As test results come back to the office they, too, can be scanned into the appropriate patients file. They are thus accessible for my reference, or for my assistant to access whenever the patient calls in for them or for any other information concerning their treatment. My nurse also has convenient access to patient information at any time, as do the hospital residents.
                                     <br>
                                      <br>
                                       A further benefit the system provides is the capability to access patient profiles from home. It is therefore possible to work from home without having to take patient charts and documents away from the office. This avoids the risk of losing or misplacing patient information, or accidentally leaving a chart at home (or even worse, at the cottage), a situation that I am sure many physicians have experienced at one time or another.

                                               <br>
                                                Another benefit of remote access is the ability to respond to patient queries when we are away from the office. We can call forward the phone to, for example, my assistants home. From there she is able to access patient files on our office computer using a laptop with a modem. Remote access is really a timesaving convenience for us and for our patients.
                                                <br>
                                                 <br>
                                                  Security of patient information is not an issue since password protection is provided by the system. Also, different types of access capabilities can be assigned to staff at the time their passwords are established.
                                                  <br>
                                                   <br>
                                                    Another advantage the system provides is the ability to send copies of patient documents to another physician anywhere in the world, directly from my computer, as long as that physician has the capability to receive information electronically. This can be done by fax or by an e-mail attachment and avoids the necessity of having to make a hard copy of a document as well as the expense incurred in mailing it. In the same manner, electronic documents can be received from other sources and easily attached to a patients file in my database.
                                                    <br>
                                                     <br>
                                                      Clinics, specialists who see a patient only once or twice and new physicians can all find ways to benefit in different ways from the features of this system. Clinics will find it easy to establish a standardized charting method that everyone can adhere to, thus making it easier for new doctors and locums to adjust to the characteristics of the system in a particular clinic.
                                                      <br>
                                                       <br>
                                                        Physicians starting up their practice can establish and build their database from scratch in a systematic way that will provide built in efficiencies as their practice grows. Specialists have an efficient method for archiving patient files, and establishing a conveniently accessible database for research use at any time.

                                                         <br>
                                                          All in all we find the convenience and time saved by using this system to be a great advantage to our office operations. It also presents an efficient way to archive inactive patient files, and in my type of practice they are in the majority. After having used this system for over three years now, I would not want to return to the manual method for storing patient charts and files.

           Document Imaging
           <br>
            <br>
             Why Store Paper When You Can Store Documents Electronically?
             <br>
              <br>
               Document Imaging is the process of converting a hard copy document (text, photograph, drawing, etc.) into computer readable format. This is usually done by a process called scanning, using a machine called a scanner.
               <br>
                <br>
                 Once scanned, the information is then stored on computer disk where it can be accessed later for reading, printing or transmission via fax, proprietary network, e-mail or the Internet to another computer or fax machine anywhere in the world. The many advantages of this process include a reduction in physical storage space (in effect you have a ``virtual filing cabinet``), easier and faster access, a reduction in paper handling and a reduction in operating costs.
                 <br>
                  <br>
                   What is A&amp;L Document Console?
                   <br>
                    <br>
                     A&amp;L Document Console is unique in its approach to document handling. It approaches filing in two ways. First, it helps to collect information from many different sources and converts it into a computerized form as part of your filing system or database. Secondly, it provides you with the facility to carefully organize information so that you can use it readily and selectively from your own desk.
                     <br>
                      <br>
                       A&amp;L Document Console recognizes a multitude of documents, and is able to import from most applications, including faxes. The pleasant surprise is how easy it is to use. As a Windows based and web based program, all of its functions are simply a matter of pointing and clicking a computer mouse using the friendly Graphical User Interface.
                       <br>
                        <br>
                         A&amp;L Document Console also dramatically improves security procedures by restricting access to confidential information by means of password-protected processes, which have various levels of security. This protects record details from unauthorized access and accidental disclosure. In addition, by preventing files from becoming lost or misplaced, the security of all your records and documents is further tightened.
                         <br>
                          <br>
                           A&amp;L Document Console has multi-user environment capabilities as well as different compression modes, JPEG, TIFF and GIF. Input can be generated from disk files, clipboard files, scanners and/or any digital input conforming to TWAIN Standards.
                           <br>
                            <br>
                             A&amp;L Document Console is an information integrator and file manager. It will help you keep abreast of filing and re-filing procedures while being able to handle virtually an unlimited number of documents daily. Any document or file can now be in your computer, stored and indexed on a database, waiting to be used. It can help any doctor, lawyer, accountant, banker or any other business office environment improve its document handling procedures.

        Our Paperless Office
        <br>
         By Rose Kung, M.D., FRCSC
         <br>
          <br>
           For more than three years we have enjoyed the luxury of having an office with no filing cabinets bulging with patient charts, files and documents. Yet we still have all patient information at our fingertips  or more accurately, at just a few clicks of our computer mouse.
           <br>
            <br>
             Thanks to A&amp;L Computer Software Limiteds program, Document Console, we are able to keep all of our patient information files stored safely and securely in an electronic database on our office personal computer.
             <br>
              <br>
               I operate a busy ob/gyn practice at Womens College Hospital in Toronto. As my practice grew, the storage and retrieval of patient charts along with all the associated examination documents became a burdensome task, not to mention the cost of filing cabinets, file folders and my assistants time taken to access and file the relevant material for each patients visit.
               <br>
                <br>
                 Also, it was not uncommon for an occasional document to be misplaced or misfiled, resulting in additional time being needed to locate the missing material.
                 <br>
                  <br>
                   Since we were already using computers in the office to handle such administrative tasks as our billing procedures I began to consider whether a computer could also be used to speed up the process of storing, accessing and archiving all data in our patient files. When discussing this with our software vendor, A&amp;L Computer Software Limited, they informed me that they had recently finished developing a document imaging program which would allow us to scan into our computer all of our hard copy documents, charts and even photographs. Once scanned, they could be accessed at any time for review, addition of further documentation or even printing, should another hard copy ever be required. Thus, we were introduced to A&amp;Ls Document Console.
                   <br>
                    <br>
                     However, if we were to make any changes to our procedures it was necessary to ensure that there would be no adverse effects on the quality of patient care we provide, and that there would also be an improvement in the operational efficiency of our office. On looking back at our decision to implement the new software I realize we had no guarantees that either of the above criteria would be satisfied. We had, however, achieved both of these objectives upon adopting A&amp;Ls medical billing system several years before, and it was because of this experience that we decided to go ahead with the implementation of their new document imaging software.
                     <br>
                      <br>
                       It has since proven to be a good decision. Our office efficiency has improved and there have been no adverse effects on patient care. In addition, I am happy to say that a further important benefit has been an improvement financially. For the number of patients I service, I would need two large filing cabinets to store their charts and documents in the traditional manner. With the document imaging system I have no need for filing cabinets. I also save costly floor space. Likewise, there are no hanging files or file folders to purchase. The cost saving thus realized paid for the A&amp;L Document Console software.
                       <br>

                        <br>
                         <br>
                          Page 2
                          <br>
                           <br>
                            <br>
                             My assistant has conservatively estimated that it used to take an average of from two to three minutes to locate, retrieve and refile each patients file for every appointment using the old manual method. Bringing the information up on the computer takes just seconds. Instead of having to store hard copy documents, with the document imaging software they can easily be scanned into our database and later destroyed. With the new system this process takes my assistant about one hour each week thus freeing up more of her time to attend to other administrative duties.
                             <br>
                              <br>
                               I can understand a physicians reluctance to destroy hard copy patient documents. I also experienced this trepidation. But over a period of time, the reliability of the system convinced me that it was no longer necessary to save them. After all, this would defeat the purpose of having the system in the first place. Of course, our database is backed up every day by the hospitals Information Technology department; so if something does happen to our computer system we always have a copy of our files from which the database can be easily recreated. Now our hard copy documents are regularly sent for shredding every two weeks or so.
                               <br>
                                <br>
                                 For new patients visiting for the first time it is a simple procedure for my assistant to create a new chart record. Once established, any documents pertaining to that patient can be scanned into the computer and attached to their chart. For my daily appointments there is no need for my assistant to pull any of the patients files and stack them on my desk. During the consultation I simply pull up their file on my computer, giving me instant access to all the information from previous appointments.
                                 <br>
                                  <br>
                                   With the latest version of Document Console, any notes I make during the consultation can be keyed into the patients file immediately. Likewise, any letters written to or about the patient using a word processing package can be imported electronically by Document Console and attached to the patients file.
                                   <br>
                                    <br>
                                     As test results come back to the office they, too, can be scanned into the appropriate patients file. They are thus accessible for my reference, or for my assistant to access whenever the patient calls in for them or for any other information concerning their treatment. My nurse also has convenient access to patient information at any time, as do the hospital residents.
                                     <br>
                                      <br>
                                       A further benefit the system provides is the capability to access patient profiles from home. It is therefore possible to work from home without having to take patient charts and documents away from the office. This avoids the risk of losing or misplacing patient information, or accidentally leaving a chart at home (or even worse, at the cottage), a situation that I am sure many physicians have experienced at one time or another.

                                               <br>
                                                Another benefit of remote access is the ability to respond to patient queries when we are away from the office. We can call forward the phone to, for example, my assistants home. From there she is able to access patient files on our office computer using a laptop with a modem. Remote access is really a timesaving convenience for us and for our patients.
                                                <br>
                                                 <br>
                                                  Security of patient information is not an issue since password protection is provided by the system. Also, different types of access capabilities can be assigned to staff at the time their passwords are established.
                                                  <br>
                                                   <br>
                                                    Another advantage the system provides is the ability to send copies of patient documents to another physician anywhere in the world, directly from my computer, as long as that physician has the capability to receive information electronically. This can be done by fax or by an e-mail attachment and avoids the necessity of having to make a hard copy of a document as well as the expense incurred in mailing it. In the same manner, electronic documents can be received from other sources and easily attached to a patients file in my database.

                                                     <br>
                                                      Clinics, specialists who see a patient only once or twice and new physicians can all find ways to benefit in different ways from the features of this system. Clinics will find it easy to establish a standardized charting method that everyone can adhere to, thus making it easier for new doctors and locums to adjust to the characteristics of the system in a particular clinic.
                                                      <br>

                                                        Physicians starting up their practice can establish and build their database from scratch in a systematic way that will provide built in efficiencies as their practice grows. Specialists have an efficient method for archiving patient files, and establishing a conveniently accessible database for research use at any time.

                                                         <br>
                                                          All in all we find the convenience and time saved by using this system to be a great advantage to our office operations. It also presents an efficient way to archive inactive patient files, and in my type of practice they are in the majority. After having used this system for over three years now, I would not want to return to the manual method for storing patient charts and files.
