              &quot;An ankle injury can make playing hockey pretty tough, especially in the pro ranks. Although my injury wasn&#39;t enough to keep me out of the line up, I still needed something that would make my skates more comfortable and at the same time protect me from further injury. It was at this time that I got my hands on API and I&#39;ve been using these great inserts ever since.&quot; <br>

&quot;I&#39;m always working on improving my game: finding the right hockey stick and curve for my shot, staying late after practices, etc. So when I saw API for the first time I had to try them. To my surprise I found that they really work and because I put some importance on how I look, I like the fact that nobody knows you&#39;re wearing them. Thanks for everything API Hockey!&quot; <br>

&quot;I have always strived to be to best athlete I could possibly be, especially in hockey and golf. As for hockey comfort is important to me and having used API... comfort is what I got. I recommend API to anyone who is in any shape or form serious about his/her game.&quot; <br>

&quot;Got the inserts this week, took them to a local Canadian Tire and found a well fitting pair of 8 ½ CCM Tacks to use them with, after that I went skating on the Rideau canal skateway we have here in Ottawa. Success! _ a very solid feeling while skating, much more comfort around the ankle and particularly liked how much easier it is to get the skates OFF with the inserts, as the laces are not tightened to the extremes I used to go to in order to get enough support. <br>
<br>
Thanks very much.&quot; <br>

&quot;Surprise! Surprise! Who would have known that such a simple piece of equipment would make such a difference. For years, the first thing that I would do after a game is unlace my skates to relieve the pressure and pain. Now, my skates usually stay on atleast until my third trip to the beer cooler.<br>
<br>
I asked my foot doctor why I had pain and why your product worked for me. He explained that I have high arches that fall due to high flexibility in my foot (my foot twists like a rag at 90E... 45E is normal)... causes pain. Also, people who have high arches have a bone which makes a &quot;lump&quot; on the top part of the foot. This area is also where a main artery, which supplies blood the the toe area, is located. When I put on my skates, the pressure applied by the laces to this &quot;lump&quot; is so great that circulation to the toes is affected... numbness always occurs.<br>
<br>
API makes my skate fit better which reduces my foot rotation and also greatly reduces the pressure applied by the laces and therefore, I have no more numbness... at all!<br>
<br>
Simple,...comfortable,...youre a genius! API works!<br>
<br>
Thanks Marco,<br>

&quot;When I first heard of the product, I was a bit sceptical on what Marco told me that it would do. So I decided I had to try it out for myself. When I put them on for the first time, to tell ya the truth, it was very comfortable and the inserts soon took shape in my skates and it felt great. I feel somewhat lighter on my feet and I can feel that my ankles are well supported. Ever since the day I put them on, there hasn&#39;t been a hockey game that I&#39;ve played yet without them. I would recommend them to anyone because you will feel the change in your skating. <br>

&quot;I&#39;m writing a note to say thank you. I&#39;ll admit, I was doubtful that the API was the solution. My 10 year old son, Keenan, always complained about having sore feet after playing hockey. We tried different things; tighten skates, loosen skates, tie the skates higher, tie the skates lower, even different skates, but nothing worked. Since Keenan has the API he only went without them once and for that time only he had sore feet afterwards. We know the API made a difference. He faithfully wears the API and enjoys the game a whole lot more.<br>

&quot;As for the API product, I have used them several times and then skated without them to better compare. I am completely satisfied. Not only does it protect the top of my ankle from lace bite ,but it also helps keep my heel in the socket. As a result I have more skate control which translates into tighter turns ,faster take off as well as cleaner stops. I wish you the best of luck in marketing your great product and look forward to anything else that you may be working on in the future.<br>
<br>
Thanks again Sincerely , Richard&quot;<br>

&quot;To API Hockey, <br>
<br>
After hearing about this new product, I had to find out what all the fuss was about. It didnt take me long to find out the benefits you can get from wearing them. I was impressed by the way they conformed to my ankles and the way I could finally tie my skates as tight as I wanted without worrying about ankle pain and blood flow to my feet. I was especially delighted to know that the API also protected my ankles from surface impact as I found out when I had to block a shot which otherwise would have hurt Im sure! <br>
<br>
I will faithfully wear my API for as long as I play. <br>
<br>
Thanks API Hockey&quot;<br>

&quot;Just wanted to thank you for those API&#39;s! I used them with my inline skates I bought a couple of years ago and that I use during the summer to fool around with on the street with the kids. <br>
<br>
Anyway I usually end up with sore feet and bruised shins every time I wear them. I have a pair of Bauer inline skates made with a REAL skate boot so the tongue is tough and usually digs into my shins really good every time I use them. Well ... I have used them over and over again this summer and all I can say is WOW! What a feeling. No pain! And as a bonus I had much better support because I could tie them up tighter than usual. I could twist and turn like never before and a few times I forgot I was not on the ice - ouch! This product is awesome. I have tried all sorts alternatives through the years but I could never find something that worked as consistent as the API&#39;s. Every time I wear them they work the same. They don&#39;t feel less thick than the previous time. They are always just right. <br>
<br>
Thanks again Marco. Keep up the good work :)&quot;<br>

&quot;Dear API Hockey, <br>
<br>
My son Cory had been going through a difficult time at the start of this hockey season. He had developed blisters at the front and sides of his ankles which made it quite difficult to skate and to enjoy playing. Having heard about this new product I quickly decided to buy a pair for him. Im very happy to say that Cory now skates pain free. When I ask how they feel he replies, They dont feel like anything, its as if theyre not there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks API Hockey&quot; <br>

&quot;I have tried your inserts and what a difference. I am very happy with your product and well worth the money. I really think that you should promote this product more. I wish you the best on this endeavour.&quot;<br>

&quot;Finally got to utilize the API&#39;s - great product. Not only did they eradicate almost all of the &quot;lace bite&quot; I used to suffer (I used to have to unlace my skates between periods just to get circulation flowing and to relieve pain) but the best feature was they allowed me to tighten my laces much tighter than normal, giving my skates a better fit. I will definately be ordering more when it becomes necessary. Thanks..&quot;<br>

 &quot;I just wanted to write to advise you of how pleased I am with your product. I&#39;m always looking for an edge in my game, so, was skeptical about the value of these inserts when I first read about, and ordered, them. Well, after using them for just two games, I would never skate without them again. You don&#39;t even know your using them since they are so comfortable. I have never, ever, been able to tighten up my skates as much as I do now. Greater comfort, support/stability, and feel while skating now. Subjectively, I truly believe that these API inserts are now helping me skate better than I ever have. Thanks for developing and producing such a wonderful product. <br>
<br>
Best Regards.&quot; <br>

&quot;I purchased some API&#39;s a few months ago. These things are great for comforting my lace bite... I usually play about 3 times a week on average. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the product!.&quot; <br>

&quot;I refereed 300+ youth/adult hockey games in 2002. My lace bite was so bad my performance was being affected. I tried gel pads with little relief. I bought API in April of 2002. API allowed my ankles to heal and brought back comfort and enjoyment on the ice. Thanks for a great product, it makes me a better ref.&quot; <br>

&quot;I want to thank you for developing such an excellent product. I just tried your API &#39;s out during a 90 min. practice session. More stable, gave me confidence immediately, my Tacks felt like slippers, just one less thing to worry about. Went longer and skated harder than I ever had. Not bad for a 47 year old dude chasing the young turks around! Amazingly simple, yet totally effective. <br>
<br>
Thanks again, I&#39;m trying to convince my team-mates to invest in a pair. Take Care.&quot; <br>

&quot;I just wanted to pass on my thanks for your great product. High insteps cause me to get horrible lace bite no matter how I lace up. I will keep an eye out for when you start offering more brands on your site. Keep on fighting the good fight.&quot; <br>

              &quot;An ankle injury can make playing hockey pretty tough, especially in the pro ranks. Although my injury wasn&#39;t enough to keep me out of the line up, I still needed something that would make my skates more comfortable and at the same time protect me from further injury. It was at this time that I got my hands on API and I&#39;ve been using these great inserts ever since.&quot; <br>

&quot;I&#39;m always working on improving my game: finding the right hockey stick and curve for my shot, staying late after practices, etc. So when I saw API for the first time I had to try them. To my surprise I found that they really work and because I put some importance on how I look, I like the fact that nobody knows you&#39;re wearing them. Thanks for everything API Hockey!&quot; <br>

&quot;Got the inserts this week, took them to a local Canadian Tire and found a well fitting pair of 8 ½ CCM Tacks to use them with, after that I went skating on the Rideau canal skateway we have here in Ottawa. Success! _ a very solid feeling while skating, much more comfort around the ankle and particularly liked how much easier it is to get the skates OFF with the inserts, as the laces are not tightened to the extremes I used to go to in order to get enough support. <br>
<br>
Thanks very much.&quot; <br>

&quot;Surprise! Surprise! Who would have known that such a simple piece of equipment would make such a difference. For years, the first thing that I would do after a game is unlace my skates to relieve the pressure and pain. Now, my skates usually stay on atleast until my third trip to the beer cooler.<br>
<br>
I asked my foot doctor why I had pain and why your product worked for me. He explained that I have high arches that fall due to high flexibility in my foot (my foot twists like a rag at 90E... 45E is normal)... causes pain. Also, people who have high arches have a bone which makes a &quot;lump&quot; on the top part of the foot. This area is also where a main artery, which supplies blood the the toe area, is located. When I put on my skates, the pressure applied by the laces to this &quot;lump&quot; is so great that circulation to the toes is affected... numbness always occurs.<br>
<br>
API makes my skate fit better which reduces my foot rotation and also greatly reduces the pressure applied by the laces and therefore, I have no more numbness... at all!<br>
<br>
Simple,...comfortable,...youre a genius! API works!<br>
<br>
Thanks Marco,<br>

&quot;When I first heard of the product, I was a bit sceptical on what Marco told me that it would do. So I decided I had to try it out for myself. When I put them on for the first time, to tell ya the truth, it was very comfortable and the inserts soon took shape in my skates and it felt great. I feel somewhat lighter on my feet and I can feel that my ankles are well supported. Ever since the day I put them on, there hasn&#39;t been a hockey game that I&#39;ve played yet without them. I would recommend them to anyone because you will feel the change in your skating. <br>

&quot;I&#39;m writing a note to say thank you. I&#39;ll admit, I was doubtful that the API was the solution. My 10 year old son, Keenan, always complained about having sore feet after playing hockey. We tried different things; tighten skates, loosen skates, tie the skates higher, tie the skates lower, even different skates, but nothing worked. Since Keenan has the API he only went without them once and for that time only he had sore feet afterwards. We know the API made a difference. He faithfully wears the API and enjoys the game a whole lot more.<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>

&quot;As for the API product, I have used them several times and then skated without them to better compare. I am completely satisfied. Not only does it protect the top of my ankle from lace bite ,but it also helps keep my heel in the socket. As a result I have more skate control which translates into tighter turns ,faster take off as well as cleaner stops. I wish you the best of luck in marketing your great product and look forward to anything else that you may be working on in the future.<br>
<br>
Thanks again Sincerely , Richard&quot;<br>

<br>
After hearing about this new product, I had to find out what all the fuss was about. It didnt take me long to find out the benefits you can get from wearing them. I was impressed by the way they conformed to my ankles and the way I could finally tie my skates as tight as I wanted without worrying about ankle pain and blood flow to my feet. I was especially delighted to know that the API also protected my ankles from surface impact as I found out when I had to block a shot which otherwise would have hurt Im sure! <br>
<br>
I will faithfully wear my API for as long as I play. <br>
<br>
Thanks API Hockey&quot;<br>

&quot;Just wanted to thank you for those API&#39;s! I used them with my inline skates I bought a couple of years ago and that I use during the summer to fool around with on the street with the kids. <br>
<br>
Anyway I usually end up with sore feet and bruised shins every time I wear them. I have a pair of Bauer inline skates made with a REAL skate boot so the tongue is tough and usually digs into my shins really good every time I use them. Well ... I have used them over and over again this summer and all I can say is WOW! What a feeling. No pain! And as a bonus I had much better support because I could tie them up tighter than usual. I could twist and turn like never before and a few times I forgot I was not on the ice - ouch! This product is awesome. I have tried all sorts alternatives through the years but I could never find something that worked as consistent as the API&#39;s. Every time I wear them they work the same. They don&#39;t feel less thick than the previous time. They are always just right. <br>
<br>
Thanks again Marco. Keep up the good work :)&quot;<br>

&quot;Dear API Hockey, <br>
<br>
My son Cory had been going through a difficult time at the start of this hockey season. He had developed blisters at the front and sides of his ankles which made it quite difficult to skate and to enjoy playing. Having heard about this new product I quickly decided to buy a pair for him. Im very happy to say that Cory now skates pain free. When I ask how they feel he replies, They dont feel like anything, its as if theyre not there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks API Hockey&quot; <br>

&quot;Finally got to utilize the API&#39;s - great product. Not only did they eradicate almost all of the &quot;lace bite&quot; I used to suffer (I used to have to unlace my skates between periods just to get circulation flowing and to relieve pain) but the best feature was they allowed me to tighten my laces much tighter than normal, giving my skates a better fit. I will definately be ordering more when it becomes necessary. Thanks..&quot;<br>

 &quot;I just wanted to write to advise you of how pleased I am with your product. I&#39;m always looking for an edge in my game, so, was skeptical about the value of these inserts when I first read about, and ordered, them. Well, after using them for just two games, I would never skate without them again. You don&#39;t even know your using them since they are so comfortable. I have never, ever, been able to tighten up my skates as much as I do now. Greater comfort, support/stability, and feel while skating now. Subjectively, I truly believe that these API inserts are now helping me skate better than I ever have. Thanks for developing and producing such a wonderful product. <br>
<br>
Best Regards.&quot; <br>

&quot;I purchased some API&#39;s a few months ago. These things are great for comforting my lace bite... I usually play about 3 times a week on average. <br>

Thanks for the product!.&quot; <br>

&quot;I refereed 300+ youth/adult hockey games in 2002. My lace bite was so bad my performance was being affected. I tried gel pads with little relief. I bought API in April of 2002. API allowed my ankles to heal and brought back comfort and enjoyment on the ice. Thanks for a great product, it makes me a better ref.&quot; <br>

&quot;I want to thank you for developing such an excellent product. I just tried your API &#39;s out during a 90 min. practice session. More stable, gave me confidence immediately, my Tacks felt like slippers, just one less thing to worry about. Went longer and skated harder than I ever had. Not bad for a 47 year old dude chasing the young turks around! Amazingly simple, yet totally effective. <br>
<br>
Thanks again, I&#39;m trying to convince my team-mates to invest in a pair. Take Care.&quot; <br>

&quot;I just wanted to pass on my thanks for your great product. High insteps cause me to get horrible lace bite no matter how I lace up. I will keep an eye out for when you start offering more brands on your site. Keep on fighting the good fight.&quot; <br>
