              Consulting Services<br>
<br>
IT Consulting Services has now taken center stage, transforming customer experience, business operations and the way we work together. To maximize the opportunities presented by the digital revolution, companies need to align business IT and security with strategy, using digital solutions and intelligence as an enabler for innovation and growth.<br>
<br>
Consulting Services<br>
<br>
As an independent firm, we find the solution that is right for your business – we don’t sell you the product that is right for us. We combine our specializations and the knowledge of our most experienced people into a team that works well with you and for you, giving you the insight you need and challenging your approach to create exceptional IT solutions with lasting impact.<br>
<br>
We help organizations make the best use of information technology to achieve their business objectives in the most comprehensive manner.<br>
<br>
Each business is unique and has its own IT requirements. While larger organizations meet these requirements through an in-house team, small and mid-sized businesses (SME) largely depend on IT consultants to provide valuable advice and recommendations at an affordable cost.<br>
<br>
IT Bridges is one of the leading IT Consulting Services providers in the GTA that has been helping SMEs meet their daily or periodical IT requirements most cost-effectively. Our IT consulting services are designed to help you deal with technical challenges and give you a distinctive edge over your competitors.<br>
<br>
Depending on your requirements, we can provide external advice, recommendations as well as extend our special expertise to manage temporary projects, where hiring of permanent employees is not required.<br>
We See Things that You May Have Overlooked.<br>
<br>
Whether you have a technical background or not, there are a number of factors that you can miss while managing and maintaining your IT infrastructure. Moreover, organizations that cannot afford to have an in-house team of IT experts are also at a risk of taking wrong decision. IT Bridges’ consultants have the experience and the expertise to provide answers to the questions related to your IT infrastructure. Our specialized expertise in estimating, overseeing, and managing IT systems makes us the best choice for advising you on various matters related to information technology. We are capable of providing you with a fresh perspective to a problem, along with more objective advice and recommendations, to help you take better decisions.<br>
We Solve Problems Faster and Better.<br>

              Managed Services<br>
<br>
Unlike the old “break-fix” IT Support model, our Managed Services align the interest of the service provider “in this case, IT Bridges” with those of the client – namely you. Both parties desire for the client’s network to be absolutely stable – because they both lose money when anything goes wrong. In the event of downtime, you lose productivity, while we lose our most precious resource – technical support<br>
Managed Servicestime. As a result of this alignment, we are incentivised to work harder and smarter to ensure that your network remains 100% stable.<br>
<br>
    You pay a fixed monthly fee for us to keep your network up and running, no matter what.<br>
    There is no limit to the number of hours you can use.<br>
    We are incentivised to keep your network as stable as possible!<br>
    We do all of the proactive maintenance we can to achieve optimal network stability.<br>
    In order to achieve that, we’ve made significant investment in the latest network management systems.<br>
    You enjoy the benefits of enterprise-level automation and monitoring systems.<br>
    Our response times are backed by a comprehensive SLA (Service Level Agreement).<br>
    Monthly IT servicing on your company network, workstations and notebooks.<br>
    Track, report and resolve all IT problems as they arise.<br>
    Security management, ensuring all software is up to date.<br>
    Ensure your systems are all virus/spyware/malware free.<br>
    Reduce downtime; foresee problems before it impacts your business.<br>

Our Pro-active IT Support measures include:<br>

Connecting People<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Like many companies over the past 25 years, my husband and I decided to incorporate computers to make work easier and more productive but in the process we learned that we also needed to have someone to take care of the frequent problems that can be encountered with computers. Over the years we tried many different computer repair services, many were unreliable and some downright dishonest, often we felt as if it was a make work project at our expense, so we would move on to another such company until we finally had enough and did not trust any of them.<br>
Word of mouth has always been the best advertising for any company and one day when I was complaining to a friend about computers and the so called service providers, she told me of her friend a computer engineer. She arranged for us to meet Abdel and his company IT Bridges, from that day on we never looked back, we finally met someone with &quot;HONESTY and INTEGRITY&quot;. When our computers needed a clean-up or maintenance, Abdel was there and when our system needed to be replaced, he was there to take care of it for us and guide us through the most effective but economical ways to go. We learned a lot including the importance of having our own server. Abdel would always advise us of the best approach both for efficiency and cost and we learned to trust him and his judgement, as he would never steer us wrong or charge us unjustly. Thank you Abdel and IT Bridges for coming into our lives when you did, we only wish it had been years earlier.<br>

When I retired from full time work, I decided to begin a new company part-time, I knew Abdel and his company IT Bridges, from my previous work and I always admired his work ethics and so I asked him to help me with my home based business and the setup my computer to accommodate me in my new ventures, which he encouragingly did. I know that if I ever have a problem with my computer, I can call on him and he will always make the time for me and be fair and reasonable with his costs. Thank you Abdel and IT Bridges, may you continue to grow with enough clients to enrich your life without sacrifice to your health or your credibility.<br>

Just wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for your team. To be honest we were concerned that inviting your team to assist our internal IT team would create anxiety for our people as well impact the direction we wanted to take .<br>
<br>
However, by the end of our first meeting it was clear that the resources you brought to the job were professional, and knowledgeable. We appreciated that you took the time to understand our current needs, but also asked the right questions to clarify the IT needs to help us with our plans moving forward.<br>
<br>
As the project moved forward it was clear you understood our objectives. You provided solutions that have facilitated smoother work processes, reduced operating costs and helped us to better organize and manage our data storage.<br>

              Consulting Services<br>
<br>
IT Consulting Services has now taken center stage, transforming customer experience, business operations and the way we work together. To maximize the opportunities presented by the digital revolution, companies need to align business IT and security with strategy, using digital solutions and intelligence as an enabler for innovation and growth.<br>
<br>
Consulting Services<br>
<br>
As an independent firm, we find the solution that is right for your business – we don’t sell you the product that is right for us. We combine our specializations and the knowledge of our most experienced people into a team that works well with you and for you, giving you the insight you need and challenging your approach to create exceptional IT solutions with lasting impact.<br>
<br>
We help organizations make the best use of information technology to achieve their business objectives in the most comprehensive manner.<br>
<br>
Each business is unique and has its own IT requirements. While larger organizations meet these requirements through an in-house team, small and mid-sized businesses (SME) largely depend on IT consultants to provide valuable advice and recommendations at an affordable cost.<br>
<br>
IT Bridges is one of the leading IT Consulting Services providers in the GTA that has been helping SMEs meet their daily or periodical IT requirements most cost-effectively. Our IT consulting services are designed to help you deal with technical challenges and give you a distinctive edge over your competitors.<br>
<br>
Depending on your requirements, we can provide external advice, recommendations as well as extend our special expertise to manage temporary projects, where hiring of permanent employees is not required.<br>
We See Things that You May Have Overlooked.<br>
<br>
Whether you have a technical background or not, there are a number of factors that you can miss while managing and maintaining your IT infrastructure. Moreover, organizations that cannot afford to have an in-house team of IT experts are also at a risk of taking wrong decision. IT Bridges’ consultants have the experience and the expertise to provide answers to the questions related to your IT infrastructure. Our specialized expertise in estimating, overseeing, and managing IT systems makes us the best choice for advising you on various matters related to information technology. We are capable of providing you with a fresh perspective to a problem, along with more objective advice and recommendations, to help you take better decisions.<br>
We Solve Problems Faster and Better.<br>

              Managed Services<br>
<br>
Unlike the old “break-fix” IT Support model, our Managed Services align the interest of the service provider “in this case, IT Bridges” with those of the client – namely you. Both parties desire for the client’s network to be absolutely stable – because they both lose money when anything goes wrong. In the event of downtime, you lose productivity, while we lose our most precious resource – technical support<br>
Managed Servicestime. As a result of this alignment, we are incentivised to work harder and smarter to ensure that your network remains 100% stable.<br>
<br>
    You pay a fixed monthly fee for us to keep your network up and running, no matter what.<br>
    There is no limit to the number of hours you can use.<br>
    We are incentivised to keep your network as stable as possible!<br>
    We do all of the proactive maintenance we can to achieve optimal network stability.<br>
    In order to achieve that, we’ve made significant investment in the latest network management systems.<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Like many companies over the past 25 years, my husband and I decided to incorporate computers to make work easier and more productive but in the process we learned that we also needed to have someone to take care of the frequent problems that can be encountered with computers. Over the years we tried many different computer repair services, many were unreliable and some downright dishonest, often we felt as if it was a make work project at our expense, so we would move on to another such company until we finally had enough and did not trust any of them.<br>
Word of mouth has always been the best advertising for any company and one day when I was complaining to a friend about computers and the so called service providers, she told me of her friend a computer engineer. She arranged for us to meet Abdel and his company IT Bridges, from that day on we never looked back, we finally met someone with &quot;HONESTY and INTEGRITY&quot;. When our computers needed a clean-up or maintenance, Abdel was there and when our system needed to be replaced, he was there to take care of it for us and guide us through the most effective but economical ways to go. We learned a lot including the importance of having our own server. Abdel would always advise us of the best approach both for efficiency and cost and we learned to trust him and his judgement, as he would never steer us wrong or charge us unjustly. Thank you Abdel and IT Bridges for coming into our lives when you did, we only wish it had been years earlier.<br>

When I retired from full time work, I decided to begin a new company part-time, I knew Abdel and his company IT Bridges, from my previous work and I always admired his work ethics and so I asked him to help me with my home based business and the setup my computer to accommodate me in my new ventures, which he encouragingly did. I know that if I ever have a problem with my computer, I can call on him and he will always make the time for me and be fair and reasonable with his costs. Thank you Abdel and IT Bridges, may you continue to grow with enough clients to enrich your life without sacrifice to your health or your credibility.<br>

Just wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for your team. To be honest we were concerned that inviting your team to assist our internal IT team would create anxiety for our people as well impact the direction we wanted to take .<br>
<br>
However, by the end of our first meeting it was clear that the resources you brought to the job were professional, and knowledgeable. We appreciated that you took the time to understand our current needs, but also asked the right questions to clarify the IT needs to help us with our plans moving forward.<br>
<br>
As the project moved forward it was clear you understood our objectives. You provided solutions that have facilitated smoother work processes, reduced operating costs and helped us to better organize and manage our data storage.<br>
