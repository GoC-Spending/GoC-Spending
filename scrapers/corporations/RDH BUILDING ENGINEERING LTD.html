                            Whether renewing specific assemblies or conducting a complete building enclosure rehabilitation, RDH has the skills and experience to ensure your project proceeds smoothly.<br>
<br>
There are 5 primary aspects to building repair, renewal and rehabilitation: Planning, Construction Documents, Field Review, Field Testing, and Post-Construction + Maintenance Planning.<br>
<br>
Planning<br>
<br>
During the planning phase, or design phase, RDH will work with you and your owner group to confirm and refine the specifics of the renewal or rehabilitation program. Together we consider alternate ways of addressing renewal or rehabilitation needs. Is a full or partial rehabilitation the best option? Should all membranes be renewed at the same time or is a phased approach preferable? What options exist for replacement windows? Are there energy savings alternatives that would be cost-effective to implement? We believe that owners should be fully involved in considering the benefits, risks, and costs of various approaches and phasing alternatives.<br>
<br>
For larger projects, the planning phase is also important because it provides a real opportunity to update and enhance the appearance of the building. Many of the building enclosure projects we work on have a positive impact on property values. Significant improvements in the overall appearance and attractiveness of buildings can be achieved with relatively minor and low-cost modifications to the rehabilitation or renewals program. All necessary services, both engineering and architecture, are provided in-house by RDH.<br>
<br>
Construction Documents<br>
<br>
Construction documents are the drawings and specifications that are used to obtain the necessary permits and obtain bids from contractors. Once the contractors have been selected, the construction documents are used by the contractors to carry out the renewal or rehabilitation work on-site. These drawings and specifications are one of the most important parts of the whole rehabilitation or renewal process.<br>
<br>
It has been our experience that the accuracy and completeness of the construction documents bear directly on the cost and quality of the construction work. In order to fully explain the work, avoid misunderstanding, and obtain the best possible pricing, we prepare a highly detailed construction document package, one that is much more comprehensive than is typical in the industry.<br>
<br>
Field Review<br>
<br>
Field review includes the work involved in visiting the building during construction to monitor progress, confirm that the work is being implemented correctly, and ensure that the contractor has a full and detailed understanding of all requirements. This is an essential part of protecting your interests and making sure that the necessary quality standards are achieved.<br>
<br>
Field Testing<br>
<br>
In addition to visual field review, undertaken to confirm that specified materials and components are being used and correctly installed, our field review staff also carry out a variety of tests to help to confirm that the completed project will achieve the necessary levels of performance. A range of tests, including water penetration tests, airtightness testing, and membrane and coating adherence tests, ensure that appropriate industry standards are achieved.<br>
<br>
Post-Construction + Maintenance Planning<br>
<br>
Inevitably, when projects near completion there’s a desire to wrap things up quickly and move on. Owners particularly, after living through the construction process, want to get on with their lives. However, we believe that a number of key tasks need to be carried out in order to properly document the project and provide owners with the necessary information to effectively maintain their buildings.<br>
<br>
We follow-up on outstanding issues from the construction project to ensure that they are resolved, and we provide documentation of the completed project to you that will be very helpful in the ongoing upkeep of the building. Our field review staff work with other in-house specialists to develop clear and effective maintenance documentation and to ensure that all applicable warranties are in place.<br>

                            No two buildings are identical, no two building enclosure projects are the same, and no single implementation approach works for all rehabilitation projects. At RDH, we recognize the differences. We offer the following services within Construction Project Management:<br>
<br>
Pre-Construction<br>
<br>
Before work starts on-site, the rehabilitation project needs to be thoroughly thought-through, designed, budgeted, and made ready. Effective pre-construction planning is essential for any successful project.<br>
<br>
Clients need concise information, the opportunity to make informed decisions, accurate estimates, and a realistic understanding of what needs to be done.<br>
<br>
At RDH, we’ve been helping clients find ways to deal with a range of challenging construction implementation issues. We help make sure building enclosure issues are resolved with practical, durable, cost-effective solutions.<br>
<br>
Contract Administration<br>
<br>
Every construction project needs to be controlled, and the best control comes from appropriate administration of the construction contract. RDH uses industry-recognized processes and procedures to keep things on-track.<br>
<br>
We tender (bid) the work to qualified contractors, review the work on-site, certify payments, dot the i’s, cross the t’s, and provide ongoing advice and support to our clients. In other words, we do all the things a professional consultant should do to properly administer a construction contract.<br>
<br>
Project Management<br>
<br>
When clients want an added layer of proactive support, RDH can provide Project Management services. As project managers, RDH actively manages the construction process from initial design to project completion.<br>
<br>
In addition to typical administrative functions, RDH can arrange permits, deal with hazardous materials, liaise with WorkSafe BC or OSHA , and proactively work to keep contractors on-schedule and on-budget. As project managers, RDH provides clients with regular cost reporting, cost forecasts, scheduling updates, and an elevated level of client support.<br>
<br>
Construction Management<br>
<br>
On projects that are large, complex, and challenging—or simply require innovative solutions—RDH is often retained to act as construction manager. In addition to conventional administrative duties, as construction managers RDH takes firm control of all construction-related activities and provides a full-time site superintendent to actively manage the work.<br>
<br>
This elevated level of service provides control and oversight that just isn’t possible with other approaches. Many of the largest, most high-profile building enclosure rehabilitations in the Pacific Northwest and the Lower Mainland have been managed by RDH’s construction managers. RDH has built a reputation for safely delivering innovative, cost-effective, durable solutions.<br>
<br>
Cost-Estimating<br>
<br>
Of fundamental concern to all clients is “What is this going to cost?” Our clients require well-founded cost estimates to make informed decisions. Since its inception, RDH has directly or indirectly managed the repair, renewal, or rehabilitation of more than 1000 buildings.Each of these buildings is different, and each one contributes to our collective experience and knowledge base.<br>
<br>
As we complete projects, we collect related costing data; and as we plan new projects, we can refer to this in-house costing data to track trends and analyze recent bid results. This allows us to more accurately estimate the probable cost of pending work.<br>

                            Our Maintenance and Planning (MaP) group works with your owner group to plan and develop strategies for the long- and short-term needs of your building – everything from roof maintenance to boiler replacement. As the acronym suggests, our services are designed so that we can provide you with a comprehensive roadMaP for the management of your assets.<br>
<br>
What is MaP?<br>
<br>
Our MaP group works with your strata or HOA to plan and develop strategies for the long- and short-term needs for your building – everything from roof maintenance to boiler replacement. As the acronym suggests, our products are designed so that we can provide you with a comprehensive roadMaP for the management of your assets.<br>
<br>
Our Building Asset Management Software application enables you to evaluate and track your maintenance activities and make informed decisions about how to preserve your assets and keep costs under control. The software provides you with many other helpful tools such as a building contacts list and online document storage capability.<br>
<br>
Reserve Studies / Depreciation Reports<br>
<br>
A reserve study (called a depreciation report in British Columbia) is a long-range financial planning tool. It’s used to identify funding requirements for costs associated with future repair, renewal, and replacement projects. The report establishes where you need to focus resources and is a good place to start developing your roadMAP.<br>
<br>
The first step in the preparing the report is to compile an inventory of all of your building’s assets (roofs, boilers, carpets, etc.). Using the inventory as a foundation, we estimate the remaining life of each asset, forecast the replacement costs in future-year dollars, and display the financial analysis with graphs and cash flow tables.<br>
<br>
Recognizing that a picture speaks a thousand words, we provide a photo library accompanied by related data pertaining to your assets. All of the information is accessible through our propriety online BAM software that allows you to update manage the data yourself. The software tool also empowers you to create your own funding scenarios so you can evaluate different funding levels and find a solution that works specifically for your building.<br>
<br>
Maintenance Plans + Reviews<br>
<br>
Maintenance plans help you keep your building assets (e.g., boilers, pumps, elevators) in good working condition so that they achieve their full-intended service life.<br>
<br>
Where a reserve study (depreciation report) identifies what items you need to spend money on and when you need to spend it, this tool helps you optimize the way you spend your money. Ultimately, we can help you track what work is completed vs. what is outstanding so that you are better able to produce reports and make informed decisions.<br>
<br>
Maintenance plans move you further along in the roadMAP by helping you answer the following questions:<br>
<br>
How do you keep track of all the drawings, shut-off valves, warranties and service agreements, certificates, and historical events required to efficiently manage your building?<br>
How do you get all of this information in one place so that it is easy to reference?<br>
How long will your building assets last?<br>
What maintenance and renewals work is needed to preserve your assets?<br>
What is the value of the maintenance and renewals work for this year and for the next 30 years?<br>
<br>
Interim Study<br>
<br>
Once a depreciation report (reserve study) or a maintenance plan has been completed, there can be several years between mandatory update studies. An interim study is a cost-effective way to record progress that has been made on your projects (such as a roof renewal or window replacement). This is beneficial if you would like to showcase large projects that have been completed and have the information reflected in an updated report for potential purchasers.<br>
<br>
An interim study does not typically involve a site visit; revisions are made to our existing report based on information provided by you. The content of this study may vary between jurisdictions, please contact the office nearest you to get information relevant to your state or province.<br>
<br>
Facility Condition Assessments (FCA)<br>
<br>
A facility condition assessment is a multidisciplinary review of the various building systems for an owner of a portfolio of buildings (municipality, university, school, or hospital) that:<br>
<br>
Determines the condition of the assets (such as roofs and boilers).<br>
Records the extent of deferred maintenance (“catch-up” costs).<br>
Forecasts future life cycle renewal of the assets (“keep-up” costs).<br>
The purpose of the assessment is to prepare a defensible estimate of reinvestment costs so that prudent and informed decisions can be made regarding allocating funds to restore aging assets and to sustain their ongoing performance relative to established goals and standards.<br>
<br>
The FCA provides a benchmark of the current performance of the building and prioritizes items for maintenance, repair, and/or renewal. The data is summarized in a Facility Condition Index (FCI) that provides an objective benchmark against which changes can be monitored over time.<br>
<br>
Our team comprises specialists in the fields of building science, architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical, cost consulting, and construction management. We are very familiar with facility rehabilitation costs, renewal costs, and life cycle audits. Our experience also includes various types of specialized facilities such as swimming pools, ice rinks, community centres, fire stations, and hotels.<br>

                            To make responsible decisions regarding your building, you need to know what its current condition is and understand the cause of any performance problems. RDH will help you gather the right information and guide you in your decision-making process.<br>
<br>
Problem Investigation<br>
<br>
Performance problems can vary widely in scope and severity. For example, they can include:<br>
<br>
Thermal comfort issues (drafts, overheating)<br>
Condensation on walls and windows<br>
The presence of mold<br>
Water entering the interior spaces of a building<br>
Leaky windows or roofs<br>
Premature deterioration of components of the building<br>
To cost-effectively address these types of problems, it’s important to understand the root cause of problems, not just the symptoms. RDH’s advanced building science expertise is the key to focussed investigations and being able to help you undertake the right repairs.<br>
<br>
We use a variety of investigative tools including water penetration test equipment, infrared thermography, moisture meters, and dew point testers.<br>
<br>
Condition Assessment<br>
<br>
We examine all aspects of a building or a building system to determine its existing condition and prognosis for future performance. This snapshot of conditions is a baseline that helps us provide you with advice regarding maintenance activities, repair and renewal recommendations, or the development of a large rehabilitation program. This broad understanding of the current condition and performance means that activities can be planned in the proper sequence, activities can be bundled to be cost-effective, alternate approaches can be identified where appropriate, and opportunities for energy efficiency can be examined with the big picture in mind.<br>
<br>
The condition assessment process typically consists of:<br>
<br>
Reviewing available drawings, reports, or other documentation.<br>
Visually examining building components.<br>
Surveying owners and occupants to identify problematic conditions.<br>
Conducting a moisture probe survey.<br>
Creating exploratory openings.<br>
Using nondestructive testing such as water penetration testing.<br>
At the conclusion of the assessment work, our observations regarding the current condition as well as our recommendations are presented to you and documented in a report that summarizes the information in an easy-to-understand manner, including supportive sketches and photographs.<br>
<br>
Warranty Review<br>
<br>
Our goal in undertaking warranty reviews is to help you resolve issues with the warranty provider in an equitable manner. The escalation of a dispute is in nobody’s best interest and can result in additional costs from simply managing conflict. Warranty reviews are also one of the signals that the responsibility for the long-term in-service performance of the building is being transferred fully to you as owners. RDH is ready to help you assume and plan for this stewardship role at your building.<br>
<br>
The visual review of the building and examination of the construction documents undertaken during a warranty review is a great starting point for us in getting to know your building and its unique character. The warranty review leads quite naturally to the development of a depreciation report/reserve study and maintenance plans.<br>

                            At RDH, we believe every renewal or renovation project should be viewed as an opportunity to cost-effectively implement energy efficiency measures that save you energy and money.<br>
<br>
Energy Saving Opportunities<br>
<br>
Energy efficiency for existing buildings is becoming a priority for many municipalities and more senior levels of government. It is likely that, as buildings are renovated, there will be new requirements for looking at energy efficiency. These new requirements should not be feared, as energy efficiency should be a priority for building owners and managers.<br>
<br>
Every renewal or renovation project can be viewed as an opportunity to cost-effectively implement energy efficiency measures that save you energy and money. At RDH, we understand this changing environment; we frequently provide assistance to jurisdictions as they update their energy requirements. We use this knowledge to help building owners, managers, and operators stay ahead of the curve by:<br>
<br>
Benchmarking: a great starting point is learning how your building or portfolio compares to other buildings.<br>
Looking for energy saving opportunities: energy audits help you understand the systems that consume energy within your buildings and help you identify cost-effective energy savings opportunities.<br>
Using available incentives: government- and utility-sponsored incentives can reduce capital costs and payback periods.<br>
Tying energy into Building Asset Management Services (BAMS): the best time to implement energy saving measures is when planning for the replacement of building assets.<br>
<br>
Benchmarking<br>
<br>
Benchmarking is a low-cost way to compare the energy performance of your building with a database of similar buildings. This comparison identifies underperforming buildings as well as superior performance and provides a tool for tracking and comparing energy consumption from year to year.<br>
<br>
A recent study by ENERGY STAR indicated that on average, buildings that are benchmarked annually use 2.4% less energy than those that aren’t, just because people are more aware of energy performance.<br>
<br>
This can add up. Over 10 years, you’re looking at almost 20% energy savings from when you started!<br>

                            Our goal is to see every building enclosure meet both code compliance and performance expectations. <br>
<br>
Concept Review<br>
<br>
Before detailed decisions are finalized, our clients benefit from a review of the building enclosure design strategies at a conceptual level. This review provides an opportunity to reflect on the basic building science behind the selection of specific assemblies and materials. Experience shows that changes made at the conceptual stage of building envelope design have far less cost impact than those made during construction. A typical Concept Review considers the following:<br>
<br>
 - Environmental loads<br>
 - Energy performance targets and compliance options<br>
 - Life cycle expectations<br>
 - Constructability, sequencing, and complexity of detailing<br>
 - Structural support<br>
<br>
Risk Review<br>
<br>
Not all of RDH’s clients are able to utilize the entire design and construction process to manage risk. There are, however, strategic opportunities during the design and construction process when a focused effort to assess risk and identify mitigating actions can be beneficial to a project stakeholder. RDH has practical methodologies to aid any participant at any stage of the design and construction process. While each client’s needs are unique, the building science and practical approach offered by RDH is consistent with all of our services.<br>
<br>
Construction Document Review<br>
<br>
We focus on the details for our clients. There are many design team members involved in the coordination and correlation of construction drawings. We are typically tasked with reviewing the details for integration of the various building enclosure assemblies. This review also includes the identification of additional details needed to convey the design intent.<br>
<br>
Our clients also look to RDH to review specifications to confirm they are coordinated with drawings and convey appropriate performance requirements. Our goal is construction details that work, are easy to construct, meet best practice standards, and ultimately have less opportunity for unresolved conditions on-site.<br>
<br>
Field Review<br>
<br>
Our field review work provides clients with assurance that construction is conforming to drawings and specifications. The success of any project is dependent on a high level of quality assurance and quality control.<br>
<br>
Our field review personnel contribute to the project team’s quality assurance success by conducting regular and thorough reviews of the building enclosure construction. RDH field review staff are experienced personnel with a track record of successful projects and an interest in working cooperatively in a team environment.<br>
<br>
We communicate our field review work to the project team by documenting and tracking field observations in a project-specific database. Our clients appreciate that we use digital photographs to illustrate deficiencies and recommended actions whenever possible. Project team members also utilize the database because it allows outstanding action items to be tracked and reported at any time.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
<br>
In addition to regular and through field review of construction, we also regularly perform various on-site tests in our quality assurance role, including:<br>
<br>
 - Water penetration testing of glazing assemblies.<br>
 - Adhesion testing.<br>
 - Membrane thickness testing.<br>
 - Whole-building and assembly air leakage testing.<br>
 - Thermographic scanning and ultrasonic testing if required to help confirm the performance of new assemblies.<br>

RDH can analyze and provide an evaluation into the long-term behavior of any building enclosure assembly or detail for thermal and hygrothermal performance (heat, air, and moisture control).<br>
<br>
Utilizing state-of-the-art software (WUFI Pro 5.0, HEAT 3, THERM), thermal and hygrothermal simulations are used at various stages through the life cycle of a building for different purposes. Thermal modeling software is used to analyze one-, two-, and three-dimensional heat transfer under both steady-state and transient conditions.<br>
<br>
The majority of RDH technical staff have formal training in building science, including several staff members who hold master’s degrees with specializations in building science. This training is imperative to understanding coupled heat and moisture transfer and in successfully utilizing and interpreting the results output from analysis software.<br>
<br>
Because of our advanced building science understanding and depth of experience in the use of various building science software packages, we are able to provide training on those packages and on utilizing the results. Several RDH staff members regularly apply this knowledge in the instruction of students at universities and colleges on the west coast.<br>
<br>
Hygrothermal Modeling<br>
<br>
Hygrothermal modeling is the computer-assisted simulation of heat, air, and moisture flow through building enclosure assemblies (walls, roofs, floors, below-grade). It is the process of simulating the performance of assemblies so that the future durability and risk associated with different assembly designs, materials, and climate or exposure can be evaluated and assessed. For example, the risk for condensation within an assembly can be analyzed with different insulation or vapor retarder properties, or the influence of driving rain on cladding degradation can be predicted. The hygrothermal model results include temperature, humidity, and moisture content data at materials and at interfaces throughout the assembly. With this data, the user can assess the risk of condensation, moisture entrapment, fungal growth, and even material degradation.<br>
<br>
Thermal Modeling<br>
<br>
Thermal modeling is essential for establishing overall thermal performance values (R-values/U-values) and condensation potential. These tools are used to:<br>
<br>
 - Evaluate the performance of proposed roof, wall, and glazed assembly designs.<br>
 - Help design more thermally efficient and durable details.<br>
 - Provide insight on forensic analysis.<br>
 - Support energy code compliance documentation (i.e., ASHRAE 90.1) or energy credits for LEED projects.<br>

<br>
Manage Cost<br>
<br>
Curtain wall is often one of the largest contracts on a new construction project.  At RDH, we have an intimate knowledge of the design and construction features of most curtain wall systems on the market today. We have extensive experience with both North American and overseas products and supply chains. With this knowledge we can optimize the design to provide better value and improve performance, often for little or no additional cost.<br>
<br>
Avoid Failures<br>
<br>
Curtain wall and façade glazing systems are among the most complicated elements of a building’s enclosure, and are one of the most common post-construction claims. Early expert involvement that continues through the design and construction phases to the performance verification stages of commissioning can avoid post-construction deficiencies. Our proactive approach and extensive experience in investigating and repairing failures help us to quickly identify high risk areas and resolve issues before they become problems.<br>
<br>
Expert Design and System Analysis<br>
<br>
The curtain wall industry changes rapidly. New systems are constantly being brought to market, often without adequate due diligence or performance and durability testing.  New products and systems require careful evaluation prior to use in the real world.  Our background in curtain wall consulting on new projects, forensic investigations, and research and development of new glazing systems gives us the experience to realistically evaluate new systems. It also gives us the experience to design and implement additional test methods when required.<br>
<br>
Optimize Energy Performance<br>
<br>
Improved energy performance is the new frontier for glazed building enclosures. RDH has the resources to simulate, model, and optimize fenestration systems and anchorage and interface details to achieve the energy performance requirements for the most demanding design briefs.<br>
<br>
Design Drawings and Specifications<br>
<br>
Extensive experience with the design and testing of curtain wall systems allows us to quickly and efficiently review drawings, specifications and submittals to manage risk, optimize the system design, and ensure that performance parameters are not compromised through poor detailing.<br>
<br>
RDH also provides complete curtainwall design drawings and specifications for architectural teams wishing to outsource this component of the design.<br>
<br>
Product Testing and Field Review<br>
<br>
Independent lab testing under RDH supervision confirms the “as-built” performance of fenestration systems. Job site mock-up testing ensures that trades understand and can replicate the complex interfaces between fenestration products and the assemblies in which they are installed.<br>
<br>
During construction our experienced field personnel confirm that installed products and their interfaces to surrounding construction perform as designed, through a combination of field review and field testing.<br>
<br>
Performance Verification and Maintenance<br>
<br>
At the end of the project it is essential to confirm performance and hand over the glazing systems with adequate operations and maintenance guidance. RDH undertakes the performance verification testing and provides comprehensive guidance on maintenance and renewals.<br>

About Airtightness Testing<br>
Measuring and identifying air leakage in buildings is something that RDH staff members have been doing since our firm was founded and before “commissioning” was an industry term of art. Our staff members are some of the most experienced and knowledgeable in the industry as it relates to air barrier design and testing, including performing dozens of whole-building air leakage tests.<br>
<br>
We are active on the Air Barrier Association of America committee on air leakage testing, and our staff provided input on the Army Corps of Engineers Whole-Building Air Leakage Testing Protocol. We are often consulted by code officials and those who write air leakage testing standards for input. We were part of the team that developed the pressure-neutralized approach for incrementally testing portions of buildings. RDH is more than just another testing agency–our staff members have performed cutting-edge research on air leakage and understand how buildings and the air barrier are put together. This is what sets us apart.<br>
<br>
We specialize in:<br>
<br>
 - Whole-Building Air Leakage Testing<br>
 - Smoke Testing<br>
 - Thermography<br>

                            We can help with early-stage analysis, whole-building energy modeling, and energy code compliance.<br>
<br>
Early-Stage Modeling<br>
<br>
Our early-stage energy analysis occurs at the pre-schematic stage of design where we talk to you about:<br>
<br>
 - The overall enclosure R-value.<br>
 - Building massing and orientation.<br>
 - Basic assembly and fenestration arrangements and details.<br>
<br>
Our services for this optimization role can be handled as a small consulting package independent of any possible role as an energy modeler or building enclosure consultant at the schematic design (SD), design development (DD), construction documents (CD), and construction stages.<br>
<br>
Whole-Building Energy Modeling<br>
<br>
Whole-building energy modeling during DD, CD, and construction is a natural transition from the early-stage analysis we can provide for your project. This continues to optimize the building enclosure for energy performance while considering other building performance parameters such as the mechanical and electrical systems.<br>
<br>
Building Energy Code Compliance<br>
<br>
As local jursidictions and municipalities increase their energy efficiency requirements, we can help provide an understanding of how to get projects to be code compliant, particularly with respect to the building enclosure.<br>
<br>
This can include:<br>
<br>
 - ASHRAE 90.1 compliance to BCBC, City of Vancouver, or other code requirements.<br>
 - Thermal analysis, including R-value calculations for all building details.<br>
 - Assistance completing submission documentation where required by jurisdictions.<br>

                            RDH is committed to working with claims adjusters from all corners of the industry to ensure that the technical support required to adjust the claim is available in a timely and efficient manner.<br>
<br>
Warranty Claims Support<br>
<br>
Latent defect, labour and material, water ingress, and structural defect are some of the construction warranties available in the industry. All warranties result in claims. The initial identification of potential claims, documentation of existing and deteriorated performance, field testing, second opinion review, causation reporting, mediation, litigation support, and construction management or claim resolution measures, represent the range of services that RDH offers as part of the firm’s comprehensive warranty claim support services.<br>
<br>
It doesn’t matter if RDH has been retained by an owner, developer, supplier or a representative of the insurance industry: our goal is to define the problem and provide reasonable, cost-effective, and timely solutions.<br>
<br>
Property Insurance Claims Support<br>
<br>
Almost every significant property is protected by a comprehensive insurance policy. The building enclosure comprises well over half the replacement value of most structures, and contents rely on the building enclosure for protection against the elements. It is easy to see why enclosure consultants are of value to a property claims adjuster.<br>
<br>
Insured perils and exclusions may seem straightforward at first, but often expert and technical review is needed to address specific issues critical to the final determination of coverage. Even after coverage is established, RDH can address extent of damage and the methods and limits of repair or assist in subrogation and cost recovery efforts.<br>
<br>
Working closely with claims adjusters and specialist restoration contractors RDH has supported the resolution of property claims ranging from small residential matters to multimillion dollar loses.<br>
<br>
Surety Claims Support<br>
<br>
When contractors face solvency problems, performance bonds are often the first course of action to achieve project completion. Even when projects are completed, there can be problems whose various parties will look to performance bonds as a means of resolution.<br>
<br>
Claims adjusters and loss control specialists rely on RDH’s project and construction management expertise as well as our technical knowledge to address a wide range of  surety claims.<br>
<br>
RDH has the ability to step into the existing construction and project management contracts to assess completion costs and complete projects. We also offer the technical expertise to resolve claims related to faulty materials, improper installations, faulty construction, or design defects.<br>

                            We assist building product manufacturers and industry organizations with product research, development, testing, and performance monitoring.<br>
<br>
Product R&amp;D<br>
<br>
We have the depth of expertise to address all aspects of the building enclosure in detail. This means understanding of the behaviour of assemblies, components, and materials as well as the construction and design issues that will impact performance. We are known for our practical construction advice, advanced building science knowledge, and specialized analysis capabilities for building materials and assemblies.<br>
<br>
We have in-house laboratory testing facilities, a climate chamber, various building monitoring sites, and a full-scale test wall facility. Recent uses for the test wall facility include testing of window installation procedures, ICF wall systems and details, and various log wall assemblies and details.<br>
<br>
Building Monitoring + Diagnostic Testing<br>
<br>
Building performance monitoring consists of installing sensors and equipment to measure various indicators such as temperature, relative humidity, air quality levels, moisture levels, pressure differences, energy consumption, air flows, etc., over a period of time. These measured performance indicators allow us to better understand and solve problems within buildings, research new building products, and help make buildings perform better. We often use monitoring to diagnose problems such as intermittent leaks, condensation, moisture damage, structural movement, air quality problems, energy use, etc., and to confirm acceptable long-term performance of new building enclosure assemblies and details.<br>
<br>
In conjunction with building monitoring, we regularly perform testing of buildings to measure:<br>
<br>
 - Airtightness and air leakage using specialized fan-door equipment, theatrical smoke, and infrared imaging.<br>
 - Water penetration using calibrated spray racks and apparatuses.<br>
 - Indoor environmental conditions using various sensors.<br>
<br>
Although testing agencies can conduct testing, we find that our knowledge of the building enclosure systems and details allows us to better use the testing to determine the source of failures and provide quick feedback and resolution to effectively address any problems. In addition, as trial repairs are undertaken, the availability of our own test apparatuses allows us to quickly verify the effectiveness of the repairs.<br>

                            We are regularly called upon to assess why assemblies and components of the building enclosure fail.<br>
<br>
Forensic Investigation<br>
<br>
Whether the failure is condensation in walls or on windows, premature fogging of insulating glass units, the leakage of window or curtain wall assemblies, or the failure of an assembly as a roofing membrane or cladding material, RDH has the experience and knowledge to find the root of the problem. We use a variety of investigative techniques.<br>
<br>
Our ability to communicate complex technical issues is one of our greatest strengths.   This ability to communicate stems from a comprehensive understanding of the technical issues – real world design and construction experience, building science expertise, and a scientific approach to our forensic work.  We understand issues at a distinctly advanced level – a result of our specialized building science training and degrees held by many of our staff – and this allows us to be creative with solutions.<br>
<br>
Figuring out the problem is certainly important, but it’s only the first step.  Our ability to articulate a fundamental understanding of what went wrong and what to do about it through clear reports, excellent support graphics, and presentations is the key to helping you understand the issues and what should be done to address performance problems – this is what sets us apart.<br>

                            Whether renewing specific assemblies or conducting a complete building enclosure rehabilitation, RDH has the skills and experience to ensure your project proceeds smoothly.<br>
<br>
There are 5 primary aspects to building repair, renewal and rehabilitation: Planning, Construction Documents, Field Review, Field Testing, and Post-Construction + Maintenance Planning.<br>
<br>
Planning<br>
<br>
During the planning phase, or design phase, RDH will work with you and your owner group to confirm and refine the specifics of the renewal or rehabilitation program. Together we consider alternate ways of addressing renewal or rehabilitation needs. Is a full or partial rehabilitation the best option? Should all membranes be renewed at the same time or is a phased approach preferable? What options exist for replacement windows? Are there energy savings alternatives that would be cost-effective to implement? We believe that owners should be fully involved in considering the benefits, risks, and costs of various approaches and phasing alternatives.<br>
<br>
For larger projects, the planning phase is also important because it provides a real opportunity to update and enhance the appearance of the building. Many of the building enclosure projects we work on have a positive impact on property values. Significant improvements in the overall appearance and attractiveness of buildings can be achieved with relatively minor and low-cost modifications to the rehabilitation or renewals program. All necessary services, both engineering and architecture, are provided in-house by RDH.<br>
<br>
Construction Documents<br>
<br>
Construction documents are the drawings and specifications that are used to obtain the necessary permits and obtain bids from contractors. Once the contractors have been selected, the construction documents are used by the contractors to carry out the renewal or rehabilitation work on-site. These drawings and specifications are one of the most important parts of the whole rehabilitation or renewal process.<br>
<br>
It has been our experience that the accuracy and completeness of the construction documents bear directly on the cost and quality of the construction work. In order to fully explain the work, avoid misunderstanding, and obtain the best possible pricing, we prepare a highly detailed construction document package, one that is much more comprehensive than is typical in the industry.<br>
<br>
Field Review<br>
<br>
Field review includes the work involved in visiting the building during construction to monitor progress, confirm that the work is being implemented correctly, and ensure that the contractor has a full and detailed understanding of all requirements. This is an essential part of protecting your interests and making sure that the necessary quality standards are achieved.<br>
<br>
Field Testing<br>
<br>
In addition to visual field review, undertaken to confirm that specified materials and components are being used and correctly installed, our field review staff also carry out a variety of tests to help to confirm that the completed project will achieve the necessary levels of performance. A range of tests, including water penetration tests, airtightness testing, and membrane and coating adherence tests, ensure that appropriate industry standards are achieved.<br>
<br>
Post-Construction + Maintenance Planning<br>
<br>
Inevitably, when projects near completion there’s a desire to wrap things up quickly and move on. Owners particularly, after living through the construction process, want to get on with their lives. However, we believe that a number of key tasks need to be carried out in order to properly document the project and provide owners with the necessary information to effectively maintain their buildings.<br>
<br>
We follow-up on outstanding issues from the construction project to ensure that they are resolved, and we provide documentation of the completed project to you that will be very helpful in the ongoing upkeep of the building. Our field review staff work with other in-house specialists to develop clear and effective maintenance documentation and to ensure that all applicable warranties are in place.<br>

                            No two buildings are identical, no two building enclosure projects are the same, and no single implementation approach works for all rehabilitation projects. At RDH, we recognize the differences. We offer the following services within Construction Project Management:<br>
<br>
Pre-Construction<br>
<br>
Before work starts on-site, the rehabilitation project needs to be thoroughly thought-through, designed, budgeted, and made ready. Effective pre-construction planning is essential for any successful project.<br>
<br>
Clients need concise information, the opportunity to make informed decisions, accurate estimates, and a realistic understanding of what needs to be done.<br>
<br>
At RDH, we’ve been helping clients find ways to deal with a range of challenging construction implementation issues. We help make sure building enclosure issues are resolved with practical, durable, cost-effective solutions.<br>
<br>
Contract Administration<br>
<br>
Every construction project needs to be controlled, and the best control comes from appropriate administration of the construction contract. RDH uses industry-recognized processes and procedures to keep things on-track.<br>
<br>
We tender (bid) the work to qualified contractors, review the work on-site, certify payments, dot the i’s, cross the t’s, and provide ongoing advice and support to our clients. In other words, we do all the things a professional consultant should do to properly administer a construction contract.<br>
<br>
Project Management<br>
<br>
When clients want an added layer of proactive support, RDH can provide Project Management services. As project managers, RDH actively manages the construction process from initial design to project completion.<br>
<br>
In addition to typical administrative functions, RDH can arrange permits, deal with hazardous materials, liaise with WorkSafe BC or OSHA , and proactively work to keep contractors on-schedule and on-budget. As project managers, RDH provides clients with regular cost reporting, cost forecasts, scheduling updates, and an elevated level of client support.<br>
<br>
Construction Management<br>
<br>
On projects that are large, complex, and challenging—or simply require innovative solutions—RDH is often retained to act as construction manager. In addition to conventional administrative duties, as construction managers RDH takes firm control of all construction-related activities and provides a full-time site superintendent to actively manage the work.<br>
<br>
This elevated level of service provides control and oversight that just isn’t possible with other approaches. Many of the largest, most high-profile building enclosure rehabilitations in the Pacific Northwest and the Lower Mainland have been managed by RDH’s construction managers. RDH has built a reputation for safely delivering innovative, cost-effective, durable solutions.<br>
<br>
Cost-Estimating<br>
<br>
Of fundamental concern to all clients is “What is this going to cost?” Our clients require well-founded cost estimates to make informed decisions. Since its inception, RDH has directly or indirectly managed the repair, renewal, or rehabilitation of more than 1000 buildings.Each of these buildings is different, and each one contributes to our collective experience and knowledge base.<br>
<br>
As we complete projects, we collect related costing data; and as we plan new projects, we can refer to this in-house costing data to track trends and analyze recent bid results. This allows us to more accurately estimate the probable cost of pending work.<br>

                            Our Maintenance and Planning (MaP) group works with your owner group to plan and develop strategies for the long- and short-term needs of your building – everything from roof maintenance to boiler replacement. As the acronym suggests, our services are designed so that we can provide you with a comprehensive roadMaP for the management of your assets.<br>
<br>
What is MaP?<br>
<br>
Our MaP group works with your strata or HOA to plan and develop strategies for the long- and short-term needs for your building – everything from roof maintenance to boiler replacement. As the acronym suggests, our products are designed so that we can provide you with a comprehensive roadMaP for the management of your assets.<br>
<br>
Our Building Asset Management Software application enables you to evaluate and track your maintenance activities and make informed decisions about how to preserve your assets and keep costs under control. The software provides you with many other helpful tools such as a building contacts list and online document storage capability.<br>
<br>
Reserve Studies / Depreciation Reports<br>
<br>
A reserve study (called a depreciation report in British Columbia) is a long-range financial planning tool. It’s used to identify funding requirements for costs associated with future repair, renewal, and replacement projects. The report establishes where you need to focus resources and is a good place to start developing your roadMAP.<br>
<br>
The first step in the preparing the report is to compile an inventory of all of your building’s assets (roofs, boilers, carpets, etc.). Using the inventory as a foundation, we estimate the remaining life of each asset, forecast the replacement costs in future-year dollars, and display the financial analysis with graphs and cash flow tables.<br>
<br>
Recognizing that a picture speaks a thousand words, we provide a photo library accompanied by related data pertaining to your assets. All of the information is accessible through our propriety online BAM software that allows you to update manage the data yourself. The software tool also empowers you to create your own funding scenarios so you can evaluate different funding levels and find a solution that works specifically for your building.<br>
<br>
Maintenance Plans + Reviews<br>
<br>
Maintenance plans help you keep your building assets (e.g., boilers, pumps, elevators) in good working condition so that they achieve their full-intended service life.<br>
<br>
Where a reserve study (depreciation report) identifies what items you need to spend money on and when you need to spend it, this tool helps you optimize the way you spend your money. Ultimately, we can help you track what work is completed vs. what is outstanding so that you are better able to produce reports and make informed decisions.<br>

Maintenance plans move you further along in the roadMAP by helping you answer the following questions:<br>
<br>
How do you keep track of all the drawings, shut-off valves, warranties and service agreements, certificates, and historical events required to efficiently manage your building?<br>
How do you get all of this information in one place so that it is easy to reference?<br>
How long will your building assets last?<br>
What maintenance and renewals work is needed to preserve your assets?<br>
What is the value of the maintenance and renewals work for this year and for the next 30 years?<br>
<br>
Interim Study<br>
<br>
Once a depreciation report (reserve study) or a maintenance plan has been completed, there can be several years between mandatory update studies. An interim study is a cost-effective way to record progress that has been made on your projects (such as a roof renewal or window replacement). This is beneficial if you would like to showcase large projects that have been completed and have the information reflected in an updated report for potential purchasers.<br>
<br>
An interim study does not typically involve a site visit; revisions are made to our existing report based on information provided by you. The content of this study may vary between jurisdictions, please contact the office nearest you to get information relevant to your state or province.<br>

Facility Condition Assessments (FCA)<br>
<br>
A facility condition assessment is a multidisciplinary review of the various building systems for an owner of a portfolio of buildings (municipality, university, school, or hospital) that:<br>
<br>
Determines the condition of the assets (such as roofs and boilers).<br>
Records the extent of deferred maintenance (“catch-up” costs).<br>
Forecasts future life cycle renewal of the assets (“keep-up” costs).<br>
The purpose of the assessment is to prepare a defensible estimate of reinvestment costs so that prudent and informed decisions can be made regarding allocating funds to restore aging assets and to sustain their ongoing performance relative to established goals and standards.<br>
<br>
The FCA provides a benchmark of the current performance of the building and prioritizes items for maintenance, repair, and/or renewal. The data is summarized in a Facility Condition Index (FCI) that provides an objective benchmark against which changes can be monitored over time.<br>
<br>
Our team comprises specialists in the fields of building science, architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical, cost consulting, and construction management. We are very familiar with facility rehabilitation costs, renewal costs, and life cycle audits. Our experience also includes various types of specialized facilities such as swimming pools, ice rinks, community centres, fire stations, and hotels.<br>

                            To make responsible decisions regarding your building, you need to know what its current condition is and understand the cause of any performance problems. RDH will help you gather the right information and guide you in your decision-making process.<br>
<br>
Problem Investigation<br>
<br>
Performance problems can vary widely in scope and severity. For example, they can include:<br>
<br>
Thermal comfort issues (drafts, overheating)<br>
Condensation on walls and windows<br>
The presence of mold<br>
Water entering the interior spaces of a building<br>
Leaky windows or roofs<br>
Premature deterioration of components of the building<br>
To cost-effectively address these types of problems, it’s important to understand the root cause of problems, not just the symptoms. RDH’s advanced building science expertise is the key to focussed investigations and being able to help you undertake the right repairs.<br>
<br>
We use a variety of investigative tools including water penetration test equipment, infrared thermography, moisture meters, and dew point testers.<br>
<br>
Condition Assessment<br>
<br>
We examine all aspects of a building or a building system to determine its existing condition and prognosis for future performance. This snapshot of conditions is a baseline that helps us provide you with advice regarding maintenance activities, repair and renewal recommendations, or the development of a large rehabilitation program. This broad understanding of the current condition and performance means that activities can be planned in the proper sequence, activities can be bundled to be cost-effective, alternate approaches can be identified where appropriate, and opportunities for energy efficiency can be examined with the big picture in mind.<br>
<br>
The condition assessment process typically consists of:<br>
<br>
Reviewing available drawings, reports, or other documentation.<br>
Visually examining building components.<br>
Surveying owners and occupants to identify problematic conditions.<br>
Conducting a moisture probe survey.<br>
Creating exploratory openings.<br>
Using nondestructive testing such as water penetration testing.<br>
At the conclusion of the assessment work, our observations regarding the current condition as well as our recommendations are presented to you and documented in a report that summarizes the information in an easy-to-understand manner, including supportive sketches and photographs.<br>
<br>
Warranty Review<br>
<br>
Our goal in undertaking warranty reviews is to help you resolve issues with the warranty provider in an equitable manner. The escalation of a dispute is in nobody’s best interest and can result in additional costs from simply managing conflict. Warranty reviews are also one of the signals that the responsibility for the long-term in-service performance of the building is being transferred fully to you as owners. RDH is ready to help you assume and plan for this stewardship role at your building.<br>
<br>
The visual review of the building and examination of the construction documents undertaken during a warranty review is a great starting point for us in getting to know your building and its unique character. The warranty review leads quite naturally to the development of a depreciation report/reserve study and maintenance plans.<br>

                            At RDH, we believe every renewal or renovation project should be viewed as an opportunity to cost-effectively implement energy efficiency measures that save you energy and money.<br>
<br>
Energy Saving Opportunities<br>
<br>
Energy efficiency for existing buildings is becoming a priority for many municipalities and more senior levels of government. It is likely that, as buildings are renovated, there will be new requirements for looking at energy efficiency. These new requirements should not be feared, as energy efficiency should be a priority for building owners and managers.<br>
<br>
Every renewal or renovation project can be viewed as an opportunity to cost-effectively implement energy efficiency measures that save you energy and money. At RDH, we understand this changing environment; we frequently provide assistance to jurisdictions as they update their energy requirements. We use this knowledge to help building owners, managers, and operators stay ahead of the curve by:<br>
<br>
Benchmarking: a great starting point is learning how your building or portfolio compares to other buildings.<br>
Looking for energy saving opportunities: energy audits help you understand the systems that consume energy within your buildings and help you identify cost-effective energy savings opportunities.<br>
Using available incentives: government- and utility-sponsored incentives can reduce capital costs and payback periods.<br>
Tying energy into Building Asset Management Services (BAMS): the best time to implement energy saving measures is when planning for the replacement of building assets.<br>
<br>
Benchmarking<br>
<br>
Benchmarking is a low-cost way to compare the energy performance of your building with a database of similar buildings. This comparison identifies underperforming buildings as well as superior performance and provides a tool for tracking and comparing energy consumption from year to year.<br>
<br>
A recent study by ENERGY STAR indicated that on average, buildings that are benchmarked annually use 2.4% less energy than those that aren’t, just because people are more aware of energy performance.<br>
<br>
This can add up. Over 10 years, you’re looking at almost 20% energy savings from when you started!<br>

                            Our goal is to see every building enclosure meet both code compliance and performance expectations. <br>
<br>
Concept Review<br>
<br>
Before detailed decisions are finalized, our clients benefit from a review of the building enclosure design strategies at a conceptual level. This review provides an opportunity to reflect on the basic building science behind the selection of specific assemblies and materials. Experience shows that changes made at the conceptual stage of building envelope design have far less cost impact than those made during construction. A typical Concept Review considers the following:<br>
<br>
 - Environmental loads<br>
 - Energy performance targets and compliance options<br>
 - Life cycle expectations<br>
 - Constructability, sequencing, and complexity of detailing<br>
 - Structural support<br>
<br>
Risk Review<br>
<br>
Not all of RDH’s clients are able to utilize the entire design and construction process to manage risk. There are, however, strategic opportunities during the design and construction process when a focused effort to assess risk and identify mitigating actions can be beneficial to a project stakeholder. RDH has practical methodologies to aid any participant at any stage of the design and construction process. While each client’s needs are unique, the building science and practical approach offered by RDH is consistent with all of our services.<br>
<br>
Construction Document Review<br>
<br>
We focus on the details for our clients. There are many design team members involved in the coordination and correlation of construction drawings. We are typically tasked with reviewing the details for integration of the various building enclosure assemblies. This review also includes the identification of additional details needed to convey the design intent.<br>
<br>
Our clients also look to RDH to review specifications to confirm they are coordinated with drawings and convey appropriate performance requirements. Our goal is construction details that work, are easy to construct, meet best practice standards, and ultimately have less opportunity for unresolved conditions on-site.<br>
<br>
Field Review<br>
<br>
Our field review work provides clients with assurance that construction is conforming to drawings and specifications. The success of any project is dependent on a high level of quality assurance and quality control.<br>
<br>
Our field review personnel contribute to the project team’s quality assurance success by conducting regular and thorough reviews of the building enclosure construction. RDH field review staff are experienced personnel with a track record of successful projects and an interest in working cooperatively in a team environment.<br>
<br>
We communicate our field review work to the project team by documenting and tracking field observations in a project-specific database. Our clients appreciate that we use digital photographs to illustrate deficiencies and recommended actions whenever possible. Project team members also utilize the database because it allows outstanding action items to be tracked and reported at any time.<br>
<br>
Testing<br>
<br>
In addition to regular and through field review of construction, we also regularly perform various on-site tests in our quality assurance role, including:<br>
<br>
 - Water penetration testing of glazing assemblies.<br>
 - Adhesion testing.<br>
 - Membrane thickness testing.<br>
 - Whole-building and assembly air leakage testing.<br>
 - Thermographic scanning and ultrasonic testing if required to help confirm the performance of new assemblies.<br>

RDH can analyze and provide an evaluation into the long-term behavior of any building enclosure assembly or detail for thermal and hygrothermal performance (heat, air, and moisture control).<br>
<br>
Utilizing state-of-the-art software (WUFI Pro 5.0, HEAT 3, THERM), thermal and hygrothermal simulations are used at various stages through the life cycle of a building for different purposes. Thermal modeling software is used to analyze one-, two-, and three-dimensional heat transfer under both steady-state and transient conditions.<br>
<br>
The majority of RDH technical staff have formal training in building science, including several staff members who hold master’s degrees with specializations in building science. This training is imperative to understanding coupled heat and moisture transfer and in successfully utilizing and interpreting the results output from analysis software.<br>

Because of our advanced building science understanding and depth of experience in the use of various building science software packages, we are able to provide training on those packages and on utilizing the results. Several RDH staff members regularly apply this knowledge in the instruction of students at universities and colleges on the west coast.<br>

Hygrothermal Modeling<br>
<br>
Hygrothermal modeling is the computer-assisted simulation of heat, air, and moisture flow through building enclosure assemblies (walls, roofs, floors, below-grade). It is the process of simulating the performance of assemblies so that the future durability and risk associated with different assembly designs, materials, and climate or exposure can be evaluated and assessed. For example, the risk for condensation within an assembly can be analyzed with different insulation or vapor retarder properties, or the influence of driving rain on cladding degradation can be predicted. The hygrothermal model results include temperature, humidity, and moisture content data at materials and at interfaces throughout the assembly. With this data, the user can assess the risk of condensation, moisture entrapment, fungal growth, and even material degradation.<br>
<br>
Thermal Modeling<br>
<br>
Thermal modeling is essential for establishing overall thermal performance values (R-values/U-values) and condensation potential. These tools are used to:<br>
<br>
 - Evaluate the performance of proposed roof, wall, and glazed assembly designs.<br>
 - Help design more thermally efficient and durable details.<br>
 - Provide insight on forensic analysis.<br>
 - Support energy code compliance documentation (i.e., ASHRAE 90.1) or energy credits for LEED projects.<br>

                            We take daring and ambitious architectural designs and develop innovative solutions that achieve performance requirements within challenging constraints.<br>
<br>
Manage Cost<br>
<br>
Curtain wall is often one of the largest contracts on a new construction project.  At RDH, we have an intimate knowledge of the design and construction features of most curtain wall systems on the market today. We have extensive experience with both North American and overseas products and supply chains. With this knowledge we can optimize the design to provide better value and improve performance, often for little or no additional cost.<br>
<br>
Avoid Failures<br>
<br>
Curtain wall and façade glazing systems are among the most complicated elements of a building’s enclosure, and are one of the most common post-construction claims. Early expert involvement that continues through the design and construction phases to the performance verification stages of commissioning can avoid post-construction deficiencies. Our proactive approach and extensive experience in investigating and repairing failures help us to quickly identify high risk areas and resolve issues before they become problems.<br>
<br>
Expert Design and System Analysis<br>
<br>
The curtain wall industry changes rapidly. New systems are constantly being brought to market, often without adequate due diligence or performance and durability testing.  New products and systems require careful evaluation prior to use in the real world.  Our background in curtain wall consulting on new projects, forensic investigations, and research and development of new glazing systems gives us the experience to realistically evaluate new systems. It also gives us the experience to design and implement additional test methods when required.<br>
<br>
Optimize Energy Performance<br>
<br>
Improved energy performance is the new frontier for glazed building enclosures. RDH has the resources to simulate, model, and optimize fenestration systems and anchorage and interface details to achieve the energy performance requirements for the most demanding design briefs.<br>
<br>
Design Drawings and Specifications<br>
<br>
Extensive experience with the design and testing of curtain wall systems allows us to quickly and efficiently review drawings, specifications and submittals to manage risk, optimize the system design, and ensure that performance parameters are not compromised through poor detailing.<br>
<br>
RDH also provides complete curtainwall design drawings and specifications for architectural teams wishing to outsource this component of the design.<br>
<br>
Product Testing and Field Review<br>
<br>
Independent lab testing under RDH supervision confirms the “as-built” performance of fenestration systems. Job site mock-up testing ensures that trades understand and can replicate the complex interfaces between fenestration products and the assemblies in which they are installed.<br>
<br>
During construction our experienced field personnel confirm that installed products and their interfaces to surrounding construction perform as designed, through a combination of field review and field testing.<br>
<br>
Performance Verification and Maintenance<br>
<br>
At the end of the project it is essential to confirm performance and hand over the glazing systems with adequate operations and maintenance guidance. RDH undertakes the performance verification testing and provides comprehensive guidance on maintenance and renewals.<br>

<br>
About Airtightness Testing<br>
Measuring and identifying air leakage in buildings is something that RDH staff members have been doing since our firm was founded and before “commissioning” was an industry term of art. Our staff members are some of the most experienced and knowledgeable in the industry as it relates to air barrier design and testing, including performing dozens of whole-building air leakage tests.<br>
<br>
We are active on the Air Barrier Association of America committee on air leakage testing, and our staff provided input on the Army Corps of Engineers Whole-Building Air Leakage Testing Protocol. We are often consulted by code officials and those who write air leakage testing standards for input. We were part of the team that developed the pressure-neutralized approach for incrementally testing portions of buildings. RDH is more than just another testing agency–our staff members have performed cutting-edge research on air leakage and understand how buildings and the air barrier are put together. This is what sets us apart.<br>
<br>
We specialize in:<br>
<br>
 - Whole-Building Air Leakage Testing<br>
 - Smoke Testing<br>
 - Thermography<br>

                            We can help with early-stage analysis, whole-building energy modeling, and energy code compliance.<br>
<br>
Early-Stage Modeling<br>
<br>
Our early-stage energy analysis occurs at the pre-schematic stage of design where we talk to you about:<br>
<br>
 - The overall enclosure R-value.<br>
 - Building massing and orientation.<br>
 - Basic assembly and fenestration arrangements and details.<br>
<br>
Our services for this optimization role can be handled as a small consulting package independent of any possible role as an energy modeler or building enclosure consultant at the schematic design (SD), design development (DD), construction documents (CD), and construction stages.<br>
<br>
Whole-Building Energy Modeling<br>
<br>
Whole-building energy modeling during DD, CD, and construction is a natural transition from the early-stage analysis we can provide for your project. This continues to optimize the building enclosure for energy performance while considering other building performance parameters such as the mechanical and electrical systems.<br>
<br>
Building Energy Code Compliance<br>
<br>
As local jursidictions and municipalities increase their energy efficiency requirements, we can help provide an understanding of how to get projects to be code compliant, particularly with respect to the building enclosure.<br>
<br>
This can include:<br>
<br>
 - ASHRAE 90.1 compliance to BCBC, City of Vancouver, or other code requirements.<br>
 - Thermal analysis, including R-value calculations for all building details.<br>
 - Assistance completing submission documentation where required by jurisdictions.<br>

                            RDH is committed to working with claims adjusters from all corners of the industry to ensure that the technical support required to adjust the claim is available in a timely and efficient manner.<br>
<br>
Warranty Claims Support<br>
<br>
Latent defect, labour and material, water ingress, and structural defect are some of the construction warranties available in the industry. All warranties result in claims. The initial identification of potential claims, documentation of existing and deteriorated performance, field testing, second opinion review, causation reporting, mediation, litigation support, and construction management or claim resolution measures, represent the range of services that RDH offers as part of the firm’s comprehensive warranty claim support services.<br>
<br>
It doesn’t matter if RDH has been retained by an owner, developer, supplier or a representative of the insurance industry: our goal is to define the problem and provide reasonable, cost-effective, and timely solutions.<br>
<br>
Property Insurance Claims Support<br>
<br>
Almost every significant property is protected by a comprehensive insurance policy. The building enclosure comprises well over half the replacement value of most structures, and contents rely on the building enclosure for protection against the elements. It is easy to see why enclosure consultants are of value to a property claims adjuster.<br>
<br>
Insured perils and exclusions may seem straightforward at first, but often expert and technical review is needed to address specific issues critical to the final determination of coverage. Even after coverage is established, RDH can address extent of damage and the methods and limits of repair or assist in subrogation and cost recovery efforts.<br>
<br>
Working closely with claims adjusters and specialist restoration contractors RDH has supported the resolution of property claims ranging from small residential matters to multimillion dollar loses.<br>
<br>
Surety Claims Support<br>
<br>
When contractors face solvency problems, performance bonds are often the first course of action to achieve project completion. Even when projects are completed, there can be problems whose various parties will look to performance bonds as a means of resolution.<br>
<br>
Claims adjusters and loss control specialists rely on RDH’s project and construction management expertise as well as our technical knowledge to address a wide range of  surety claims.<br>
<br>
RDH has the ability to step into the existing construction and project management contracts to assess completion costs and complete projects. We also offer the technical expertise to resolve claims related to faulty materials, improper installations, faulty construction, or design defects.<br>

                            We assist building product manufacturers and industry organizations with product research, development, testing, and performance monitoring.<br>
<br>
Product R&amp;D<br>
<br>
We have the depth of expertise to address all aspects of the building enclosure in detail. This means understanding of the behaviour of assemblies, components, and materials as well as the construction and design issues that will impact performance. We are known for our practical construction advice, advanced building science knowledge, and specialized analysis capabilities for building materials and assemblies.<br>
<br>
We have in-house laboratory testing facilities, a climate chamber, various building monitoring sites, and a full-scale test wall facility. Recent uses for the test wall facility include testing of window installation procedures, ICF wall systems and details, and various log wall assemblies and details.<br>
<br>
Building Monitoring + Diagnostic Testing<br>
<br>
Building performance monitoring consists of installing sensors and equipment to measure various indicators such as temperature, relative humidity, air quality levels, moisture levels, pressure differences, energy consumption, air flows, etc., over a period of time. These measured performance indicators allow us to better understand and solve problems within buildings, research new building products, and help make buildings perform better. We often use monitoring to diagnose problems such as intermittent leaks, condensation, moisture damage, structural movement, air quality problems, energy use, etc., and to confirm acceptable long-term performance of new building enclosure assemblies and details.<br>
<br>
In conjunction with building monitoring, we regularly perform testing of buildings to measure:<br>
<br>
 - Airtightness and air leakage using specialized fan-door equipment, theatrical smoke, and infrared imaging.<br>
 - Water penetration using calibrated spray racks and apparatuses.<br>
 - Indoor environmental conditions using various sensors.<br>
<br>
Although testing agencies can conduct testing, we find that our knowledge of the building enclosure systems and details allows us to better use the testing to determine the source of failures and provide quick feedback and resolution to effectively address any problems. In addition, as trial repairs are undertaken, the availability of our own test apparatuses allows us to quickly verify the effectiveness of the repairs.<br>

                            We are regularly called upon to assess why assemblies and components of the building enclosure fail.<br>
<br>
Forensic Investigation<br>
<br>
Whether the failure is condensation in walls or on windows, premature fogging of insulating glass units, the leakage of window or curtain wall assemblies, or the failure of an assembly as a roofing membrane or cladding material, RDH has the experience and knowledge to find the root of the problem. We use a variety of investigative techniques.<br>
<br>
Our ability to communicate complex technical issues is one of our greatest strengths.   This ability to communicate stems from a comprehensive understanding of the technical issues – real world design and construction experience, building science expertise, and a scientific approach to our forensic work.  We understand issues at a distinctly advanced level – a result of our specialized building science training and degrees held by many of our staff – and this allows us to be creative with solutions.<br>
<br>
Figuring out the problem is certainly important, but it’s only the first step.  Our ability to articulate a fundamental understanding of what went wrong and what to do about it through clear reports, excellent support graphics, and presentations is the key to helping you understand the issues and what should be done to address performance problems – this is what sets us apart.<br>
