The process:<br>
<br>
 You deliver, or courier, your media to our closest location.<br>
 Our engineers perform their diagnostics; usually within 24 hours.<br>
 You are provided a quote, so you know thel cost to recover your data before we proceed. <br>
 You approve the quote and we start working on the media. If the quote is not approved, we return your media without charge.<br>
 We recover your files (usually within 2-4 days) and send them back to you on CDs, a new drive, or upload the data to our secure ftp server so you can download your files immediately.<br>
 We store your recovered files for 5 days or until we receive confirmation that you were able to verify your data. Once you confirm a successful recovery, we permanently erase your data from our storage area.<br>
<br>
Capital Data Recovery Inc. will sign non-disclosure agreements with any customer.<br>
<br>
No hidden charges! Our billing department works closely with our engineers throughout the entire cost estimation process of your project. If for some reason our engineers are unable to recover your information, you will not be charged. If the job is an easy fix  you will not be charged at all.<br>
<br>
We offer three service levels:<br>
 Emergency (24-48 hours)<br>
 Standard (2-4 days)<br>
 Regular &quot;economy service&quot; (7-10 business days)<br>

Online Education Organization. Ottawa.<br>
Sometimes the impossible is possible, and Capital Data Recovery Ottawa proved this by restoring 100% of our data, which we feared had been lost for ever. Capital Data Recovery successfully recovered all data from a failed 4 drive RAID 5 array, of which: One drive was physically missing, 2 drives were completely failed, and the third drive was 70% failed. To make matters even more impressive, the recovery was performed over Christmas, proving to us the dedication to their work and customers is truly world class. We highly recommend Capital Data Recovery for all your emergency data recovery needs.<br>
<br>
Health Canada. Ottawa.<br>
Capital Data Recovery team provided excellent and professional service in retrieving sensitive data that was urgently needed. He delivered the recovered data ahead of what was scheduled. Capital Data Recovery met and discussed the nature of the problem and offered clear insight into what steps were taken and how they recovered the data, and assisted in ideas on how to prevent such errors in happening again. They courteous and professional expertise are highly recommended. On behalf of Health Canada, thank you for your assistance.<br>

Government Employee. Ottawa.<br>
I appreciated your professional approach and explaining matters to me in language I could understand. My computer is much faster with the new hard drive, and I am pleased with it and the clean-up you did on my computer. Thanks for &quot;going the extra mile&quot;. You did a great job.<br>
<br>
Family data. Gatineau.<br>
Many many many thanks for a 100% recovery of my crashed hard-drive including over 2 years of family pictures of our 2 young children. After taking the drive to a recommended and very reputable data recovery company and after a few weeks having them indicate that &quot;all was lost&quot; I turned to you for a second opinion. Even though I indicated there wasn&#39;t an urgency, you worked on the drive from the moment I left it with you and within 2 days you had recovered 100% of the data. Thank you for your perseverance and expertise, I will recommend you if someone suffers the same bad luck. Thanks again you are a savior.<br>
<br>
Medium size business. Winnipeg.<br>
Capital Data Recovery did an excellent job of recovering data off our raid hard drives. Backups were not current, and it was looking like this company would very well not survive the loss.<br>
This will get the company up and able to invoice again. Also, we will now get a proper disaster recovery plan in place for them.<br>
Considering the alternative, this is a very inexpensive service to use and I would recommend it to anyone with mission critical data that appears to be lost.<br>
<br>
Small business. Ottawa.<br>
The excellent service that I received from Capital Data Recovery allowed me to acquire my most valuable pictures that were stored on my defective drive. All their staff is very friendly and took our concerns very seriously. It is with all my trust that I am recommending their services to everyone I know who needs data recovery.<br>
<br>
Personal files. Toronto.<br>
It is quite apparent that you are first class, and it&#39;s a pleasure to deal with you. I wish everyone I deal with is as honest as you are.<br>
You truly are an amazing Data Recovery Company, and I hope all potential customers know this!<br>

Thanks to the quick and professional service provided by Capital Data Recovery, what could have been a disastrous hardware failure was merely a setback. I quickly received current files so I could continue my work, and the rest of my archives followed later, which enabled me to restore my files. I highly recommend Capital Data Recovery.<br>

Software Development Company. Kanata.<br>
I would like to thank the staff of Capital Data Recovery. Being of professional software developer I felt much embarrassment to experience a hard drive failure without a backup. And with months of work on the drive I was also very worried. Dealing with Capital Data Recovery was a pleasant experience. I found them to be knowledgeable and efficient. They were able to save all my data and restore it to another hard drive, so I was up and running again as soon as I put the new drive into my laptop. This kept downtime to a minimum with no lost data. Thank you Capital Data Recovery.<br>

PC Shop. Cornwall.<br>
Thanks Capital Data Recovery Ottawa for the hard drive recovery! The church is very pleased with the quick turn around and service provided. Not only were you able to get the critical database files, but you went the extra mile and recovered other important folders/documents you thought we would need and indeed we did! Were very thankful and God Bless you!<br>

IT consulting company. Calgary.<br>
I&#39;ve received the DVD today. Everything looks good. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to use your services in the past as well. I&#39;m very much impressed with the quality of the service, timeliness and hassle-free commitment. You&#39;re my first choice for any kind of data recovery. Please keep up the good work.<br>
<br>
Public Works. Government employee. Ottawa.<br>
I&#39;d not been as diligent as I should be backing up to the network, and then my hard drive crashed. Capital Data Recovery was able to recover 3 months worth of work for the price of 3 days worth of work---all done in 48 hours.<br>
<br>
Univesity of Ottawa. Student. Ottawa.<br>
Thank you again for your help. I am very pleased with what you were able to recover for me. Being a student and a newlywed, there was a lot on the hard drive that was important to us. You were very patient, informative, understanding, and kept me at ease throughout the whole process. I hope that this never happens again, but I know I will call you if it does, and I will recommend Capital Data Recovery to anyone that has this happen to them.<br>
I honestly cannot thank you enough.<br>

Dental office: Montreal.<br>
You guys rock! There is nothing else comes to mind. Superb customer service! You work with heart! Friday morning our computer stopped working and we called an IT consultant. He diagnosed the hard drive failure stating that there was something mechanical and the disk needs to be sent for data recovery. Friday night the drive was sent to Capital Data Recovery Saturday delivery. These guys worked over the weekend and overnight to get our data back to us. Monday morning we had all the data back. By 12 p.m. we were up and running! The hard drive was sent to us by bus courier that goes Ottawa-Montreal, as no other courier would work on Sunday. This is amazing! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!<br>

(Wedding pictures before giving to the client)<br>
I would like to formally thank you and your staff for your efforts over the last two weeks. Despite my impression that my data would be unrecoverable, your undying faith that everything could be recovered paid off in the end.<br>
Thanks for you persistence, your daily updates and 100% data recovery rate!<br>
<br>
Family: Calgary.<br>
Thank you for the excellent service! You have recovered 7 years of pictures and videos of our kids and family. We sent our hard disk to local company and were told that nothing could be restored due to some mechanical damages. We decided to try our luck again and sent the disk to Capital Data Recovery. We know what your team had to go through to get our pictures and videos back to us, and we are grateful to you for not giving up and being with us till the end! Your attitude is above belief! Your kindness and willingness to help is unbelievable. You take job personally! You feel it and understand the client! I can go on and on. I will definitely recommend anyone who would ever need your services.<br>

Independent IT Consultant. USA, Texas.<br>
I wanted to take a moment to say thank you for the fantastic service and support. I have worked with many companies over the years. Your customer service and support is above the rest. I am pleased to say I would definitely continue to use you guys in the future. There is no level to the type of support Capital Data Recovery provides. If you have a question or need support you can call or e-mail them at anytime, no matter what king of problem it is. The Capital Data Recovery team goes above and beyond the call of duty. Everything is recovered! Great job! Very kind people! THANK YOU!<br>

IT support team. University. Quebec.<br>
We had a RAID 5 Exchange Server failed on us. Unfortunately, the last backup was 8 days old. I called Capital Data Recovery and felt I was talking to professionals who really know what they are doing. It was an emergency. Hundreds of employees had to be up and running by Monday morning. We sent the hard disks to Capital Data Recovery who worked over the weekend and kept me informed all the time. These people did everything to help us get our files. Everything was recovered 100% but we couldn&#39;t get our files back because no courier would work on Sunday. We downloaded Exchange files from Capital&#39;s FTP. That was the most critical data we needed. The rest of the files were shipped to use overnight on Monday. No employee noticed a problem when they came to work on Monday. Everything was running the way it was before. We, technical people know what it takes when such disaster occurs. My satisfaction with Capital Data Recovery is 110%.<br>
<br>
Special Education Teacher. School. Cornwall.<br>
I just wanted to send an email to you to thank you for your recent kindness and generosity. After my father spent hours video taping my best friends wedding he accidentally deleted the file containing this &#39;unretrievable memory&#39;. Until, by a strike of luck, my father found your organization in the Yellow Pages.<br>
Initially, the cost to recover the data was estimated to be in the thousands! However, from my understanding you understood our circumstances and offered to recover the wedding video free of charge. This gesture has been an overwhelming and generous service that will allow us to enjoy our &quot;recovered&quot; video for many years to come.<br>
A wedding is a special day that only occurs once in a life time and it would be devastating not to have this on video. On behalf of myself, my family and my friends I would like to thank you for your kindness and generosity. We will truly cherish this miracle video forever! Thanks again!!!<br>

Wedding Video. Bride Herself. Ottawa.<br>
My name is Nancy and Chris did a video of my wedding (August 19). It was such a beautiful day and a wonderful memory. A perfect day.<br>
Chris did such a great job, he didn&#39;t miss a moment. He was so disappointed when some data was lost but he never gave up and I know he put a lot of work in behind the scenes. He spoke very highly of you and your efforts in retrieving our wedding video. I was estatic to hear that it was actually possible. I want to express my deepest appreciation in your efforts and professional abilities. You made something that was lost to us and only left in memory become found. We watched the video with family and friends and many were enlightened and thankful to have this sentiment.<br>
Thank you so much for retrieving or beautiful memory that we can now have friends and family who could not make the wedding witness and my husband and I can revisit as well.<br>
<br>
Family Pictures. Gatineau.<br>
Great thanks for the rapid recovery of family&#39;s vacation photos. I was very impressed by the professionalism and the quality of the service delivered. They understand the importance of your loss. For me there is only one data recovery company and it&#39;s Capital Data Recovery Inc. Highly recommended.<br>
<br>
Family Pictures. Ottawa.<br>
Lost and recovered memoirs. Kanata. Capital Data Recovery was able to salvage all of the data off our hard drive, which had a mechanical failure (it was vibrating and humming). Their service was skillful, fast and professional. Thank you! I would highly recommend them for your data recovery needs!<br>
<br>
Family. Mississauga.<br>
I would like to thank the Tech under your employ by the name of Karen. He was most professional, helpful, patient, informative and went way above and beyond the call of duty showing a concern for my questions even though he was busy with another matter.<br>
<br>
Family. Calgary.<br>
Got the pictures you recovered for me today. I thought your service was fast and excellent. Our story , I am sure is like many, priceless pictures from our time with family in Australia , only to discover they were gone. Tried two different camera shops , one finally gave us your name as a last resort. It worked. Thanks so much for saving a big part of out holiday.<br>

Canadian Heritage. Gatineau.<br>
An immense thank you to Capital Data Recovery for their amazing work! Prior to finding Capital Data Recovery, I had a couple of other companies take a look at my hard drive only to find that it could not be recovered - all my data was lost. I am so grateful to Capital Data Recovery for proving them all wrong! Your professionalism, expertise, fast turn around and fair charge will be remembered - and I will continue to recommend you to all my colleagues and friends.<br>
Thanks again!<br>

My laptop hard drive had failed, and Dell sent me a replacement. I needed to get my data recovered, and Capital Data Recovery did a great job! I didn&#39;t lose any files, they were ready sooner than expected and they gave me good service at a reasonable price as well as suggestions regarding the best kind of hard drive to use for backup. I highly recommend Capital Data Recovery to anyone who finds themselves in need of data recovery!<br>

I wanted to thank you for your great work in recovering all the data from my failed laptop hard drive. As owner of a small e-commerce business, my computer is my most important asset: you saved many months worth of work in just a couple of days. I certainly agree with your other customers that the support you provide is unmatched, as is the maturity you bring to the job. Your cordiality at any time of day was also most appreciated. I will definitely tell my friends about your company.<br>

On February 19th 2007, we experienced the stress and insecurity of a hard drive failure.<br>
I called on several occasions to discuss our problem and get a professional opinion on this recuperation process. Every time, the service rendered was amazing.<br>
As soon as I got in the office, both employees made me feel comfortable. They took the required time to explain exactly what was involved in all processes they would do to recuperate the lost data. They evaluated the probabilities of getting the information back from the damage hard drive.<br>
At no time did Capital Data Recovery&#39;s interest come before mine. The dedication to their work and customers is amazing. CDR was clear all along about the risk factors, and the costs associated with this process.<br>
I decided not to recuperate the data since our back up system did the job. Even in this situation CDR provided a letter, for audit purposes, confirming that the drive was not recoverable due to mechanical damage. Total bill amount $0.<br>
The total experience was one you expect from a professional firm. Good expertise and customer care. They observe their business policies. No surprises, no hidden costs. Capital data Recovery help me make a sound decision.<br>
I highly recommend Capital Data Recovery for all your emergency data recovery needs. Keep on doing it.

I would like to thank the staff of Capital Data Recovery. Being of professional software developer I felt much embarrassment to experience a hard drive failure without a backup. And with months of work on the drive I was also very worried. Dealing with Capital Data Recovery was a pleasant experience. I found them to be knowledgeable and efficient. They were able to save all my data and restore it to another harddrive, so I was up and running again as soon as I put the new drive into my laptop. This kept downtime to a minimum with no lost data. Thank you Capital Data Recovery.<br>

I&#39;d not been as diligent as I should be backing up to the network, and then my hard drive crashed. Capital Data Recovery was able to recover 3 months worth of work for the price of 3 days worth of work---all done in 48 hours.<br>

Thank you again for your help. I am very pleased with what you were able to recover for me. Being a student and a newlywed, there was a lot on the hard drive that was important to us. You were very patient, informative, understanding, and kept me at ease throughout the whole process. I hope that this never happens again, but I know I will call you if it does, and I will recommend Capital Data Recovery to anyone that has this happen to them. <br>

You guys rock! There is nothing else comes to mind. Superb customer service! You work with heart! Friday morning our computer stopped working and we called an IT consultant. He diagnosed the hard drive failure stating that there was something mechanical and the disk needs to be sent for data recovery. Friday night the drive was sent to Capital Data Recovery Saturday delivery. These guys worked over the weekend and overnight to get our data back to us. Monday morning we had all the data back. By 12 p.m. we were up and running! The hard drive was sent to us by bus-currier that goes Ottawa-Montreal, as no other currier would work on Sunday. This is amazing! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!<br>

I would like to formally thank you and your staff for your efforts over the last two weeks. Despite my impression that my data would be unrecoverable, your undying faith that everything could be recovered paid off in the end.<br>

Thank you for the excellent service! You have recovered 7 years of pictures and videos of our kids and family. We sent our hard disk to local company and were told that nothing could be restored due to some mechanical damages. We decided to try our luck again and sent the disk to Capital Data Recovery. We know what your team had to go through to get our pictures and videos back to us, and we are grateful to you for not giving up and being with us till the end! Your attitude is above belief! Your kindness and willingness to help is unbelievable. You take job personally! You feel it and understand the client! I can go on and on. I will definitely recommend anyone who would ever need your services.<br>

We had a RAID 5 Exchange Server failed on us. Unfortunately, the last backup was 8 days old. I called Capital Data Recovery and felt I was talking to professionals who really know what they are doing. It was an emergency. Hundrends of employees had to be up and running by Monday morning. We sent the hard disks to Capital Data Recovery who worked over the weekend and kept me informed all the time. These people did everything to help us get our files. Everything was recovered 100% but we couldn&#39;t get our files back because no currier would work on Sunday. We downloaded Exchange files from Capital&#39;s FTP. That was the most critical data we needed. The rest of the files were shipped to use overnight on Monday. No employee noticed a problem when they came to work on Monday. Everything was running the way it was before. We, technical people know what it takes when such disaster occurs. My satisfaction with Capital Data Recovery is 110%.<br>

 Special Education Teacher. School. Cornwall. Job ID: 06706<br>
I just wanted to send an email to you to thank you for your recent kindness and generosity. After my father spent hours video taping my best friends wedding he accidently deleted the file containing this &#39;unretrievable memory&#39;. Until, by a strike of luck, my father found your organization in the Yellow Pages.<br>
Initially, the cost to recover the data was estimated to be in the thousands! However, from my understanding you understood our circumstances and offered to recover the wedding video free of charge. This gesture has been an overwhelming and generous service that will allow us to enjoy our &quot;recovered&quot; video for many years to come.<br>
A wedding is a special day that only occurs once in a life time and it would be devastating not to have this on video. On behalf of myself, my family and my friends I would like to thank you for your kindness and generosity. We will truly cherish this miracle video forever! Thanks again!!!<br>

 Wedding Video. Bride Herselfl. Ottawa. Job ID: 06706<br>
My name is Nancy and Chris did a video of my wedding (August 19). It was such a beautiful day and a wonderful memory. A perfect day. <br>
Chris did such a great job, he didn&#39;t miss a moment. He was so disappointed when some data was lost but he never gave up and I know he put alot of work in behind the scences. He spoke very highly of you and your efforts in retrieving our wedding video. I was estatic to hear that it was actually possible. I want to express my deepest appreciation in your efforts and professional abilities. You made something that was lost to us and only left in memory become found. We watched the video with family and friends and many were enlightened and thankful to have this sentiment.<br>
Thank you so much for retrieving or beautiful memory that we can now have friends and family who could not make the wedding witness and my husband and I can revisit as well.<br>

The process:<br>
<br>
 You deliver, or courier, your media to our closest location.<br>
 Our engineers perform their diagnostics; usually within 24 hours.<br>
 You are provided a quote, so you know thel cost to recover your data before we proceed. <br>
 You approve the quote and we start working on the media. If the quote is not approved, we return your media without charge.<br>
 We recover your files (usually within 2-4 days) and send them back to you on CDs, a new drive, or upload the data to our secure ftp server so you can download your files immediately.<br>
 We store your recovered files for 5 days or until we receive confirmation that you were able to verify your data. Once you confirm a successful recovery, we permanently erase your data from our storage area.<br>
<br>
Capital Data Recovery Inc. will sign non-disclosure agreements with any customer.<br>
<br>
No hidden charges! Our billing department works closely with our engineers throughout the entire cost estimation process of your project. If for some reason our engineers are unable to recover your information, you will not be charged. If the job is an easy fix  you will not be charged at all.<br>
<br>
We offer three service levels:<br>
 Emergency (24-48 hours)<br>
 Standard (2-4 days)<br>
 Regular &quot;economy service&quot; (7-10 business days)<br>

Sometimes the impossible is possible, and Capital Data Recovery Ottawa proved this by restoring 100% of our data, which we feared had been lost for ever. Capital Data Recovery successfully recovered all data from a failed 4 drive RAID 5 array, of which: One drive was physically missing, 2 drives were completely failed, and the third drive was 70% failed. To make matters even more impressive, the recovery was performed over Christmas, proving to us the dedication to their work and customers is truly world class. We highly recommend Capital Data Recovery for all your emergency data recovery needs.<br>

I appreciated your professional approach and explaining matters to me in language I could understand. My computer is much faster with the new hard drive, and I am pleased with it and the clean-up you did on my computer. Thanks for &quot;going the extra mile&quot;. You did a great job.<br>

Family data. Gatineau.<br>
Many many many thanks for a 100% recovery of my crashed hard-drive including over 2 years of family pictures of our 2 young children. After taking the drive to a recommended and very reputable data recovery company and after a few weeks having them indicate that &quot;all was lost&quot; I turned to you for a second opinion. Even though I indicated there wasn&#39;t an urgency, you worked on the drive from the moment I left it with you and within 2 days you had recovered 100% of the data. Thank you for your perseverance and expertise, I will recommend you if someone suffers the same bad luck. Thanks again you are a savior.<br>

Medium size business. Winnipeg.<br>
Capital Data Recovery did an excellent job of recovering data off our raid hard drives. Backups were not current, and it was looking like this company would very well not survive the loss.<br>
This will get the company up and able to invoice again. Also, we will now get a proper disaster recovery plan in place for them.<br>
Considering the alternative, this is a very inexpensive service to use and I would recommend it to anyone with mission critical data that appears to be lost.<br>
<br>
Small business. Ottawa.<br>
The excellent service that I received from Capital Data Recovery allowed me to acquire my most valuable pictures that were stored on my defective drive. All their staff is very friendly and took our concerns very seriously. It is with all my trust that I am recommending their services to everyone I know who needs data recovery.<br>

Software Development Company. Kanata.<br>
I would like to thank the staff of Capital Data Recovery. Being of professional software developer I felt much embarrassment to experience a hard drive failure without a backup. And with months of work on the drive I was also very worried. Dealing with Capital Data Recovery was a pleasant experience. I found them to be knowledgeable and efficient. They were able to save all my data and restore it to another hard drive, so I was up and running again as soon as I put the new drive into my laptop. This kept downtime to a minimum with no lost data. Thank you Capital Data Recovery.<br>

I&#39;d not been as diligent as I should be backing up to the network, and then my hard drive crashed. Capital Data Recovery was able to recover 3 months worth of work for the price of 3 days worth of work---all done in 48 hours.<br>

You guys rock! There is nothing else comes to mind. Superb customer service! You work with heart! Friday morning our computer stopped working and we called an IT consultant. He diagnosed the hard drive failure stating that there was something mechanical and the disk needs to be sent for data recovery. Friday night the drive was sent to Capital Data Recovery Saturday delivery. These guys worked over the weekend and overnight to get our data back to us. Monday morning we had all the data back. By 12 p.m. we were up and running! The hard drive was sent to us by bus courier that goes Ottawa-Montreal, as no other courier would work on Sunday. This is amazing! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!<br>

We know what your team had to go through to get our pictures and videos back to us, and we are grateful to you for not giving up and being with us till the end! Your attitude is above belief! Your kindness and willingness to help is unbelievable. You take job personally! You feel it and understand the client! I can go on and on.

IT support team. University. Quebec.<br>
We had a RAID 5 Exchange Server failed on us. Unfortunately, the last backup was 8 days old. I called Capital Data Recovery and felt I was talking to professionals who really know what they are doing. It was an emergency. Hundreds of employees had to be up and running by Monday morning. We sent the hard disks to Capital Data Recovery who worked over the weekend and kept me informed all the time. These people did everything to help us get our files. Everything was recovered 100% but we couldn&#39;t get our files back because no courier would work on Sunday. We downloaded Exchange files from Capital&#39;s FTP. That was the most critical data we needed. The rest of the files were shipped to use overnight on Monday. No employee noticed a problem when they came to work on Monday. Everything was running the way it was before. We, technical people know what it takes when such disaster occurs. My satisfaction with Capital Data Recovery is 110%.<br>

Special Education Teacher. School. Cornwall.<br>
I just wanted to send an email to you to thank you for your recent kindness and generosity. After my father spent hours video taping my best friends wedding he accidentally deleted the file containing this &#39;unretrievable memory&#39;. Until, by a strike of luck, my father found your organization in the Yellow Pages.<br>
Initially, the cost to recover the data was estimated to be in the thousands! However, from my understanding you understood our circumstances and offered to recover the wedding video free of charge. This gesture has been an overwhelming and generous service that will allow us to enjoy our &quot;recovered&quot; video for many years to come.<br>
A wedding is a special day that only occurs once in a life time and it would be devastating not to have this on video. On behalf of myself, my family and my friends I would like to thank you for your kindness and generosity. We will truly cherish this miracle video forever! Thanks again!!!<br>

My name is Nancy and Chris did a video of my wedding (August 19). It was such a beautiful day and a wonderful memory. A perfect day.<br>
Chris did such a great job, he didn&#39;t miss a moment. He was so disappointed when some data was lost but he never gave up and I know he put a lot of work in behind the scenes. He spoke very highly of you and your efforts in retrieving our wedding video. I was estatic to hear that it was actually possible. I want to express my deepest appreciation in your efforts and professional abilities. You made something that was lost to us and only left in memory become found. We watched the video with family and friends and many were enlightened and thankful to have this sentiment.<br>
Thank you so much for retrieving or beautiful memory that we can now have friends and family who could not make the wedding witness and my husband and I can revisit as well.<br>

An immense thank you to Capital Data Recovery for their amazing work! Prior to finding Capital Data Recovery, I had a couple of other companies take a look at my hard drive only to find that it could not be recovered - all my data was lost. I am so grateful to Capital Data Recovery for proving them all wrong! Your professionalism, expertise, fast turn around and fair charge will be remembered - and I will continue to recommend you to all my colleagues and friends.<br>
Thanks again!<br>

I certainly agree with your other customers that the support you provide is unmatched, as is the maturity you bring to the job. Your cordiality at any time of day was also most appreciated. I will definitely tell my friends about your company.<br>

Hawkesbury Hydro. Hawkesbury.<br>
On February 19th 2007, we experienced the stress and insecurity of a hard drive failure.<br>
I called on several occasions to discuss our problem and get a professional opinion on this recuperation process. Every time, the service rendered was amazing.<br>
As soon as I got in the office, both employees made me feel comfortable. They took the required time to explain exactly what was involved in all processes they would do to recuperate the lost data. They evaluated the probabilities of getting the information back from the damage hard drive.<br>
At no time did Capital Data Recovery&#39;s interest come before mine. The dedication to their work and customers is amazing. CDR was clear all along about the risk factors, and the costs associated with this process.<br>
I decided not to recuperate the data since our back up system did the job. Even in this situation CDR provided a letter, for audit purposes, confirming that the drive was not recoverable due to mechanical damage. Total bill amount $0.<br>
The total experience was one you expect from a professional firm. Good expertise and customer care. They observe their business policies. No surprises, no hidden costs. Capital data Recovery help me make a sound decision.<br>
I highly recommend Capital Data Recovery for all your emergency data recovery needs. Keep on doing it.
