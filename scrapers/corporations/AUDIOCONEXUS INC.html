                            Many of us have experienced the frustration associated with trying to hear and understand our tour guides. Group travelers often challenge their tour guides as they jockey for a position close enough to hear the guides live commentary. Tour guides, communicating with their groups, often have no alternative but to raise their voices to get their message heard.<br>
<br>
Introducing a simple way to provide better tours for your tour groups. ieXplore is an easy-to-use wireless communication system designed specifically for tour groups, factory tours, outdoor excursions, employee training, language interpretation, conferences and trade shows to provide superior tours using wireless technology.<br>
<br>
Your wireless receiver&#39;s multi-channel design enables visitors to select the tour and/or language of their choice. An easy to use language selection switch is located on top of the receiver. The wireless system is suitable for indoor and outdoor use and allows a visitor to move around freely during the entire visit.<br>
Our tour guide system is designed for use by adults and children, by groups or individuals. Our wireless receivers are lightweight and are worn on a belt or around the neck with a lanyard.<br>
<br>
The body-worn wireless Transmitter will broadcast your driver, interpreter or tour guides voice to everyone in their group at a comfortable conversation speech level. The system is wireless and there is no microphone to carry. Guides speak to their entire group as if the group was an arms length away  communicating over distances as far as 80 metres in an open area.<br>
<br>
Excellent for driver led tours on or off the bus, walking tours, tour guide led tours, factory tours, outdoor events, classroom, training, and conferences  ieXplore solves the following problems: background noise, distance; and reverberation.<br>
<br>
ieXplore also comes in a convenient 36-unit portable charger case and a 12-unit charger for smaller group applications. Up to 8 channels can be used simultaneously for multilingual or simultaneous language translation applications. <br>

                            Audio Guides. Automatically. Introducing an affordable audio guide that offers several ways to automatically trigger your audio so visitors get an effortless audio tour experience.<br>
<br>
Our new audio guide comes standard with features like infrared and remote alarm triggering for security, supporting up to 32 languages and topics. Bundled with free content management software, you can easily self-manage your audio guide equipment and audio tours. And best of all, you can set up remote triggers to automatically play audio tour commentary so your visitors get the best possible experience  on every tour.<br>
<br>
Great Audio Tours Are in the Details. A photo display, high fidelity Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technology, offering up to 20 hours of stereo audio playback with a built-in 2GB memory card. And optional larger memory cards for even more audio.<br>
Great sound from a built-in speaker or two earphone jacks available for couples and parents with kids. Backlit display and a raised dot on the number 5 to help people who are visually impaired find their way around the keypad. Lasting up to 12 hours on a single charge, audio guides are new in every way, making everything easier to interact with.<br>
<br>
Developed and designed specifically for on-site audio interpretation of museums, attractions and historic sites, this museum audio guide offers several possibilities for triggering commentary. This includes remote activation of your audio from infrared triggers, RF triggers and RFID (proximity) Tags.<br>
<br>
Changing languages is amazingly simple. Using your audio guide, simply tap a RFID card and Voila! Youre done. Audio guides also include alarm triggering on all devices (with the installation of a wire loop). And a dedicated info button provides visitors with helpful information.<br>
<br>
Audio Guide Chargers. Rack Mountable. 10 unit and 20 unit audio guide chargers are rack mountable and stackable. You can connect up to five 10 unit chargers from one power source  so you can connect and expand audio guide chargers on demand.<br>
Duplicating your data just got easier. No computer required. An optional 20 unit audio guide uploader provides fast mirroring. Load an audio guide and mirror 20 at a time. Change and update your content as often as you want. Just another reason why you can share and do just about everything.<br>

                            AudioConexus offers industry leading script writing services for entertaining and engaging audio tours. We&#39;ve written scripts for GPS audio tours in Canada, the United States, Europe, Southern Asia, and Latin America. We&#39;ve also written for museums, historic sites, and world renowned traveling exhibitions such as Genghis Khan, The Silk Road, Tang, Shipwrecked, and Salvador Dali to name a few. <br>
<br>
Script writing for audio tours is a specialized discipline. How so?<br>
<br>
When we think of writing, we often think of writing for books, magazines, newspapers, blogs, and short stories.  This is generally referred to as creative writing. This style of writing is meant to be read silently  not heard.  Creative writing relies on description to paint the picture of whats going on, or whats important.  Script writing for tours requires less descriptive words, because the audience gets the picture with the additional benefit of professional voice talents and sound designers.  <br>
<br>
Audio tour scripts consist of stories that are designed to be accompanied by music and sound effects. At AudioConexus, we call it: writing for the ear.<br>
<br>
Writing for the ear is different than writing for the minds eye.  The audio tour script is designed to be integrated with music and sound effects, in order to create a moving,  personal experience.<br>
<br>
A good script can mean the difference between a great tour and a tour that falls flat. Writers who have the expertise and the experience know how to tell fun, entertaining, and educational stories that sustain the interest of the audience.  But even the best voice-over talent, music, or sound effects are useless, without a good audio tour script.<br>
<br>
People dont respond well to the mere recitation of facts and figures.  However, they always connect with well-told stories. You can count on a great story to capture the imagination of your audience.<br>

                            Getting foreign language translation right is important for three reasons:<br>
<br>
1.	You cant do literal translations of your English script, or your project will fail.<br>
2.	You need to write for the particular culture of the language. <br>
3.	You need storytellers that translate and adapt  not translators that arent story tellers. <br>
<br>
Why Translation Firms Don&#39;t Work<br>
<br>
When creating audio tours for more than one language, we have a well honed process in place to deliver high-quality tours that are fun and entertaining. <br>
<br>
Foreign language translation is completed using experienced storytellers and professional voice talents. Our foreign language translation methodology requires that two translators work together on every language translation for Quality Assurance. <br>
<br>
During this process, our translators are not doing literal translations of the script. This is because it takes less time to say something in English than in most other languages. Our foreign language storytellers capture the essence of stories, add meaning and context, while taking into consideration audience and cultural sensitivity. <br>
<br>
Writing For Language and Culture<br>
<br>
When we write for language and culture, we avoid things like slang, wordplay and puns. This is because they wont be understood, or worse, may offend. <br>
<br>
Our focus is to make foreign language tours fun and entertaining, easy to understand, clear and familiar.<br>
After our foreign language script translations are done, we then vet our translated scripts through our voice talents. We take this additional step for Quality of Experience.<br>
<br>
Timing is Essential For GPS Tours<br>
<br>
Timing is essential for GPS tours. During our initial on-site visit, a Timing Template is created as a guideline for our writers. <br>
<br>
This timing guideline results from our on-site assessment of high and low traffic scenarios, tidal changes, alternative routes, tour stops, safety, announcements, and discrete ad placements to name a few. <br>
<br>
Our tour commentaries begin and end at the same time (in all languages).<br>
<br>
Storytellers Provide Better Foreign Language Translation<br>
<br>
Since it often takes more time to say the same thing in another language, a literal translation of English will not work. This is because literal foreign language translations of an English script will create audio segments that vary widely in lengths of time. <br>
<br>
When it comes to providing GPS tour entertainment were always thinking about your next point of interest. Thats why we developed a team of foreign language storytellers. Professional storytellers capture the essence of the story being told, in the allotted time. And they tell great stories the way your foreign language guests want to hear them. What this means is, we take culture into consideration during the translation process. What we say in English may not translate well in Japanese, or in fact, may be culturally insensitive. <br>
<br>
When we write foreign language tours, we write for language and culture. <br>

                            Our sound production studios have been recording, editing, and mixing award winning productions in the broadcasting, television, film and animation industries. <br>
<br>
Since 1996, weve also been producing multilingual audio tours for tourisms leading companies. Companies like Merlin Entertainment, the Sands Corporation, and the Dole Plantation. <br>
Weve also worked with many smaller operators who simply want the very best in entertainment for their passengers. <br>
<br>
What weve found though, throughout the years, is that what we do almost seems like magic, behind closed doors, where no one can see us. <br>
<br>
So we wanted to open up our process to you. Drop the veil. Become naked so to speak. Thats why youre invited to our sound production studios any time you like. So you want to join a session? No problem. Just call us and well make the arrangements. <br>
<br>
So why is sound an important factor in the Creative process?<br>
<br>
Its what lifts the sails  and gives your tour life. Our goal, from writing, translation, to sound design and mixing, is to captivate the imaginations of your visitors. <br>
<br>
There are several aspects to making this happen. Here, well discuss a few of them. <br>
<br>
Professional Narration<br>
<br>
When it comes to delivering your tour, its important to work with the pros. Narration is a key component of delivering a great tour  not only do you want great voice(s), you want to get the inflections and tone right. You also want professional recording equipment, with no ambient noise, with crystal clear sound. <br>
During our Creative and Branding process, we provide you with several voice talent samples that we think will fit perfectly into your tour. <br>
<br>
Our pool of male and female voice talents is deep, and were tapping into the greatest resource on the planet  New York, New York. We work with only the best and that means youre getting top notch talent  always. Additionally, we work with voice talents around the globe to address the unique requirements of a project. <br>
<br>
This includes Character Actors, Sound Alikes, and of course  narrators. <br>
<br>
Music For Sound<br>
<br>
We are tapped into the largest music libraries on the planet. If theres a particular style of music youre looking for, we can find it. <br>
<br>
All of our enhanced audio tours include music because it evokes images and emotional responses. Stories and music are key to captivating peoples imaginations. We understand the power of music. And what it means for your tour experiences.<br>
<br>
We spend a lot of time editing and mixing  to get it just right. Thats why we coined the term cinematic audio tour experiences for sightseeing back in 2006. And since then, weve seen some of our competitors jumping on our jargon and using it  which is just fine with us. <br>
<br>
We find it complementary.<br>
<br>
Sound Effects <br>
<br>
Sound effects help us to tell stories. We use sound effects to complete the experience  and to enhance it. There is a long history of sound effects in cinema and in television. <br>
<br>
Can you imagine watching Star Wars without the sound of the lightsaber? Sound effects are used for enhancement or can be created. Used at the right time, theyre vital to the way we tell stories. They can be anything from a creaking door to the sound of a ravens call  which can set the tone and the mood for the experience. <br>
<br>
Were always careful not to overdo it, placing sounds at just the right moment  to bring people to different times and places. <br>

              The EDF Energy London Eye river cruise is delivered with the ebb and flow of the historic river Thames. This made our project more complex because the tides are constantly changing and AudioConexus took the time to coach the London Eye staff on what was required for the scripts, and helped to create the river cruise tours. The GPS tour systems are easy to use and staff and guests are really pleased with the quality of the commentary making the London Eye happy to work with AudioConexus. <br>
<br>
Davey Barrett, Show Services Manager, EDF Energy London Eye<br>
<br>
&quot;We have been using the AudioConexus systems on our seven new double decker buses in Honolulu since April of 2011 and can say without any reservation that it has taken our guest touring experience to the highest levels possible in the state of Hawaii. <br>
<br>
For our staff, the system offers an affordable, easy to use, easy to update system that eliminates the requirement for speaking tour guides on each vehicle while allowing us to provide five different languages simultaneously. The AC team is professional, caring and very supportive.<br>
<br>
For our guests, AudioConexus provides an everyday 24/7 consistent high quality touring experience. Our passengers also have the flexibility to switch to various music channels once they have ridden the bus numerous times. <br>
<br>
For our Waikiki, Honolulu, and China Town communities the AudioConexus commentary system provides a quiet alternative to the noisy blasting PA systems found on other tour vehicles ensuring that noise abatement issues are addressed in each community. This has won not only their respect for our commitment and concern but their active support of our business services.<br>
<br>
For the travel industry this is the very first tour product in Hawaii that Domestic (English speaking), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Chinese travel and activity agents can sell into and across all of their markets that speak any of these multiple languages. <br>
<br>
A TRUE WIN-WIN-WIN-WIN by all accounts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lee Collins, Vice President, Sales and Marketing, AlohaBus<br>
<br>
Our new AudioConexus tour guide system with audio guides is working out great for our customer tours. Our tour guides and tour helpers have high praise for the new system and its ease of use.<br>
<br>
Our administrative assistant loves it, too, because its much easier for her to get everything ready for our tours. Before we purchased the AudioConexus system she had to charge the MP3 players we were using one by one. This system is a huge timesaver for her.<br>
<br>
Most important, our guests are having a much easier time keeping up with our pre-recorded audio because they dont have to fiddle with their own MP3 player to try to find each track by themselves like they used to have to do. Now, the tour guide can control the content for them. Were finding that our guests can also pay more attention to the processes shown on the tour rather than having to try to figure out how to keep up with the MP3s we used before.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve also found that the people in the back of each tour group dont have to worry about missing something that the tour guide says because the tour guide is now speaking to them through microphones that project everything so well, even when theres some background noise from our manufacturing process. The microphones are beneficial for repeating questions asked, too, because the entire group can hear the repeated question and the answer without any shouting needed.<br>
<br>
The exceptional customer service weve received from each and every company representative is another reason that we would recommend AudioConexus. Each person weve worked with has been very helpful along the way of researching, purchasing, and implementing our new system for our busy tour schedule. Recording our new tour script through AudioConexus worked flawlessly and were very happy with how professionally it was done and sounds. Thank you for everything.<br>

                            Many of us have experienced the frustration associated with trying to hear and understand our tour guides. Group travelers often challenge their tour guides as they jockey for a position close enough to hear the guides live commentary. Tour guides, communicating with their groups, often have no alternative but to raise their voices to get their message heard.<br>
<br>
Introducing a simple way to provide better tours for your tour groups. ieXplore is an easy-to-use wireless communication system designed specifically for tour groups, factory tours, outdoor excursions, employee training, language interpretation, conferences and trade shows to provide superior tours using wireless technology.<br>
<br>
Your wireless receiver&#39;s multi-channel design enables visitors to select the tour and/or language of their choice. An easy to use language selection switch is located on top of the receiver. The wireless system is suitable for indoor and outdoor use and allows a visitor to move around freely during the entire visit.<br>
Our tour guide system is designed for use by adults and children, by groups or individuals. Our wireless receivers are lightweight and are worn on a belt or around the neck with a lanyard.<br>
<br>
The body-worn wireless Transmitter will broadcast your driver, interpreter or tour guides voice to everyone in their group at a comfortable conversation speech level. The system is wireless and there is no microphone to carry. Guides speak to their entire group as if the group was an arms length away  communicating over distances as far as 80 metres in an open area.<br>
<br>
Excellent for driver led tours on or off the bus, walking tours, tour guide led tours, factory tours, outdoor events, classroom, training, and conferences  ieXplore solves the following problems: background noise, distance; and reverberation.<br>
<br>
ieXplore also comes in a convenient 36-unit portable charger case and a 12-unit charger for smaller group applications. Up to 8 channels can be used simultaneously for multilingual or simultaneous language translation applications. <br>

                            AudioConexus offers industry leading script writing services for entertaining and engaging audio tours. We&#39;ve written scripts for GPS audio tours in Canada, the United States, Europe, Southern Asia, and Latin America. We&#39;ve also written for museums, historic sites, and world renowned traveling exhibitions such as Genghis Khan, The Silk Road, Tang, Shipwrecked, and Salvador Dali to name a few. <br>
<br>
Script writing for audio tours is a specialized discipline. How so?<br>
<br>
When we think of writing, we often think of writing for books, magazines, newspapers, blogs, and short stories.  This is generally referred to as creative writing. This style of writing is meant to be read silently  not heard.  Creative writing relies on description to paint the picture of whats going on, or whats important.  Script writing for tours requires less descriptive words, because the audience gets the picture with the additional benefit of professional voice talents and sound designers.  <br>
<br>
Audio tour scripts consist of stories that are designed to be accompanied by music and sound effects. At AudioConexus, we call it: writing for the ear.<br>
<br>
Writing for the ear is different than writing for the minds eye.  The audio tour script is designed to be integrated with music and sound effects, in order to create a moving,  personal experience.<br>
<br>
A good script can mean the difference between a great tour and a tour that falls flat. Writers who have the expertise and the experience know how to tell fun, entertaining, and educational stories that sustain the interest of the audience.  But even the best voice-over talent, music, or sound effects are useless, without a good audio tour script.<br>
<br>
People dont respond well to the mere recitation of facts and figures.  However, they always connect with well-told stories. You can count on a great story to capture the imagination of your audience.<br>

                            Getting foreign language translation right is important for three reasons:<br>
<br>
1.	You cant do literal translations of your English script, or your project will fail.<br>
2.	You need to write for the particular culture of the language. <br>
3.	You need storytellers that translate and adapt  not translators that arent story tellers. <br>
<br>
Why Translation Firms Don&#39;t Work<br>
<br>
When creating audio tours for more than one language, we have a well honed process in place to deliver high-quality tours that are fun and entertaining. <br>
<br>
Foreign language translation is completed using experienced storytellers and professional voice talents. Our foreign language translation methodology requires that two translators work together on every language translation for Quality Assurance. <br>
<br>
During this process, our translators are not doing literal translations of the script. This is because it takes less time to say something in English than in most other languages. Our foreign language storytellers capture the essence of stories, add meaning and context, while taking into consideration audience and cultural sensitivity. <br>
<br>
Writing For Language and Culture<br>
<br>
When we write for language and culture, we avoid things like slang, wordplay and puns. This is because they wont be understood, or worse, may offend. <br>
<br>
Our focus is to make foreign language tours fun and entertaining, easy to understand, clear and familiar.<br>
After our foreign language script translations are done, we then vet our translated scripts through our voice talents. We take this additional step for Quality of Experience.<br>
<br>
Timing is Essential For GPS Tours<br>
<br>
Timing is essential for GPS tours. During our initial on-site visit, a Timing Template is created as a guideline for our writers. <br>
<br>
This timing guideline results from our on-site assessment of high and low traffic scenarios, tidal changes, alternative routes, tour stops, safety, announcements, and discrete ad placements to name a few. <br>
<br>
Our tour commentaries begin and end at the same time (in all languages).<br>
<br>
Storytellers Provide Better Foreign Language Translation<br>
<br>
Since it often takes more time to say the same thing in another language, a literal translation of English will not work. This is because literal foreign language translations of an English script will create audio segments that vary widely in lengths of time. <br>
<br>
When it comes to providing GPS tour entertainment were always thinking about your next point of interest. Thats why we developed a team of foreign language storytellers. Professional storytellers capture the essence of the story being told, in the allotted time. And they tell great stories the way your foreign language guests want to hear them. What this means is, we take culture into consideration during the translation process. What we say in English may not translate well in Japanese, or in fact, may be culturally insensitive. <br>
<br>
When we write foreign language tours, we write for language and culture. <br>

                            Our sound production studios have been recording, editing, and mixing award winning productions in the broadcasting, television, film and animation industries. <br>
<br>
Since 1996, weve also been producing multilingual audio tours for tourisms leading companies. Companies like Merlin Entertainment, the Sands Corporation, and the Dole Plantation. <br>
Weve also worked with many smaller operators who simply want the very best in entertainment for their passengers. <br>
<br>
What weve found though, throughout the years, is that what we do almost seems like magic, behind closed doors, where no one can see us. <br>
<br>
So we wanted to open up our process to you. Drop the veil. Become naked so to speak. Thats why youre invited to our sound production studios any time you like. So you want to join a session? No problem. Just call us and well make the arrangements. <br>
<br>
So why is sound an important factor in the Creative process?<br>
<br>
Its what lifts the sails  and gives your tour life. Our goal, from writing, translation, to sound design and mixing, is to captivate the imaginations of your visitors. <br>
<br>
There are several aspects to making this happen. Here, well discuss a few of them. <br>
<br>
Professional Narration<br>
<br>
When it comes to delivering your tour, its important to work with the pros. Narration is a key component of delivering a great tour  not only do you want great voice(s), you want to get the inflections and tone right. You also want professional recording equipment, with no ambient noise, with crystal clear sound. <br>
During our Creative and Branding process, we provide you with several voice talent samples that we think will fit perfectly into your tour. <br>
<br>
Our pool of male and female voice talents is deep, and were tapping into the greatest resource on the planet  New York, New York. We work with only the best and that means youre getting top notch talent  always. Additionally, we work with voice talents around the globe to address the unique requirements of a project. <br>
<br>
This includes Character Actors, Sound Alikes, and of course  narrators. <br>
<br>
Music For Sound<br>
<br>
We are tapped into the largest music libraries on the planet. If theres a particular style of music youre looking for, we can find it. <br>
<br>
All of our enhanced audio tours include music because it evokes images and emotional responses. Stories and music are key to captivating peoples imaginations. We understand the power of music. And what it means for your tour experiences.<br>
<br>
We spend a lot of time editing and mixing  to get it just right. Thats why we coined the term cinematic audio tour experiences for sightseeing back in 2006. And since then, weve seen some of our competitors jumping on our jargon and using it  which is just fine with us. <br>
<br>
We find it complementary.<br>
<br>
Sound Effects <br>
<br>
Sound effects help us to tell stories. We use sound effects to complete the experience  and to enhance it. There is a long history of sound effects in cinema and in television. <br>
<br>
Can you imagine watching Star Wars without the sound of the lightsaber? Sound effects are used for enhancement or can be created. Used at the right time, theyre vital to the way we tell stories. They can be anything from a creaking door to the sound of a ravens call  which can set the tone and the mood for the experience. <br>
<br>
Were always careful not to overdo it, placing sounds at just the right moment  to bring people to different times and places. <br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              The EDF Energy London Eye river cruise is delivered with the ebb and flow of the historic river Thames. This made our project more complex because the tides are constantly changing and AudioConexus took the time to coach the London Eye staff on what was required for the scripts, and helped to create the river cruise tours. The GPS tour systems are easy to use and staff and guests are really pleased with the quality of the commentary making the London Eye happy to work with AudioConexus. <br>
<br>
Davey Barrett, Show Services Manager, EDF Energy London Eye<br>
<br>
&quot;We have been using the AudioConexus systems on our seven new double decker buses in Honolulu since April of 2011 and can say without any reservation that it has taken our guest touring experience to the highest levels possible in the state of Hawaii. <br>
<br>
For our staff, the system offers an affordable, easy to use, easy to update system that eliminates the requirement for speaking tour guides on each vehicle while allowing us to provide five different languages simultaneously. The AC team is professional, caring and very supportive.<br>
<br>
For our guests, AudioConexus provides an everyday 24/7 consistent high quality touring experience. Our passengers also have the flexibility to switch to various music channels once they have ridden the bus numerous times. <br>
<br>
For our Waikiki, Honolulu, and China Town communities the AudioConexus commentary system provides a quiet alternative to the noisy blasting PA systems found on other tour vehicles ensuring that noise abatement issues are addressed in each community. This has won not only their respect for our commitment and concern but their active support of our business services.<br>
<br>
For the travel industry this is the very first tour product in Hawaii that Domestic (English speaking), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Chinese travel and activity agents can sell into and across all of their markets that speak any of these multiple languages. <br>
<br>
A TRUE WIN-WIN-WIN-WIN by all accounts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lee Collins, Vice President, Sales and Marketing, AlohaBus<br>
<br>
Our new AudioConexus tour guide system with audio guides is working out great for our customer tours. Our tour guides and tour helpers have high praise for the new system and its ease of use.<br>
<br>
Our administrative assistant loves it, too, because its much easier for her to get everything ready for our tours. Before we purchased the AudioConexus system she had to charge the MP3 players we were using one by one. This system is a huge timesaver for her.<br>
<br>
Most important, our guests are having a much easier time keeping up with our pre-recorded audio because they dont have to fiddle with their own MP3 player to try to find each track by themselves like they used to have to do. Now, the tour guide can control the content for them. Were finding that our guests can also pay more attention to the processes shown on the tour rather than having to try to figure out how to keep up with the MP3s we used before.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve also found that the people in the back of each tour group dont have to worry about missing something that the tour guide says because the tour guide is now speaking to them through microphones that project everything so well, even when theres some background noise from our manufacturing process. The microphones are beneficial for repeating questions asked, too, because the entire group can hear the repeated question and the answer without any shouting needed.<br>
<br>
The exceptional customer service weve received from each and every company representative is another reason that we would recommend AudioConexus. Each person weve worked with has been very helpful along the way of researching, purchasing, and implementing our new system for our busy tour schedule. Recording our new tour script through AudioConexus worked flawlessly and were very happy with how professionally it was done and sounds. Thank you for everything.<br>
