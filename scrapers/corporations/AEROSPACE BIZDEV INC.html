              Government of Canada&#39;s 2012 Aerospace Review<br>
In 2012, the Aerospace Review was conducted to provide a complete, independent, fiscally neutral, and practical review of all aerospace policies and programs. The goal was to develop a federal policy framework to maximize the competitiveness of exporting and the resulting benefits to Canadians. Linda Wolstencroft participated in two of the six working groups: the Small Business and Supply Chain Development Working Group, and the Procurement Working Group. The expected outcome is to suggest practical recommendations to identified issues for the short, medium, and long term, and to better position the Canadian aerospace industry in the global marketplace.<br>
<br>
Aerospace Industry Association of British Columbia Business Development<br>
The Aerospace Industry Association of British Columbia (AIABC) aimed to develop its new strategy. Work included creating a Business Plan that detailed its current situation and future plans over the next two years in order to increase the associations activities and revisit the value that it will provide to its stakeholders. The business plan has led to the development of three project plans for working with AIABC stakeholders in the development of the aerospace industry in BC.<br>
<br>
International Machine Transport Proposal Development Training and Mentoring<br>
International Machine Transport (IMT) has recently expanded their business and was successful in selling their specialty transport services to a new market segment. To supplement this success and meet the professional standards common to this industry, they required tutoring and mentoring to improve their skillsets and efficiency to produce quality proposals and sales presentations that were suitable for larger, more complex projects. Work involved developing a personalized and customized tutoring and mentorship program. The material worked on was a real proposal that was to be submitted to a US-based firm. The project resulted in the IMT team having an increased ability to develop winning proposals in addition to having a proposal template to work from for higher-tier clients. <br>
