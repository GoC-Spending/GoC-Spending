                            The sight for short-middle distance is the important core component of artillery of various tanks and warships; even under the conditions of modern warfare, its also essential. Various reticles are designed according to the use, the range and the different ballistic trajectory of diversified artillery. Our products have large coverage, wide variety, complicated figures and exquisite technique.  <br>
<br>
The reticles we process, for the high accuracy sniping riflescopes, are superb in numerous of gun sights. For example, MJ2-10 reticle thickness is 8mm, cylinder polished, the figure has a width of 0.26mm aiming circle and four width of 0.014mm ranging lines, its exterior surface needs plate broad-band anti-reflection coating, and its used not only in daytime but also at night. This product cannot be completed by a single photo-etching technology, combination of different techniques, we successfully processed this product. After a number of rigorous testing including high and low temperature (+80Degree Centigrade,-50Degree Centigrade), raining, vibration, and salt atmosphere, the product conforms to all the design requirements. We also provide various precise reticles for such as laser measuring &amp; ranging system and single soldier guidance system.<br>

                            All different kinds of Resolution Plates are important testing methods for geometric optical image evaluation. We can process the pivotal inspecting and testing resolution plates for optical bench and collimator, such as the ZB N35 003-89 and WT 1005-62 standard resolution plate, radial resolution plate, asterism resolution plate for image evaluation, Polo board for focal length testing, etc. The minimum line width of the resolution plate is 1um, and the minimum resolution is 500lines/mm. Based on the current popular demands of digital camera objective lenses and CCD lenses as for image evaluation, we successively developed micro-length resolution plate series, which have been adopted by many related companies.<br>

                            We have accumulated long-term professional working experience and developed our particular techniques, we are able to undertake and process special photoetching components. For example the variable-transmission MTF sinusoidal grating, the variable-frequency OTF optical transfer function grating, etc. In particularly, the novel wavelength gratings which have the wavelengths of Helium and Neon as their raster unit, we overcome the unstable error in laser length measuring, and the accuracy of our products reaches 0.2nm. Also, our products such as germanium crystal and white gem coders, modulators are widely used in infrared guidance and measure &amp; control systems(M&amp;C). Moreover, we can make the pattern on the sphere shape surface; it makes the special structure of the products and special light path design as possible.<br>

            Photoetching technology, which has existed for nearly two centuries, has run to the modern sub-nanometer figure and nanometer precision photoetching from archaic spider line reticle. We persist in traditional techniques, develop modern technology and are devoted to the combination of these two. We have created our particular super-minute figure processing technology after many years of research and exploration.<br>
<br>
We not only have conventional photographic copy technology by using SHELLAC and P.V.A, but also have modern copy technology by using E spectral line photoetching super micro-particle dry plate, G spectral line positive and negative photo-resistant chrome plate and H spectral line positive and negative photo-resistant chrome plate. We not only have etching figure technology by using mechanical chemistry method, but also have precise photo-etching technology by using high precise two-frequency laser orientation electron beam photoetching system. We not only have regular films plating technology by using D450 conventional vacuum coating machine, but also have high precise films plating technology by using magnetron sputtering film formation equipment. We use our own characteristic technology successfully to solve development and production problems of various high difficult photoetching components.<br>
<br>
Substrate materials diversify. From the materials application of conventional optical glass (K9, BaK7), optical quartz glass, single color optical glass (red, green, yellow) and other common spectral carriers to the application of far-UV and far-infrared spectral region materials such as Germanium crystal, white gem, MgF2, and ZnS, it has extended photo-etching components&#39; application field and practical range. Because of the complete technology, after several years effort, the varieties of our products have reached thousands of kinds. Furthermore, we not only can process all kinds of high difficult, specialized photo-etching components but also have the ability to aggressively develop new products and mass production.<br>
Super-micro components (Diameter: 2.8mm), <br>
Super-thin components (Thickness: 0.4mm), <br>
Super-thick components (Thickness: 20mm), <br>
Super-large components (Diameter: 420mm, Area: 15inchX15inch), <br>
High-precision components (Length accuracy: 0.2um, Angle accuracy: 0.2seconds).<br>

                            The sight for short-middle distance is the important core component of artillery of various tanks and warships; even under the conditions of modern warfare, its also essential. Various reticles are designed according to the use, the range and the different ballistic trajectory of diversified artillery. Our products have large coverage, wide variety, complicated figures and exquisite technique.  <br>
<br>
The reticles we process, for the high accuracy sniping riflescopes, are superb in numerous of gun sights. For example, MJ2-10 reticle thickness is 8mm, cylinder polished, the figure has a width of 0.26mm aiming circle and four width of 0.014mm ranging lines, its exterior surface needs plate broad-band anti-reflection coating, and its used not only in daytime but also at night. This product cannot be completed by a single photo-etching technology, combination of different techniques, we successfully processed this product. After a number of rigorous testing including high and low temperature (+80Degree Centigrade,-50Degree Centigrade), raining, vibration, and salt atmosphere, the product conforms to all the design requirements. We also provide various precise reticles for such as laser measuring &amp; ranging system and single soldier guidance system.<br>

                            All different kinds of Resolution Plates are important testing methods for geometric optical image evaluation. We can process the pivotal inspecting and testing resolution plates for optical bench and collimator, such as the ZB N35 003-89 and WT 1005-62 standard resolution plate, radial resolution plate, asterism resolution plate for image evaluation, Polo board for focal length testing, etc. The minimum line width of the resolution plate is 1um, and the minimum resolution is 500lines/mm. Based on the current popular demands of digital camera objective lenses and CCD lenses as for image evaluation, we successively developed micro-length resolution plate series, which have been adopted by many related companies.<br>

                            We have accumulated long-term professional working experience and developed our particular techniques, we are able to undertake and process special photoetching components. For example the variable-transmission MTF sinusoidal grating, the variable-frequency OTF optical transfer function grating, etc. In particularly, the novel wavelength gratings which have the wavelengths of Helium and Neon as their raster unit, we overcome the unstable error in laser length measuring, and the accuracy of our products reaches 0.2nm. Also, our products such as germanium crystal and white gem coders, modulators are widely used in infrared guidance and measure &amp; control systems(M&amp;C). Moreover, we can make the pattern on the sphere shape surface; it makes the special structure of the products and special light path design as possible.<br>

            Photoetching technology, which has existed for nearly two centuries, has run to the modern sub-nanometer figure and nanometer precision photoetching from archaic spider line reticle. We persist in traditional techniques, develop modern technology and are devoted to the combination of these two. We have created our particular super-minute figure processing technology after many years of research and exploration.<br>
<br>
We not only have conventional photographic copy technology by using SHELLAC and P.V.A, but also have modern copy technology by using E spectral line photoetching super micro-particle dry plate, G spectral line positive and negative photo-resistant chrome plate and H spectral line positive and negative photo-resistant chrome plate. We not only have etching figure technology by using mechanical chemistry method, but also have precise photo-etching technology by using high precise two-frequency laser orientation electron beam photoetching system. We not only have regular films plating technology by using D450 conventional vacuum coating machine, but also have high precise films plating technology by using magnetron sputtering film formation equipment. We use our own characteristic technology successfully to solve development and production problems of various high difficult photoetching components.<br>
<br>
Substrate materials diversify. From the materials application of conventional optical glass (K9, BaK7), optical quartz glass, single color optical glass (red, green, yellow) and other common spectral carriers to the application of far-UV and far-infrared spectral region materials such as Germanium crystal, white gem, MgF2, and ZnS, it has extended photo-etching components&#39; application field and practical range. Because of the complete technology, after several years effort, the varieties of our products have reached thousands of kinds. Furthermore, we not only can process all kinds of high difficult, specialized photo-etching components but also have the ability to aggressively develop new products and mass production.<br>
Super-micro components (Diameter: 2.8mm), <br>
Super-thin components (Thickness: 0.4mm), <br>
Super-thick components (Thickness: 20mm), <br>
Super-large components (Diameter: 420mm, Area: 15inchX15inch), <br>
High-precision components (Length accuracy: 0.2um, Angle accuracy: 0.2seconds).<br>
