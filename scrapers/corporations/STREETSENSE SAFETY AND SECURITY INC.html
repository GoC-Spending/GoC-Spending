        <br>            StreetSense was formed in 2007 to provide personal safety and self-defense training for the corporate sector, government, schools, law enforcement, and the public. When I started the company my goal was to provide my clients with the skills and knowledge to reduce their risk of being targeted for crime and violence. While this is still my goal, how I do this has evolved, and expanded astronomically.<br><br>I’ve radically altered my approach to how I teach crime and violence prevention. What I’ve discovered is that the traditional approaches for reducing incidents of criminal activity and violence aren’t working; at least not very well. What’s needed is for training to provide the average person with the ability to recognize, profile, assess and mitigate threats to their safety across all environments.<br><br> As I developed the StreetSense program, I thought a great deal about my work as a correctional officer. Every day I work amongst some of the most violent and unpredictable members of society. Fear, intimidation, and violence are a part of the lexicon of my workplace. Yet surprisingly there are far fewer instances of officers being targeted for violence than you think. This has everything to do with our ability to accurately assess the intentions of those around us, and take proactive action to either de-escalate the situation, or neutralize the threat. It also has a lot to do with how we train to mitigate threats.<br><br>The StreetSense curriculum is designed to provide my customers with these same skill sets, without the need to spend 25 years in prison acquiring them. Intelligence based, StreetSense programs teach clients Proactive Personal Safety (PPS), and how to quickly and accurately profile individuals in their environment and determine if they pose a threat. Learning to identify the pre-incident indicators that are always present prior to crime or violence occurring provides clients with an increased array of response options. Coupled with reality based Aggression Control Tactics (ACT) they are also well prepared to deal with whatever life throws at them.<br><br>I’ve been involved in the combat arts for most of my life. I’ve also been fortunate to have learned from some of the best martial artists in the field. This is a big part of the problem with teaching people how to respond physically to threats to their safety. Most people won’t spend years studying the combat arts. Statistics indicate that only 1/1000 people who begin training reach black belt level. Aggression control tactics training is a solution.<br><br>Simple, effective, and devastating is how clients refer to this program. Training focuses on situational awareness, target hardening and behavioural profiling. It teaches clients how crime and violence actually occur. Training is concept based and designed to provide a full spectrum of response options. We are not going to change the fact that there will always be a segment of the population that sees the rest of us as potential targets for crime and predation. What can change is how you look at the world, and your place in it. You don’t have to live in fear, but you can use it to keep you and your family safe.I am a veteran correctional officer with over twenty five years of experience working in a maximum security facility. I have been involved in the combat arts since 1970 and my training has been both eclectic and practical. I’ve deployed in many capacities during my security career from working as a doorman in some pretty sketchy bars, to teaching hand to hand combat to close protection operatives. <br>Working in an occupation where violence is a regular occurrence has taught me a few things about what does and does not work in situations where violence happens fast, and your life could be on the line. These experiences have had a strong influence on the way I teach and consult for my clients. <br><br>

                            Violence is endemic in our culture. In order to reduce instances of workplace violence you must first acknowledge that you are at risk.Many businesses face the challenges of safely conducting operations in potentially hostile environments. Safety and security are important concepts as your personnel may be exposed to a wide variety of threats and risks during the course of their day to day activities.<br>
<br>
During the past two decades many people have lost their lives, suffered injury, or been exposed to crime, violence and trauma while going about their regular work duties. This highlights the importance of investing in specific training designed to increase employee’s ability to recognize threats to their safety and security, and increase their chances of survival if they are place in harm’s way.<br>
<br>
The business community is often required to deploy employees to varying types of workplaces, and some are higher risk than others. This requires a serious commitment by the organization to address the safety and security of its personnel. In this context workplace violence prevention training is deemed to be a valuable support tool to organizations in regards to their duty of care to their deployed personnel.<br>
<br>
StreetSense Inc. has developed a Workplace Violence Prevention program (WVP) designed specifically to assist organizations in training their personnel to increase their personal safety and security while both within the workplace, and in their private lives.<br>
<br>
Safety and Security are essential to the orderly operations of business regardless of the organizations mandate. Properly training and equipping personnel is part of the duty of care for every organization. This includes all pre-deployment medical and psychiatric screening, workplace violence prevention training, and ensuring a tested and functioning security management framework is in place.<br>
<br>
WVP training is crucial for anyone working in the modern business environment. The curriculum provides comprehensive coverage of the relevant issues and is designed to safely simulate the types of situations employees may encounter. The program stresses proactive security, and teaches participants how to avoid high risk situations, escape and evade, and survive.<br>
<br>
The course utilizes classroom theory, hands on training, and is complemented by simulations of real-life situations such as angry/violent customers, employees, criminality, assaults, and weapons related incidents. After each exercise and simulation experienced trainers will debrief the group on the behaviour of individual participants and of the group as a whole. The aim is the highlighting critical problems and issues that emerge during training and of improving personal and group functionality under difficult conditions.<br>

My background teaching reality based self-defence enhanced by my work as an correctional officer has made me acutely aware of how crime and violence happen in the real world.<br>
<br>
The StreetSense curriculum teaches student&#39;s and faculty the skills to utilize the personal safety triangle (situational awareness, target hardening, and behavioural profiling) to identify the pre-incident indicators that are always present prior to crime and violence occurring. The curriculum is reality based and utilizes a variety of training modalities to ensure participant success. <br>
<br>
I provide training, education and consulting for both the Federal and Provincial government, Universities, Colleges, as well as many private schools and school boards. My eclectic background in security and personal protection has given me a unique opportunity to teach my clients how to utilize Proactive Personal Safety concepts to reduce their risk of being perceived as a potential target for criminals and predators. StreetSense is a contributing author to the National Workplace Violence Prevention Institutes magazine, and I regularly write a column for Law Enforcement Today magazine.<br>

                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              The Graduate Student&#39;s Association of the University of Calgary in collaboration with StreetSense Safety and Security has offered the graduate students self defense courses since 2009.<br>
<br>
In these workshops, students learned the truth about how crimes and violence occur. They were taught how to recognize  the signs of impending violence and how criminals choose and stalk their victims. They also learned simple methods to    reduce risk in their lives and how to lower their profiles as a potential victim. <br>
<br>
From the feedback, we see that these workshops are a huge success. Comments include &quot;Awesome&quot;, &quot;Fantastic&quot;, and &quot;Exceeded my expectations&quot;. The GSA now offers StreetSense Safety courses 4 times per year.<br>

              Kerry,<br>
<br>
On behalf of the management team and officers with CBSA at the Calgary International Airport, I would like to<br>
sincerely thank you for the series of three presentations you did for our team meetings in November. The teams<br>
were very appreciative of all the time and effort you put in to creating and delivering the well-articulated<br>
presentation. You are clearly an expert in your field, and you effectively communicated extremely critical<br>
information regarding the environment we work in.<br>
<br>
You are certainly passionate about your work and as such, gave an effective inside look at the realities of working<br>
amongst significant threats in the law enforcement field. Presenting this realistic view was certainly an eye opening      <br>
experience, and a good reminder for how critical it is to stay vigilant in our line of work. Given the number of gang<br>
affiliates we encounter and the issues that surround them such as drug trafficking and officer safety, hearing you<br>
share your wealth of knowledge was invaluable.<br>
<br>
The officers gave phenomenal feedback specific to your presentation, and still enthusiastically discuss the material you covered. Your presentations are highly relevant to our daily operations, and as uniformed law enforcement officers, reiterating the inherent risk we are at is an essential message. Furthermore, the steps we should be taking to protect ourselves and mitigate these risks were very much appreciated and well-received. I cannot thank you enough for taking time out of your busy day to offer your expertise with the highly comprehensive presentation. Please do stay in touch, and I hope to have you back for future presentations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              The first time I had the fortune of training with Street Sense Safety &amp; Security was early 2010 on a high risk security operators course offered By Modus Concepts of Calgary, Alberta. From the onset of the training provided by Tim and Kerry I could easily see that this was going to be unlike any training in hand to hand combat and self defense that I had received either with the Military or acquired in the private sector. Their instruction was clear, concise and to the point. They were able to take a handful of individuals over a short period of time and teach the basic fundamentals and importance of  unarmed defense against attackers either armed or unarmed. Also important to note is that they advocated that the best defense to an attack is to be able to avoid confrontation altogether. <br>
<br>
As an owner of a private security company I find the need for practical, realistic training is of the utmost importance to operate professionally and effectively. So whether you are new to the private security industry or you are an experienced security officer looking to brush up on your physical defense skills you need look no further than StreetSense Safety &amp; Security. <br>

<br>
Excellent approach, philosophy and self-defense techniques. Great methods of instructing and just the right amount of theory to practical ratio. Appreciated the energy and encouragement.<br>
<br>
Very knowledgeable and professional, well done.<br>
<br>
Excellent! Clear instruction, motivated and dedicated with real-life experience.<br>
<br>
The physical instruction from Kerry and Tim was excellent. The course is a hostile environment program and if I train as I have been taught; then I will fight how I have been taught; whether at home or overseas. As Daniel made clear throughout the course, better to be tried by 12 than carried by 6! Overall, an excellent course. <br>
<br>
Excellent instructional techniques, focused and very approachable.<br>
<br>
Very serious about what they teach due to the nature of their jobs and still managed to keep the course enjoyable; well done.<br>
<br>
Enjoyed the self-defense classes and nice to see (well hear) Kerry getting stuck-in during the resistance to interrogation phase.<br>
<br>
No suggestions keep doing what you are doing, great course, loved the realism and the adrenaline inoculation <br>

                            Violence is endemic in our culture. In order to reduce instances of workplace violence you must first acknowledge that you are at risk.Many businesses face the challenges of safely conducting operations in potentially hostile environments. Safety and security are important concepts as your personnel may be exposed to a wide variety of threats and risks during the course of their day to day activities.<br>
<br>
During the past two decades many people have lost their lives, suffered injury, or been exposed to crime, violence and trauma while going about their regular work duties. This highlights the importance of investing in specific training designed to increase employee’s ability to recognize threats to their safety and security, and increase their chances of survival if they are place in harm’s way.<br>
<br>
The business community is often required to deploy employees to varying types of workplaces, and some are higher risk than others. This requires a serious commitment by the organization to address the safety and security of its personnel. In this context workplace violence prevention training is deemed to be a valuable support tool to organizations in regards to their duty of care to their deployed personnel.<br>
<br>
StreetSense Inc. has developed a Workplace Violence Prevention program (WVP) designed specifically to assist organizations in training their personnel to increase their personal safety and security while both within the workplace, and in their private lives.<br>
<br>
Safety and Security are essential to the orderly operations of business regardless of the organizations mandate. Properly training and equipping personnel is part of the duty of care for every organization. This includes all pre-deployment medical and psychiatric screening, workplace violence prevention training, and ensuring a tested and functioning security management framework is in place.<br>
<br>
WVP training is crucial for anyone working in the modern business environment. The curriculum provides comprehensive coverage of the relevant issues and is designed to safely simulate the types of situations employees may encounter. The program stresses proactive security, and teaches participants how to avoid high risk situations, escape and evade, and survive.<br>
<br>
The course utilizes classroom theory, hands on training, and is complemented by simulations of real-life situations such as angry/violent customers, employees, criminality, assaults, and weapons related incidents. After each exercise and simulation experienced trainers will debrief the group on the behaviour of individual participants and of the group as a whole. The aim is the highlighting critical problems and issues that emerge during training and of improving personal and group functionality under difficult conditions.<br>

                            The StreetSense School Violence Prevention program  teaches students, and faculty how to recognize, profile, assess, and mitigate risk in an educational environment. My background teaching reality based self-defence enhanced by my work as an correctional officer has made me acutely aware of how crime and violence happen in the real world.<br>
<br>
The StreetSense curriculum teaches student&#39;s and faculty the skills to utilize the personal safety triangle (situational awareness, target hardening, and behavioural profiling) to identify the pre-incident indicators that are always present prior to crime and violence occurring. The curriculum is reality based and utilizes a variety of training modalities to ensure participant success. <br>
<br>
I provide training, education and consulting for both the Federal and Provincial government, Universities, Colleges, as well as many private schools and school boards. My eclectic background in security and personal protection has given me a unique opportunity to teach my clients how to utilize Proactive Personal Safety concepts to reduce their risk of being perceived as a potential target for criminals and predators. StreetSense is a contributing author to the National Workplace Violence Prevention Institutes magazine, and I regularly write a column for Law Enforcement Today magazine.<br>

              The Graduate Student&#39;s Association of the University of Calgary in collaboration with StreetSense Safety and Security has offered the graduate students self defense courses since 2009.<br>
<br>
In these workshops, students learned the truth about how crimes and violence occur. They were taught how to recognize  the signs of impending violence and how criminals choose and stalk their victims. They also learned simple methods to    reduce risk in their lives and how to lower their profiles as a potential victim. <br>
<br>
From the feedback, we see that these workshops are a huge success. Comments include &quot;Awesome&quot;, &quot;Fantastic&quot;, and &quot;Exceeded my expectations&quot;. The GSA now offers StreetSense Safety courses 4 times per year.<br>

              Kerry,<br>
<br>
On behalf of the management team and officers with CBSA at the Calgary International Airport, I would like to<br>
sincerely thank you for the series of three presentations you did for our team meetings in November. The teams<br>
were very appreciative of all the time and effort you put in to creating and delivering the well-articulated<br>
presentation. You are clearly an expert in your field, and you effectively communicated extremely critical<br>
information regarding the environment we work in.<br>
<br>
You are certainly passionate about your work and as such, gave an effective inside look at the realities of working<br>
amongst significant threats in the law enforcement field. Presenting this realistic view was certainly an eye opening      <br>
experience, and a good reminder for how critical it is to stay vigilant in our line of work. Given the number of gang<br>
affiliates we encounter and the issues that surround them such as drug trafficking and officer safety, hearing you<br>
share your wealth of knowledge was invaluable.<br>
<br>
The officers gave phenomenal feedback specific to your presentation, and still enthusiastically discuss the material you covered. Your presentations are highly relevant to our daily operations, and as uniformed law enforcement officers, reiterating the inherent risk we are at is an essential message. Furthermore, the steps we should be taking to protect ourselves and mitigate these risks were very much appreciated and well-received. I cannot thank you enough for taking time out of your busy day to offer your expertise with the highly comprehensive presentation. Please do stay in touch, and I hope to have you back for future presentations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              The first time I had the fortune of training with Street Sense Safety &amp; Security was early 2010 on a high risk security operators course offered By Modus Concepts of Calgary, Alberta. From the onset of the training provided by Tim and Kerry I could easily see that this was going to be unlike any training in hand to hand combat and self defense that I had received either with the Military or acquired in the private sector. Their instruction was clear, concise and to the point. They were able to take a handful of individuals over a short period of time and teach the basic fundamentals and importance of  unarmed defense against attackers either armed or unarmed. Also important to note is that they advocated that the best defense to an attack is to be able to avoid confrontation altogether. <br>
<br>
As an owner of a private security company I find the need for practical, realistic training is of the utmost importance to operate professionally and effectively. So whether you are new to the private security industry or you are an experienced security officer looking to brush up on your physical defense skills you need look no further than StreetSense Safety &amp; Security. <br>

Excellent approach, philosophy and self-defense techniques. Great methods of instructing and just the right amount of theory to practical ratio. Appreciated the energy and encouragement.<br>
<br>
Very knowledgeable and professional, well done.<br>
<br>
Excellent! Clear instruction, motivated and dedicated with real-life experience.<br>
<br>
The physical instruction from Kerry and Tim was excellent. The course is a hostile environment program and if I train as I have been taught; then I will fight how I have been taught; whether at home or overseas. As Daniel made clear throughout the course, better to be tried by 12 than carried by 6! Overall, an excellent course. <br>
<br>
Excellent instructional techniques, focused and very approachable.<br>
<br>
Very serious about what they teach due to the nature of their jobs and still managed to keep the course enjoyable; well done.<br>
<br>
Enjoyed the self-defense classes and nice to see (well hear) Kerry getting stuck-in during the resistance to interrogation phase.<br>
<br>
No suggestions keep doing what you are doing, great course, loved the realism and the adrenaline inoculation <br>
