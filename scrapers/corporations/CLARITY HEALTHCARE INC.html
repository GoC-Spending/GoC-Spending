              Each discipline has the independence to input their own data which not only improves efficiency, but also enhances the quality of the data being collected at the Hospital. Our clinicians working with Clarity Healthcare for NRRS are pleased about how easy it is to use and there is very little maintenance required by our IT department which reduces the workload for our support staff.<br>

Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre is a state-of-the-art acute care facility serving the healthcare needs of people living in Thunder Bay and Northwestern Ontario. The Regional Health Sciences Centre has 375 acute care beds and is closely affiliated with St. Josephs Care Group which operates 586 beds at multiple sites throughout Thunder Bay and is a recognized leader in the provision of complex care, rehabilitation, mental health and long term care services. <br>
<br>
Though the Regional Health Sciences Centre and St. Josephs Care Group are distinct corporate entities, they work closely together to coordinate across the continuum of care. When the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS) was mandated in October of 2005, the two organizations made plans for a system that would serve the inpatient Mental Health services provided through the Regional Health Sciences Centre (50 beds) and the Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital (76 beds).<br>
<br>
The Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital was doing assessments as a result of participation in some of the early pilot projects with clinical staff completing paper-based forms. According to Therese Lim, the RAI coordinator for Mental Health, this manual process caused delays especially when staff missed filling in a required field. Then it would take as much as a few days before the error would be caught and corrected. The Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre also had to start collecting assessment data and prepare for submissions.<br>
<br>
Through the end of 2005, data was collected manually as Lim and the team evaluated systems that the shared IT group could use to support a common electronic OMHRS data collection and submission system for the two sites. Lims team looked at several options that would allow them to integrate an assessment solution with their ADT system, be compatible with existing IT requirements such as the SQL database, and that would be user friendly and minimize training time and costs.<br>
<br>
After an intensive set of on-site vendor demonstrations that included participation by the clinician users, Clarity Healthcare for MHRS was selected. Lim started training staff in the first two weeks of January 2006 as Clarity Healthcare for MHRS was implemented and by February had 200 staff trained in using the system. Staff are finding it much nicer to use than the paper-based forms states Lim. Its easier to fill in so were getting complete information in a timelier fashion. With the error-checking built in, were getting much better data quality. When staff describe the Clarity Healthcare solution with the words  cool and user-friendly, I knew we had made the best decision.<br>
 <br>
Now that the Mental Health services teams are collecting data electronically and have completed several reporting submissions successfully, Lim is looking to start using the data for performance reporting and analysis as well as making it available to the research department. When asked whether there is anything else that sets Clarity Healthcare apart from the competition, she says, support response time has been really critical for us. The team at Clarity Healthcare deserves a lot of credit because theyve been there whenever we have had a question or needed any assistance.<br>
<br>

Pembroke Regional Hospital serves a population of 13,000 northwest of Ottawa and delivers a wide range of health services to the community. The hospital employs over 750 staff, including 120 doctors and 10 dentists. It recently completed a major new building project and now serves as one of the Stroke Strategy Centres for the Province.<br>
<br>
The hospital originally implemented the CIHI Access database tool to support the submission of rehab data for the National Rehabilitation Reporting System (NRS). While there was no initial cost to use this tool, the hospital quickly realized that they were not able to eliminate the expense and delays associated with paper forms and a single data entry point.<br>
<br>
The Hospital then implemented the database from the Sisters of Charity (SOC). Pembroke had to develop their own interface and provide their own support since ongoing maintenance was unavailable from SOC. All this meant there were some major delays with submission of Rehab data to CIHI as well as low acceptance from clinical staff because of poor data quality.<br>
<br>
Bernie Roosen, IT Manager at Pembroke, decided that the free tools offered by CIHI and SOC were too costly over time. Internally developed and supported product may seem prudent at first, but it just couldnt deliver the reliability of a professionally engineered and vendor-supported solution, said Roosen. We chose the Clarity Healthcare solution for its ease of use and ability to integrate quickly with our systems. It was implemented in under a month and we were able to convert the data from the prior solutions without incident.<br>
<br>
The Pembroke implementation included a seamless integration with their ADT, using a standard XML data transformation to pre-populate records and give clinical staff a head start in capturing patient data. Ongoing regulator updates and maintenance are provided quickly and professionally, saving Pembroke from dealing with the ongoing support issues they had with previous internally maintained systems.<br>
<br>
According to Sabine Mersmann, Director of Rehab Services, the system was so easy to use the clinical staff basically trained themselves. The use of an in-house training environment means staff can do refresh training whenever, wherever they want. Roosen is greatly relieved that Pembroke has a cost-effective NRS solution now and no support headaches saying Consulting Cadre has been very quick to respond and take care of things before it becomes an issue. They actually independently did our last upgrade over a weekend and when we came in Monday our users were working right away. <br>
<br>
As a result of the success of the NRS solution, Roosen is now implementing the solution for Pembrokes Mental Health inpatient unit. &quot;After an extended wait for our ADT vendor to produce an acceptable product for MHRS, our clinical staff went with the proven solution and selected Clarity Healthcare for MHRS.&quot;<br>
<br>

AD QUOTE<br>
Bernie Roosen, IT Manager at Pembroke Regional Hospital. We selected Clarity Healthcare Solutions for the ease of use and ability to seamlessly integrate with our ADT system. Not only was it implemented in under a month but we were able to convert the previous data without incident. Weve been so satisfied with the NRS solution, were now doing the same for MHRS.<br>

              Clarity Healthcare has been implemented at leading teaching hospitals to integrate with legacy systems. The Clarity Healthcare Solution is used in community and regional hospitals to provide multi-facility access to patient assessments.<br>
Clarity healthcare is integrated with Meditec, Cerner, Misys and Anzer ADT systems. Using standard HL7 messaging the software can be used to integrate leading healthcare software.

              Each discipline has the independence to input their own data which not only improves efficiency, but also enhances the quality of the data being collected at the Hospital. Our clinicians working with Clarity Healthcare for NRRS are pleased about how easy it is to use and there is very little maintenance required by our IT department which reduces the workload for our support staff.<br>

Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre is a state-of-the-art acute care facility serving the healthcare needs of people living in Thunder Bay and Northwestern Ontario. The Regional Health Sciences Centre has 375 acute care beds and is closely affiliated with St. Josephs Care Group which operates 586 beds at multiple sites throughout Thunder Bay and is a recognized leader in the provision of complex care, rehabilitation, mental health and long term care services. <br>
<br>
Though the Regional Health Sciences Centre and St. Josephs Care Group are distinct corporate entities, they work closely together to coordinate across the continuum of care. When the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS) was mandated in October of 2005, the two organizations made plans for a system that would serve the inpatient Mental Health services provided through the Regional Health Sciences Centre (50 beds) and the Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital (76 beds).<br>
<br>
The Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital was doing assessments as a result of participation in some of the early pilot projects with clinical staff completing paper-based forms. According to Therese Lim, the RAI coordinator for Mental Health, this manual process caused delays especially when staff missed filling in a required field. Then it would take as much as a few days before the error would be caught and corrected. The Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre also had to start collecting assessment data and prepare for submissions.<br>
<br>
Through the end of 2005, data was collected manually as Lim and the team evaluated systems that the shared IT group could use to support a common electronic OMHRS data collection and submission system for the two sites. Lims team looked at several options that would allow them to integrate an assessment solution with their ADT system, be compatible with existing IT requirements such as the SQL database, and that would be user friendly and minimize training time and costs.<br>
<br>
After an intensive set of on-site vendor demonstrations that included participation by the clinician users, Clarity Healthcare for MHRS was selected. Lim started training staff in the first two weeks of January 2006 as Clarity Healthcare for MHRS was implemented and by February had 200 staff trained in using the system. Staff are finding it much nicer to use than the paper-based forms states Lim. Its easier to fill in so were getting complete information in a timelier fashion. With the error-checking built in, were getting much better data quality. When staff describe the Clarity Healthcare solution with the words  cool and user-friendly, I knew we had made the best decision.<br>
 <br>
Now that the Mental Health services teams are collecting data electronically and have completed several reporting submissions successfully, Lim is looking to start using the data for performance reporting and analysis as well as making it available to the research department. When asked whether there is anything else that sets Clarity Healthcare apart from the competition, she says, support response time has been really critical for us. The team at Clarity Healthcare deserves a lot of credit because theyve been there whenever we have had a question or needed any assistance.<br>
<br>

Pembroke Regional Hospital serves a population of 13,000 northwest of Ottawa and delivers a wide range of health services to the community. The hospital employs over 750 staff, including 120 doctors and 10 dentists. It recently completed a major new building project and now serves as one of the Stroke Strategy Centres for the Province.<br>
<br>
The hospital originally implemented the CIHI Access database tool to support the submission of rehab data for the National Rehabilitation Reporting System (NRS). While there was no initial cost to use this tool, the hospital quickly realized that they were not able to eliminate the expense and delays associated with paper forms and a single data entry point.<br>
<br>
The Hospital then implemented the database from the Sisters of Charity (SOC). Pembroke had to develop their own interface and provide their own support since ongoing maintenance was unavailable from SOC. All this meant there were some major delays with submission of Rehab data to CIHI as well as low acceptance from clinical staff because of poor data quality.<br>
<br>
Bernie Roosen, IT Manager at Pembroke, decided that the free tools offered by CIHI and SOC were too costly over time. Internally developed and supported product may seem prudent at first, but it just couldnt deliver the reliability of a professionally engineered and vendor-supported solution, said Roosen. We chose the Clarity Healthcare solution for its ease of use and ability to integrate quickly with our systems. It was implemented in under a month and we were able to convert the data from the prior solutions without incident.<br>
<br>
The Pembroke implementation included a seamless integration with their ADT, using a standard XML data transformation to pre-populate records and give clinical staff a head start in capturing patient data. Ongoing regulator updates and maintenance are provided quickly and professionally, saving Pembroke from dealing with the ongoing support issues they had with previous internally maintained systems.<br>
<br>
According to Sabine Mersmann, Director of Rehab Services, the system was so easy to use the clinical staff basically trained themselves. The use of an in-house training environment means staff can do refresh training whenever, wherever they want. Roosen is greatly relieved that Pembroke has a cost-effective NRS solution now and no support headaches saying Consulting Cadre has been very quick to respond and take care of things before it becomes an issue. They actually independently did our last upgrade over a weekend and when we came in Monday our users were working right away. <br>
<br>
As a result of the success of the NRS solution, Roosen is now implementing the solution for Pembrokes Mental Health inpatient unit. &quot;After an extended wait for our ADT vendor to produce an acceptable product for MHRS, our clinical staff went with the proven solution and selected Clarity Healthcare for MHRS.&quot;<br>
<br>

AD QUOTE<br>
Bernie Roosen, IT Manager at Pembroke Regional Hospital. We selected Clarity Healthcare Solutions for the ease of use and ability to seamlessly integrate with our ADT system. Not only was it implemented in under a month but we were able to convert the previous data without incident. Weve been so satisfied with the NRS solution, were now doing the same for MHRS.<br>
