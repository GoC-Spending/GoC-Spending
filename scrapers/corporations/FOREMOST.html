                            Foremost floating cushion subs (FCS) are utilized in both slanted and vertical drilling operations to reduce vibration and wear of the drill string and drill rig components. Foremost manufactures several FCS models for mining, construction, water well and oilfield applications. The sliding spindle of the cushion sub permits the threads of the mating drill string components to float together or apart during rotation without any axial movement of the rotary drive. This decreases the impact on the rotary drive when the two mating threads are joined and decreases the load on the threads of the mating components.<br>
<br>
The Floating Cushion Sub performs two important functions:<br>
•It provides a means of making up and breaking out threaded connections without damaging threads.<br>
•It prolongs bearing and gear life of the rotary top drive.<br>
<br>
Foremost floating cushion subs are an economical accessory with the proven ability to help increase tooling life and reduce equipment downtime.<br>

                            Threaded directly into the spindle of the rotary gearbox, the Foremost Cushion Connector helps protect the rotary drive and mast assembly against torsional and axial vibrations and shock loading in moderate and extreme drilling conditions. The result is reduced drill maintenance, increased uptime and lower drilling costs.<br>
<br>
Disc springs are utilized which allow a range of axial movement between the drill stem and the rotary drive. The disc springs accommodate operating loads ranging from 8,000 to 120,000 lbs. (3,630 - 54,430 kg). In most cases, this is sufficient to help keep the tri-cone bit in continuous contact with the formation, thereby reducing the possibility of fracturing or breaking the carbides in the bit.<br>
<br>
Urethane drive blocks located within the connector assembly serve to provide 100% transfer of rotary torque from the drive spindle to the drill stem as well as absorb torsional vibration transferred by the bit. Foremost Cushion Connectors are utilized in mining applications worldwide on large and mid-range blast hole drills. In most cases, no modifications to the drill are required. The cushion connector is installed directly onto the rotary drive spindle via a threaded connection. A saver sub is usually utilized on the lower end of the cushion connector.<br>

                            The FI-70 features twin variable displacement axial piston motors and single-bearing hardened skate bars with 10% more area than most other injectors of comparable rating. It also has eight skate traction cylinders evenly distributing the load over the entire length of the skate bar with hydraulic accumulators.<br>
<br>
F200K Injector<br>
<br>
The F200K utilizes two independent opposing chain reduction drives, each fitted with follower rollers and gripper blocks. The drives are mounted in a common frame and a solid skate bar is used within each drive assembly to apply pressure to the gripper blocks. The unique design allows for two separate means of mounting the F200K injector - base of top mount arrangement. In addition, foremost injectors are offered with either hydraulic or A/C electric drives.<br>

                            <br>
Foremost Dual Rotary drills feature two rotary drives, including a unique lower rotary drive that is used to advance steel casing through unconsolidated overburden such as sand, gravel, glacial till and boulders. The lower drive feeds and rotates the casing independently of the top drive. The casing is held securely in the lower drive by a set of power-operated jaws. A carbide-studded casing shoe, welded to the casing bottom, cuts through the overburden. Once the desired casing depth is reached, the DR continues drilling open-hole like a conventional top drive drill. There is no need to trip out or change tools when transitioning to open-hole drilling.<br>
<br>
<br>
The independent rotary top drive simultaneously handles a drill string, which can be equipped with a down-the-hole hammer, tri-cone or drag bit. Cuttings are typically evacuated with air, but Foremost DR drills can also be configured with pumps for mud or flooded reverse circulation drilling.<br>
<br>
The upper and lower rotary drives feed independently on separate hydraulic cylinders. This means that the bit position can vary in relation to the casing shoe. In most situations, the bit is advanced slightly ahead of the casing for best penetration rates. In heaving formations, or at times when it is desirable to obtain a clean sample of the formation, the casing can be advanced ahead of the drill bit.<br>
<br>
Over the years, the Dual Rotary method has proven very effective for advancing steel casing in difficult unconsolidated overburden. In addition to the primary benefit of effective penetration, the rotation of the casing results in very straight holes and casing can be easily extracted using the lower drive, which is useful in well abandonment applications and for exposing well screens.<br>
<br>
Available in DR-12, DR-24, DR-24HD, and DR-40 to handle various casing sizes.<br>

                            The Foremost 1000 Hydrovac Package is a unit primarily designed to operate efficiently in urban environments. This unit is sized appropriately to maneuver easier in smaller streets, but maintains its productivity as our larger models. The operating components on this unit are identical to those used on our larger designs, thereby giving the operator the same efficiencies while working, but within a more manageable package.<br>
<br>
The Foremost 1000 is mounted on a tandem axle chassis. This unit holds 1000 gallons of fresh water and 7 cubic yards of debris. All working components are housed in a 42” aluminum, heated, insulated and lit van body. A Robuschi RBDV125 PD Blower provides 4000 CFM and Full Vacuum. The boom is 8”, fully rotational and operated by an Omnex wireless controller. The Omnex also allows for control of vehicle RPM, the wash system, offloading and vacuum functions. The water system features a CAT 3560 wash pump, capable of 3000 psi and 20 GPM, heated by a 740,000 BTU diesel fired boiler. <br>
<br>
Standard with all Foremost units, offloading is performed via our sloped debris tank design, assisted by a wash out system powered by a high volume centrifugal pump. The Foremost 1000 is completely winterized and comes equipped with heated valving, an air blow down system and glycol purge reservoir. <br>
<br>
We recommend this unit to utility contractors who need to provide competitive excavating efficiencies but on a unit that is shorter, lighter and more maneuverable than most other models. <br>

                            The Foremost 1600 Hydrovac model allows for larger capacities, but is designed to be mounted on a heavy tandem chassis. These units have the same equipment as the Foremost 2000, but feature the 42” van body. <br>
<br>
The 1600 allows for water capacities of 1600 gallons and a 13 yard debris body. Vacuum power is supplied by the Robuschi RBDV125 blower. The Cat 3560 wash pump and 740,000 btu boiler are also used on this model. The boom is rear mounted, 8” in diameter, fully rotational and controlled by an Omnex wireless controller, which also controls the vehicle RPM, wash and vacuum functions. All offloading functions can also be performed via the remote.<br>
<br>
Offloading is performed via a sloped debris floor design and wash out system. The dump door is 48” by 58”, providing a large area to allow for tank cleaning.<br>
<br>
Optional 4” Hydratech offloading pump systems are available on this model. This will allow for pumping off in a contained manner when discharging liquid loads. Complete winterization features come standard on this unit.<br>
<br>
We recommend this unit for all applications, both in town and in industrial settings. The van body is smaller, which differs from the Foremost 2000 model. This allows for a shorter truck, but features less heated storage space. <br>

                            Foremost floating cushion subs (FCS) are utilized in both slanted and vertical drilling operations to reduce vibration and wear of the drill string and drill rig components. Foremost manufactures several FCS models for mining, construction, water well and oilfield applications. The sliding spindle of the cushion sub permits the threads of the mating drill string components to float together or apart during rotation without any axial movement of the rotary drive. This decreases the impact on the rotary drive when the two mating threads are joined and decreases the load on the threads of the mating components.<br>
<br>
The Floating Cushion Sub performs two important functions:<br>
•It provides a means of making up and breaking out threaded connections without damaging threads.<br>
•It prolongs bearing and gear life of the rotary top drive.<br>
<br>
Foremost floating cushion subs are an economical accessory with the proven ability to help increase tooling life and reduce equipment downtime.<br>

                            Threaded directly into the spindle of the rotary gearbox, the Foremost Cushion Connector helps protect the rotary drive and mast assembly against torsional and axial vibrations and shock loading in moderate and extreme drilling conditions. The result is reduced drill maintenance, increased uptime and lower drilling costs.<br>
<br>
Disc springs are utilized which allow a range of axial movement between the drill stem and the rotary drive. The disc springs accommodate operating loads ranging from 8,000 to 120,000 lbs. (3,630 - 54,430 kg). In most cases, this is sufficient to help keep the tri-cone bit in continuous contact with the formation, thereby reducing the possibility of fracturing or breaking the carbides in the bit.<br>
<br>
Urethane drive blocks located within the connector assembly serve to provide 100% transfer of rotary torque from the drive spindle to the drill stem as well as absorb torsional vibration transferred by the bit. Foremost Cushion Connectors are utilized in mining applications worldwide on large and mid-range blast hole drills. In most cases, no modifications to the drill are required. The cushion connector is installed directly onto the rotary drive spindle via a threaded connection. A saver sub is usually utilized on the lower end of the cushion connector.<br>

Foremost Dual Rotary drills feature two rotary drives, including a unique lower rotary drive that is used to advance steel casing through unconsolidated overburden such as sand, gravel, glacial till and boulders. The lower drive feeds and rotates the casing independently of the top drive. The casing is held securely in the lower drive by a set of power-operated jaws. A carbide-studded casing shoe, welded to the casing bottom, cuts through the overburden. Once the desired casing depth is reached, the DR continues drilling open-hole like a conventional top drive drill. There is no need to trip out or change tools when transitioning to open-hole drilling.<br>
<br>
<br>
The independent rotary top drive simultaneously handles a drill string, which can be equipped with a down-the-hole hammer, tri-cone or drag bit. Cuttings are typically evacuated with air, but Foremost DR drills can also be configured with pumps for mud or flooded reverse circulation drilling.<br>
<br>
The upper and lower rotary drives feed independently on separate hydraulic cylinders. This means that the bit position can vary in relation to the casing shoe. In most situations, the bit is advanced slightly ahead of the casing for best penetration rates. In heaving formations, or at times when it is desirable to obtain a clean sample of the formation, the casing can be advanced ahead of the drill bit.<br>
<br>
Over the years, the Dual Rotary method has proven very effective for advancing steel casing in difficult unconsolidated overburden. In addition to the primary benefit of effective penetration, the rotation of the casing results in very straight holes and casing can be easily extracted using the lower drive, which is useful in well abandonment applications and for exposing well screens.<br>
<br>
Available in DR-12, DR-24, DR-24HD, and DR-40 to handle various casing sizes.<br>

                            The Foremost 1000 Hydrovac Package is a unit primarily designed to operate efficiently in urban environments. This unit is sized appropriately to maneuver easier in smaller streets, but maintains its productivity as our larger models. The operating components on this unit are identical to those used on our larger designs, thereby giving the operator the same efficiencies while working, but within a more manageable package.<br>
<br>
The Foremost 1000 is mounted on a tandem axle chassis. This unit holds 1000 gallons of fresh water and 7 cubic yards of debris. All working components are housed in a 42” aluminum, heated, insulated and lit van body. A Robuschi RBDV125 PD Blower provides 4000 CFM and Full Vacuum. The boom is 8”, fully rotational and operated by an Omnex wireless controller. The Omnex also allows for control of vehicle RPM, the wash system, offloading and vacuum functions. The water system features a CAT 3560 wash pump, capable of 3000 psi and 20 GPM, heated by a 740,000 BTU diesel fired boiler. <br>
<br>
Standard with all Foremost units, offloading is performed via our sloped debris tank design, assisted by a wash out system powered by a high volume centrifugal pump. The Foremost 1000 is completely winterized and comes equipped with heated valving, an air blow down system and glycol purge reservoir. <br>
<br>
We recommend this unit to utility contractors who need to provide competitive excavating efficiencies but on a unit that is shorter, lighter and more maneuverable than most other models. <br>

The 1600 allows for water capacities of 1600 gallons and a 13 yard debris body. Vacuum power is supplied by the Robuschi RBDV125 blower. The Cat 3560 wash pump and 740,000 btu boiler are also used on this model. The boom is rear mounted, 8” in diameter, fully rotational and controlled by an Omnex wireless controller, which also controls the vehicle RPM, wash and vacuum functions. All offloading functions can also be performed via the remote.<br>
<br>
Offloading is performed via a sloped debris floor design and wash out system. The dump door is 48” by 58”, providing a large area to allow for tank cleaning.<br>
<br>
Optional 4” Hydratech offloading pump systems are available on this model. This will allow for pumping off in a contained manner when discharging liquid loads. Complete winterization features come standard on this unit.<br>
<br>
We recommend this unit for all applications, both in town and in industrial settings. The van body is smaller, which differs from the Foremost 2000 model. This allows for a shorter truck, but features less heated storage space. <br>

                            The Foremost 2000 is our most popular model. This unit is mounted on a tridem or quad axle chassis. These units feature 2000 gallon water tanks, 13 yard debris bodies and a 70” aluminum, heated, lit and insulated van body.<br>
<br>
Available with a standard Robuschi RBDV125 blower or the optional Robuschi RBDV145, which provides 6400 CFM and full vacuum. We recommend the Robuschi RBDV125 for most applications. This blower provides plenty of power, costs less and will save on fuel and weight. <br>
<br>
All working components are housed in the large 70” van body. The structure is aluminum, extremely durable, fully insulated and lit. It provides ample storage room, featuring a shelving unit and microwave on the driver’s side.<br>
<br>
The water system is comprised of a CAT 3560 wash pump, 740,000 BTU boiler and full winterization features. <br>
<br>
The 26’ rear mounted extendable boom is controlled by a wireless Omnex controller, which also allows for control of the offloading, vacuum, wash and vehicle RPM functions. This boom is stored on the rear fender with the dig tube attached for convenient digging to 18 feet of depth prior to adding any extension pipe.<br>
<br>
As standard with all Foremost models, each unit comes equipped with an extra vacuum filter and all other oils and filters for the first service change.<br>
<br>
An excellent unit for Oil &amp; Gas and Industrial applications. <br>
