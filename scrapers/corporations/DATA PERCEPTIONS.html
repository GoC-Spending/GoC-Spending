                            New initiatives are an excellent time to include security with the solution from the ground up, from equipment to operational practices. Security involves mitigating risks holistically with security costs optimized around the risk potential.<br>
<br>
Common risk categories include:<br>
<br>
•Major Revenue Stream Risks and Dependencies,<br>
•Intellectual Property Risks, and <br>
•Brand &amp; Reputation Risks.<br>

                            Organizations face many challenges in using technology to enhance and improve operations for significant business gains. IT strategic planning is often not done or only partially complete and fails to identify good opportunities for significant business gains. In some organizations, the IT department is not close enough to business operations to keep up with their needs.<br>
<br>
A holistic approach to innovation, has led some organizations to combine technology and operations groups under common leadership or increase collaboration between the groups through organizational structure. The collaboration of the whole team and interdependence of the technology and operations groups working together, makes innovation easier and faster. As a new and evolving business unit, Technology and Operations is seen as a vital component of future business gains, accelerating the rate of innovation and business agility.<br>

                            Key line of business applications are supporting pillars of the organization’s operations and should be second nature to those using them. They speed up the work, reduce labour, enable communications, and provide information to people enabling them to make better decisions and efficiently complete activities.<br>
<br>
Many of these key business applications are “off the shelf” with configuration or customization. Integration can be completed to make a variety of “off the shelf” applications work together to better meet the needs the organization. Custom development is occasionally required to address unique objectives.<br>
<br>
We can help create this ecosystem of applications through:<br>
<br>
•requirements development,<br>
•work flow development,<br>
•vendor and software selection,<br>
•cloud application selection,<br>
•technology evaluations for fit and customization,<br>
•integration, and<br>
•new application development.<br>

                            Implementation excellence in operational improvement projects is key to enhancing quality products, services, and increasing productivity. Skills to complete projects efficiently and quickly, with expected results, are essential to reduce costs and to obtain the benefits of planned improvements.<br>
<br>
Technology and operations roadmaps can help to:<br>
<br>
•	illustrate project timing,<br>
•	map and keep key deliverables top of mind,<br>
•	monitor progress of a portfolio of projects, and<br>
•	prioritize new project initiation.<br>
<br>
This helps to ensure that capacity does not exceed available resources, the most important projects get done first, and improvement benefits are realized in expected timeframes. It helps to stay within an organization’s capacity for change and meet marketplace demands.<br>

                            Every organization has finite resources to apply to information security. Understanding areas of risk and the organization&#39;s ability to monitor and mitigate risks is the key to developing an appropriate risk mitigation strategy. <br>
People looking to compromise the security of an organization look for the easiest or weakest link in the security profile of an organization. A balanced, holistic, and layered approach is required to identify and mitigate risks. Information security is an ongoing series of processes, procedures, and practices working together.<br>
<br>
The questions facing every organization relevant to information security are: <br>
•Where is the organization vulnerable? <br>
•How does an organization know what should be done? <br>
•How often should it be done? <br>
•What should not be done? <br>
•Are the resources available? <br>
•Does it make sense financially? <br>
<br>
Data Perceptions has developed a formal approach to helping organizations arrive at the answer to these questions and to provide a roadmap on which to proceed in their risk mitigation effort.<br>

                            Cloud services offer advantages in scale of operations and specialized expertise.

A seamless transition is important to all aspects of the business and the people involved. Cloud service migration often requires extra skills and abilities to complete successfully.<br>

            <div>Our Business Model<br>
 <br>
The Data Perceptions business model allows us to put together a team of professionals that best suits customer specific Technology &amp; Operations (Tech &amp; Ops) challenges.<br>
 <br>
Data Perceptions&#39; focus is on combining technical and business expertise to help companies meet their operational business objectives through the use of technology.  Our structure is ideally suited to collaborative strategic planning, design and implementation through the augmentation of client teams from a variety of sources.<br>
<br>
We do this by starting with our core team of project strategists (enterprise architects), who meet with client stakeholders, analyze objectives and requirements, develop strategies and recommendations, and provide high level design and budgeting services.  We enhance the team as required with job specific project managers, industry specialists, and key technical people drawn from our extensive talent community.<br>
 <br>
Over the past decade, we have strengthened this talent community by actively seeking out and connecting with organizations that augment our services and share our focus on providing exceptional value to the client. To ensure effective collaboration, we look for companies with strong ethics that demonstrate a good fit with our core values. We also target a 15-40% overlap in services knowledge which creates the foundation for strong teamwork and successful integration with client teams. <br>
<br>
By working collaboratively with clients on project planning and implementation, client staff benefit from knowledge transfer and training during the project deployment. This allows operational teams to provide ongoing maintenance, support, and enhancements of the solution. <br>
<br>
With this business model, we aim to provide the best suited personnel for each project, enabling us to finish on schedule, and with the expected results.<br>

              Data Perceptions&#39; consultant team of exceptional people is comprised of staff and subcontract associates. Staff consultants are project strategists, or enterprise architects with a variety of business and technical skills. Associates range from project strategist generalists to very niche specialists with technical or business knowledge. Data Perceptions&#39; technology and operations consulting model utilizes a wide range of knowledge and experience.<br>
 <br>
Data Perceptions&#39; core competency is crafting project teams to overcome business problems and deliver operational improvements through the use of technology. Our core values and guiding principles are essential in selecting entrepreneurial people with good attitudes and values, to form effective project teams, quickly and easily. Data Perceptions uses project strategists to guide and build project teams.<br>
 <br>
Project implementation teams usually involve project strategist(s), a project manager, Data Perceptions&#39; subject matter experts, and the customer&#39; workforce. Strategy development teams are led by two project strategists. Subject matter experts are brought in during problem definition and solution development. Technology strategy development can address a specific problem or development of an IT strategy road map of prioritized projects for the organization.<br>
 <br>
Although collaborative projects with a variety of personnel are typical, engagements requiring specific expertise, skills, or experience are available to fulfill customer needs.<br>
 <br>
Over a 20 year period, Data Perceptions&#39; talent network has grown to hundreds of associates. We have consulting personnel in over 12 countries.

The Communitech Hub is a 44,000 ft² digital media innovation center that brings entrepreneurs, multi-national companies, and academic institutions together under one roof to build global digital media companies.<br>
 <br>
Since the opening of The Communitech Hub in October 2010, Communitech has played a key role in tech company deals and the emergence of new digital media companies.  Located in Kitchener, Ontario in what used to be the British Commonwealth&#39;s largest tannery, the Communitech Hub houses technology start-ups, splices innovation into enterprise, seeds partnerships, fuses digital media with venture capital and brings entrepreneurs, multinational companies and academic institutions together. The Hub is the largest of Communitech&#39;s three facilities in Waterloo Region.<br>
 <br>
Data Perceptions was responsible for developing the IT Strategy for the IT infrastructure for Communitech to support Communitech&#39;s operations and the technology start-ups that call the Communitech Hub their home.  Data Perceptions&#39; team designed and managed the implementation of the high density wireless infrastructure; high bandwidth, prioritized, secure, Internet connectivity; and a high availability corporate network and server environment.  The environment utilized technologies such as VMware, HP SAN, Meru wireless, and HP switches and servers.<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;We are a small organization without the ability to hire in-house IT expertise and with my skills lying in a very different direction.  Data Perceptions brought us the extensive IT expertise needed to research the external environment and build an IT modernization proposal that would suit our needs and work with our budget.  I cant emphasize enough the peace of mind that their assistance brought to the management team and the Board.<br>
Once the IT modernization project started, our Project Manager was on hand checking with me every step of the way to ensure that the project was on time and on budget and providing the reports that I needed to take to my Board.   After implementation he stayed in touch with me to ensure everything was running smoothly and providing advice about next steps.  So often it is this after care piece that gets forgotten once the primary invoices are paid.  With Data Perceptions, I felt that I had an IT safety net to fall back on when I needed it  even post implementation.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
We have done business with Data Perceptions for 4 years and they have completed a variety of assignments for us. The work has been wide-ranging. There was a short-term need for expertise to resolve a problem with the machine setup on the Production floor that had been dogging us for six months - the person they sent resolved the problem in one day! They also supplied us with a crew of software developers over six months to help clear the report-writing backlog for a major ERP implementation. The reports they delivered were all delivered on time and of a high enough quality that they have needed no maintenance. I am always confident that the people they send in to do a job will have the right skill set to complete the job.<br>
 <br>
I have worked with many contract developers, and I can honestly say that I have never worked with a developer group as organized, procedural, and detail oriented. The professionalism that Data Perceptions enforces shines through. In my opinion working with a contractor supply company boils down to a relationship issue. With Data Perceptions, when an issue comes up,they resolve it. The bottom line is results, and our results with them have always been good!<br>

                            New initiatives are an excellent time to include security with the solution from the ground up, from equipment to operational practices. Security involves mitigating risks holistically with security costs optimized around the risk potential.<br>
<br>
Common risk categories include:<br>
<br>
•Major Revenue Stream Risks and Dependencies,<br>
•Intellectual Property Risks, and <br>
•Brand &amp; Reputation Risks.<br>

                            Organizations face many challenges in using technology to enhance and improve operations for significant business gains. IT strategic planning is often not done or only partially complete and fails to identify good opportunities for significant business gains. In some organizations, the IT department is not close enough to business operations to keep up with their needs.<br>
<br>
A holistic approach to innovation, has led some organizations to combine technology and operations groups under common leadership or increase collaboration between the groups through organizational structure. The collaboration of the whole team and interdependence of the technology and operations groups working together, makes innovation easier and faster. As a new and evolving business unit, Technology and Operations is seen as a vital component of future business gains, accelerating the rate of innovation and business agility.<br>

                            Key line of business applications are supporting pillars of the organization’s operations and should be second nature to those using them. They speed up the work, reduce labour, enable communications, and provide information to people enabling them to make better decisions and efficiently complete activities.<br>
<br>
Many of these key business applications are “off the shelf” with configuration or customization. Integration can be completed to make a variety of “off the shelf” applications work together to better meet the needs the organization. Custom development is occasionally required to address unique objectives.<br>
<br>
We can help create this ecosystem of applications through:<br>
<br>
•requirements development,<br>
•work flow development,<br>
•vendor and software selection,<br>
•cloud application selection,<br>
•technology evaluations for fit and customization,<br>
•integration, and<br>
•new application development.<br>

                            Implementation excellence in operational improvement projects is key to enhancing quality products, services, and increasing productivity. Skills to complete projects efficiently and quickly, with expected results, are essential to reduce costs and to obtain the benefits of planned improvements.<br>
<br>
Technology and operations roadmaps can help to:<br>
<br>
•	illustrate project timing,<br>
•	map and keep key deliverables top of mind,<br>
•	monitor progress of a portfolio of projects, and<br>
•	prioritize new project initiation.<br>
<br>
This helps to ensure that capacity does not exceed available resources, the most important projects get done first, and improvement benefits are realized in expected timeframes. It helps to stay within an organization’s capacity for change and meet marketplace demands.<br>

                            Every organization has finite resources to apply to information security. Understanding areas of risk and the organization&#39;s ability to monitor and mitigate risks is the key to developing an appropriate risk mitigation strategy. <br>
People looking to compromise the security of an organization look for the easiest or weakest link in the security profile of an organization. A balanced, holistic, and layered approach is required to identify and mitigate risks. Information security is an ongoing series of processes, procedures, and practices working together.<br>
<br>
The questions facing every organization relevant to information security are: <br>
•Where is the organization vulnerable? <br>
•How does an organization know what should be done? <br>
•How often should it be done? <br>
•What should not be done? <br>
•Are the resources available? <br>
•Does it make sense financially? <br>
<br>
Data Perceptions has developed a formal approach to helping organizations arrive at the answer to these questions and to provide a roadmap on which to proceed in their risk mitigation effort.<br>

Our staffs also sub-contract to our consulting/working partners to fulfill requirements within their projects<br>
 <br>

Data Perceptions does maintain relationships with a wide variety of hardware and software vendors through their value added resellers (VARs), and their consultant liaison and partner programs. These relationships allow Data Perceptions to understand the value and the fit of these solutions. The education and professional development opportunities allow us to know what works well without biasing us financially.<br>

We do this by starting with our core team of project strategists (enterprise architects), who meet with client stakeholders, analyze objectives and requirements, develop strategies and recommendations, and provide high level design and budgeting services.  We enhance the team as required with job specific project managers, industry specialists, and key technical people drawn from our extensive talent community.<br>
 <br>
Over the past decade, we have strengthened this talent community by actively seeking out and connecting with organizations that augment our services and share our focus on providing exceptional value to the client. To ensure effective collaboration, we look for companies with strong ethics that demonstrate a good fit with our core values. We also target a 15-40% overlap in services knowledge which creates the foundation for strong teamwork and successful integration with client teams. <br>
<br>
By working collaboratively with clients on project planning and implementation, client staff benefit from knowledge transfer and training during the project deployment. This allows operational teams to provide ongoing maintenance, support, and enhancements of the solution. <br>
<br>
With this business model, we aim to provide the best suited personnel for each project, enabling us to finish on schedule, and with the expected results.<br>

              Data Perceptions&#39; consultant team of exceptional people is comprised of staff and subcontract associates. Staff consultants are project strategists, or enterprise architects with a variety of business and technical skills. Associates range from project strategist generalists to very niche specialists with technical or business knowledge. Data Perceptions&#39; technology and operations consulting model utilizes a wide range of knowledge and experience.<br>
 <br>
Data Perceptions&#39; core competency is crafting project teams to overcome business problems and deliver operational improvements through the use of technology. Our core values and guiding principles are essential in selecting entrepreneurial people with good attitudes and values, to form effective project teams, quickly and easily. Data Perceptions uses project strategists to guide and build project teams.<br>
 <br>
Project implementation teams usually involve project strategist(s), a project manager, Data Perceptions&#39; subject matter experts, and the customer&#39; workforce. Strategy development teams are led by two project strategists. Subject matter experts are brought in during problem definition and solution development. Technology strategy development can address a specific problem or development of an IT strategy road map of prioritized projects for the organization.<br>
 <br>
Although collaborative projects with a variety of personnel are typical, engagements requiring specific expertise, skills, or experience are available to fulfill customer needs.<br>
 <br>
Over a 20 year period, Data Perceptions&#39; talent network has grown to hundreds of associates. We have consulting personnel in over 12 countries.

The Communitech Hub is a 44,000 ft² digital media innovation center that brings entrepreneurs, multi-national companies, and academic institutions together under one roof to build global digital media companies.<br>
 <br>
Since the opening of The Communitech Hub in October 2010, Communitech has played a key role in tech company deals and the emergence of new digital media companies.  Located in Kitchener, Ontario in what used to be the British Commonwealth&#39;s largest tannery, the Communitech Hub houses technology start-ups, splices innovation into enterprise, seeds partnerships, fuses digital media with venture capital and brings entrepreneurs, multinational companies and academic institutions together. The Hub is the largest of Communitech&#39;s three facilities in Waterloo Region.<br>
 <br>
Data Perceptions was responsible for developing the IT Strategy for the IT infrastructure for Communitech to support Communitech&#39;s operations and the technology start-ups that call the Communitech Hub their home.  Data Perceptions&#39; team designed and managed the implementation of the high density wireless infrastructure; high bandwidth, prioritized, secure, Internet connectivity; and a high availability corporate network and server environment.  The environment utilized technologies such as VMware, HP SAN, Meru wireless, and HP switches and servers.<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;We are a small organization without the ability to hire in-house IT expertise and with my skills lying in a very different direction.  Data Perceptions brought us the extensive IT expertise needed to research the external environment and build an IT modernization proposal that would suit our needs and work with our budget.  I cant emphasize enough the peace of mind that their assistance brought to the management team and the Board.<br>
Once the IT modernization project started, our Project Manager was on hand checking with me every step of the way to ensure that the project was on time and on budget and providing the reports that I needed to take to my Board.   After implementation he stayed in touch with me to ensure everything was running smoothly and providing advice about next steps.  So often it is this after care piece that gets forgotten once the primary invoices are paid.  With Data Perceptions, I felt that I had an IT safety net to fall back on when I needed it  even post implementation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Katya Manyk, CEO, Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators<br>

<br>
<br>
We have done business with Data Perceptions for 4 years and they have completed a variety of assignments for us. The work has been wide-ranging. There was a short-term need for expertise to resolve a problem with the machine setup on the Production floor that had been dogging us for six months - the person they sent resolved the problem in one day! They also supplied us with a crew of software developers over six months to help clear the report-writing backlog for a major ERP implementation. The reports they delivered were all delivered on time and of a high enough quality that they have needed no maintenance. I am always confident that the people they send in to do a job will have the right skill set to complete the job.<br>
 <br>
I have worked with many contract developers, and I can honestly say that I have never worked with a developer group as organized, procedural, and detail oriented. The professionalism that Data Perceptions enforces shines through. In my opinion working with a contractor supply company boils down to a relationship issue. With Data Perceptions, when an issue comes up,they resolve it. The bottom line is results, and our results with them have always been good!<br>
