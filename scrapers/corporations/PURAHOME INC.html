                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              In many, many offices, where employees complain of fatigue, sickness easily spreading from one worker to another, allergies, headaches, odours and even nausea, Purahome&#39;s carefully selcted air purifers coupled with Purahome&#39;s filtration formulas for sizing systems has resulted in great results. For example, we were told that many workers at First Ontario Credit Union were able to eliminate completely or reduce their allergy medications in half within a couple of days. We have many successful installations in challenging environments that are a result of thorough air and/or water testing and analysis as well as occupant analysis for existing health issues and concerns. The Cotton Cement Processing Plant has indoor air that now has lower particulate levels than outdoor air! We also believe and have been told by several wineries that Flat Rock Cellars Winery is the only winery run on well water. Several factors including water quality, aesthetics, limited space, and applications needed in the wine-making process had to be considered to successfully treat and provide water for the entire facility. Ontario Power Generation sent in a list of chemicals they use in a certain room with a couple of employees, and based on the chemicals used, Purahome provided a specific air cleaner designed to remove the volatile chemicals in that unique environement. Every satisified customer is the result of meticulously selected product and Purahome&#39;s scientific process to best help determine which technologies are best-suited for our customers.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Purahome Inc. is very pleased with the feedback that has been received from our customers. Here is a brief sample of what some of them had to say.<br>
<br>
<br>
In January we had the HEPA system installed in our home , and what a difference it has made for us! Dust levels are dramatically reduced, in fact, we no longer see dust particles floating through the air when the sun shines in! I have a friend that is allergic to my dog and cat. Before, she would be in the house for 1 hour before her eyes would start to go red, itch and start watering. After the installation, she spent 5 hours in the house before there was any reaction at all! I knew that she would be a good test for the filter system, but even I was pleasantly surprised at the dramatic difference the HEPA system has made for us. In previous years, when the air conditioner comes on, the air becomes really stale in the house. This year, with the air conditioner on, it&#39;s no longer stale. The air quality has really improved. My son who was away at college when we had the system installed is now home. He has trouble with allergies also so this summer we will see how he does. I have every confidence he will have a much better year this year! <br>
Thanks! Mrs. Sharon VanSchyndel<br>

We just wanted to thank you for suggesting the IQ Air Perfect 16 System and the Aquaspace Water System to us. They have truly changed our lives. After the install of the IQ Air was complete it took only minutes to see an improvement on the particulates meter and that next hour felt like a crisp, clean mountain breeze blew through the house. We could actually feel the difference with each breath, which was way more than we expected. With each day we feel the improvement, especially during this our worst allergy season, and although it seems the norm more and more we still remember life without IQ Air and wouldnt go back to that for anything. We are also very happy with the Aquaspace water system not just because we no longer have to buy bottles of water, but because it tastes so good. We miss it when we are away from home and take it with us when possible. <br>
<br>
Your technologies clearly work as we have seen at our place of business, where we first met, and you greatly improved the office air quality for all of our employees. And now in our home which is now a welcomed sanctuary from the harsh, polluted, allergenic air outside. Well done! Our health is worth the cost of improving it. We are spreading the good word about all Purahome Inc. has to offer. <br>
Sincerely, Laura and Chris Van Grieken <br>

Its absolutely unbelievable. I cant believe the difference. We have a mold issue in the basement and remediation is likely necessary, around $30 000. I have been heavy headed when waking up. Its almost like waking up with a hangover. I struggle to get my work done in my office. I just dont have enough energy. I am sluggish. A good analogy is like trying to move under water. The next morning after the air units were turned on, I woke up with energy. I felt so much better. I have even been sleeping less because I have more energy and waking up feeling better. I am a lot more alert, a lot more energetic. Ive gotten work done that hasnt been done in months. I was able to work all weekend. I have had so much energy. I feel great. I cant believe the difference the systems have made. My breathing has improved. I feel like it has been years since I have been able to breathe this way. Now I realize just how difficult my breathing has been the last few months. I cant believe it. Actually, my first indication was my pets. My male cat is afraid of everything. He slept near the one unit for the first two days! The cats are acting so playful. They are jumping 3 feet from the ground to chase a toy. The musty smell from the lower level was on my cats. Within one day, that smell was gone from them. On day 2, they showed playful behaviour. They have more energy and are much more playful. I just cant believe the difference in the air quality in my home. The odour is gone. One word to describe my home is fresh. The air is simply fresh when it used to be musty! I take everything with a grain of salt but these systems have lived up to everything you said it would. I really appreciate everything Purahome has done for me. I will be telling everyone about you. <br>
Thank you for all your help. Christa Fraser<br>

My congestion is so bad that I wake up in the middle of the night because I cannot breathe through my nose. I then have to rely on medicine to open my passageways. <br>
By the second night, after purchasing our Winix PlasmaWave Air cleaners, I was able to sleep through the night without waking up! I cannot remember the last time this has happened. I woke up being able to breathe through my nose. My right nostril was completely open and I only had some partial congestion in my left nostril. <br>
The particle levels when tested by Purahome were much better. Within 30 minutes, the air in our main floor was more than 50% cleaner! The units have really helped me. We are very happy with them. We are very happy with our cleaner air! <br>

Our 3 and 5 year olds, Christina and Alyssa, wouldnt drink water. As soon as Christina tried the Aquaspace water she said Yumeee! Now she chooses to drink water over juice every night! <br>

My nose starts to run during the night and I have to wake up. Once I am awake, I do not fall back asleep. The very first night with our Winix air cleaner in my bedroom was the first night that I can remember that I slept through the night! My husband also! Even though he has no sensitivities, he felt the air was better. <br>

Thank-you so much for our new air filter! You installed it last Saturday morning, and by Saturday night we already noticed a major difference in the air in the house. The most startling change is that I haven&#39;t been booted out of bed by my wife in the middle of the night for snoring since you installed it! To understand how significant this is, let me just say that she sleeps lightly, and prior to the installation of the filter I would get elbowed four nights out of five at some point in the night and end up moving to the guest bedroom so that she could sleep. That hasn&#39;t happened once since you&#39;ve installed the filter. Secondly, each morning I wake up breathing through my nose, not my mouth -- again, this is a new experience for me and it sure feels great! Our son is a special needs kid (he has Downs Syndrome) and his sinuses have become a lot more clear already in the first week we&#39;ve had it. Thirdly, we have an old house, and some rooms often used to smell a bit musty. A closet with my shoes in it often smelled like -- well, old shoes! The mustiness and old shoe smell have disappeared. My wife and I are both allergic to mold and mildew, and in the past the air on some days would make our lungs ache a bit. Again, the lung achiness has simply gone away, even though we have certainly had a number of warm and humid days since you installed the Hepa filter. So we are very happy customers. <br>
Thanks again! All the best,Gordon, Holly and family <br>

The water purification system is in and we have noticed a difference. The dishes are shinier, the laundry is softer and the drinking water is delicious. We won&#39;t have to buy water anymore. <br>
Thank you. Pat Smeaton<br>

I suffer with seasonal and dust mite allergens and am very sensitive to weather changes. There has been no solution to my ongoing problems with my health. Awhile ago I bought an air purifier, but was so disappointed with it. It was so inefficient and did not make any difference in how I felt. I have resorted to taking allergy pills such as Reactin and am on puffers to experience only temporary relief. <br>
I was recently introduced to the Winix air purifier. Although I was skeptical about it because of my past experiences, I borrowed one to try out before purchasing it. It was like a miracle. I knew after one night of testing it out in my bedroom that it made a difference and I purchased one. Thanks to Winix, I am sleeping throughout the night. My breathing is normal and I no longer cough. Not only has it helped me out immensely, but my family has also benefited from it. My child also suffers from asthma. It is amazing that there are no coughing sounds in my house when there used to be continuous coughing. <br>
Now that Im sleeping well, I am more energetic when at work and it has also helped with my physical fitness. (I enjoy being very active!) I used to be dependent on my medication and puffers and now, only occasionally when I am outside do I need to use my ventilin puffer. I no longer need my steroid puffer and I am so thrilled about that. I am amazed that I can buy such an incredible air purifier that works for such an excellent price. <br>

 I think Purahome is wonderful! They have been so nice to us. They made every visit so personalized. I just love our water! It is so different now. Its a brand new experience for us. At first, we thought it would be too costly, but now we are so thankful we went with the system we did. It is so well worth it! Water is such an important part of our lives, and now we can really enjoy it. I feel and know it is safe, whereas before I would avoid drinking it. Not only do I enjoy the taste of our water, I noticed right away that I no longer get the scum marks on my toilets. Also, I really noticed a difference in the colour of our water especially when I fill my bathtub. It used to be a pale yellow colour. Now I just love my baths maybe using too much water now! Im going to tell everyone I know about Purahome and our water system. We are so pleased and couldnt be happier! <br>
Thank you! Mrs. Fern Halliday <br>

 We are very happy with the air! We find it so much easier to breathe now in our work environment. In running my denture clinic, I developed a lingering dry cough. Whenever my wife would push gently on my chest, it forced me to cough. Ever since the install of our HRV and HEPA in our Denture Clinic, my dry cough has disappeared! I feel better. Odours and chemical vapours from the lab and also the eating area would permeate into the front customer waiting room. This problem no longer exists because of the air exchange and air distribution designed by Purahome for inside our clinic. I also noticed another benefit. By the end of the working day, I used to have to wipe my eyes to remove the particle buildup from my tear-drop glands. Now, at the end of the working day, I no longer have this issue! <br>

We never would open our windows because we wanted to keep dirt and dust out of our home. We also kept the doors going into the living and dining rooms closed because the air in these rooms was very stale. Once PURAHOME installed the HEPA filter, we noticed a difference the next morning. The air in the house was fresher. The doors in the living and dining rooms now stay open! <br>

We are very happy with our drinking water. It really tastes good. Were drinking more water now. We also really like our shower filter. When I wash my hair, it feels like it was done in a salon. Our skin feels softer too. This is the first winter where my husband has not suffered from facial dry skin (a condition called rosecea). <br>
Mrs. Terry Parker<br>
<br>
<br>
We saw a difference. The next day, we didnt see any particles in the air when the sun shined in through the windows. <br>

I would definitely recommend it to anyone! The air is so clear and clean. Our model home visitors comment on the air. There are no fibres from the carpet in the air. There seems to be no dust. You can definitely tell. <br>

 In June of last year, my wife and I purchased an air exchanger and HEPA air filter for our new home from Mario at Purahome. We feel that this purchase has proven to be one of the best investments weve made for our house. There were several factors that prompted us to search for a suitable air exchanger and filter: 1) Being a newly built home, we found that there was a lot of condensation that was accumulating on our window sills in winter and the air in the house generally seemed too damp. 2) Both of us are allergy sufferers and wanted to cut down on the amount of dust and allergens in the air. It was quite astonishing  within hours of the system being installed in our house, we noticed an immediate difference. The air seemed cleaner and fresher. Also, the amount of dust in our home has decreased. We have been monitoring the window sills in our home this past winter, and not surprisingly, we have not had the same problems as we had last winter before the system was installed. My wife and I both feel that the investment we made in this system has greatly improved the quality of the air inside our home. We would recommend the system that we purchased to any homeowner. More importantly, I would also highly recommend Mario and Purahome  the level of service that we have received from this company has been amazing. <br>

 We talked to several companies but the WaterMax was the most impressive system by far. Another reason we chose Purahome was because of the service we were confident they would provide in establishing that there would be issues that would need to be dealt with as they came up. We are extremely pleased with the quality of water and the installation considering all the challenges inherent in our well water as well as keeping a focus on the aesthetics of our winery. We are also very happy with the whole systems ability to have an adequate supply of treated water for us during our busy times. We are exceptionally pleased! <br>

 There is a definite difference in our air. Our home is fresher. My wife is not a good sleeper and wakes up during the middle of the night. We went away for holidays after the install was done. Ever since we have been back, she has been sleeping soundly and without waking up through out the night. We appreciate the experience with Mario. He was not pushy. He educated me on indoor air quality. He did not down play any competition. He is not just a salesman. He is very educated and has the proper background. He really knows his stuff. We also appreciate the time taken to come back to our home after the installation. Our air was tested and the results were great. The systems were explained again thoroughly. I know I will always get my questions answered and my systems serviced when required. Thank you. <br>

I&#39;ve had my Water filters for more then a year now and could not be more satisfied. I cant believe how clean the water tastes. The difference was immediately apparent when I first installed my filters and since then other people have noticed the difference as well. The difference has been so apparent that any time I&#39;ve brought water to social events; picnics, camping, etc. someone always comments on how good the water is. And, I have the peace of mind that harmful bacteria will not penetrate my drinking water. Mario from PURAHOME took the time to listen to my concerns and answer my questions before making any recommendation. My filters arrived in less then a week and took literally 5 minutes to install! From service to product quality, PURAHOME has superceeded my expectations! <br>

The water is ten times better then the previous pitcher we used to use. Theres a really big difference. The showers are awesome! <br>
Mr. Dave Howe<br>
<br>
<br>
I cant believe the difference in our water! The other system just wasnt working. The rotten egg smell in the water is now completely gone. We used to get a slimy feeling from our water when ever we bathed and that too is now gone. The water is not only odour free, its colour free. The orange colour in the water has also been eliminated. Another great benefit is the water pressure. Its like 100% better! We are so confident in the water now, we are going to stop buying bottled water. <br>

Why did I choose you...well you gave me a good price to start with but you know your stuff, and you seem to replace &quot;pressure-sales&quot; with solid information on the issues at hand. Most customers have the smarts to at least recognize that they are missing some information based on what is given, your personal technique is to not leave customers that impression. I walked away with the feeling that I actually learned something...and that is the big point in establishing that relationship of trust....especially when a big price-tag is involved. I could not get my questions answered by the other company. I am really glad we talked. I&#39;d say that your approach should allow you to walk away with a deal (over your competitors) the majority of the time. Other than that, the Hague warranty is huge....and therefore is a big endorsement by you on the quality of the product. <br>

My lifestyle has improved. I sleep better at night. The purity of the air has given me more comfortable and longer sleeping times. There is a freshness in the air creating a very pleasant atmosphere. There has been a definite decline in my asthma symptoms. I less frequently need my steroid medication. My breathing has improved. My breathing scores that I record with a peak flow meter show an increase in volume. I have had a good year for asthma. Visitors even comment when they walk in to my home. They notice right away that the air is clean and crisp in the house. The Aquaspace system has really improved my water. My drinking water now has a nice, refreshing taste. I really enjoy it as a drink. I fill a pitcher and keep it in the fridge. I no longer buy bottled water. My coffee does not seem to taste as bitter. Its great for making beverages. The shower filter has eliminated the itchy skin feeling I used to get. It has not come back since. I am a very satisfied customer. <br>
Mr. Bob Grand<br>

 I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for the outstanding service and products (HEPA system and water purification system) you provided Dina and myself. Your products exceeded our expectations; we can now wake up to a fresh aromatic house and drink safe, clean, refreshing water from our water system. This summer we have entertained quite a few people (family &amp; friends) and everyone has been extremely impressed with both systems. I truly believe your products are great, however, your personalized service is EXCELLENT. The Purahome team should be proud of backing quality products and providing exceptional customer service. Whenever we have called your office, you have answered our complicated questions and given us instantaneous service. Dina and I are very pleased to have purchased products from Purahome Inc. and we would gladly recommend your products to anyone and everyone. Keep up the great work! <br>
Sincerely, Tony Verrelli <br>

My wife noticed a difference immediately in the bedroom. The Winix kept the dust levels down and the air feels clearer. Now that we know, we have bought an additional unit! <br>

We have 2 dogs that sleep in our bedroom right on our bed. The air in the bedroom is now considerably better! When the dogs come in from playing outside, especially now in the Spring, they bring in an earthy smell. With our Winix unit, the smell is not observable. We had bought many air filters, but none have been this good! I am sneezing a lot less! There is less dust. <br>

I am so thrilled with the Winix portables that I purchased from Purahome. I bought one for my daughter who suffers from asthma, has two cats and lives with someone who smokes inside the apartment. Her first night of having the purifier, she woke up without a sore throat and breathing clearly not through her mouth but her nose. To know my daughter is finally experiencing relief is worth a million dollars. Thanks to Purahome and Winix, I can now have peace of mind. <br>
For myself, I struggle with allergies and my sinuses. The biggest most important benefit for me of the Winix unit is there is a lightness in the air. The air went from being dense, heavy and me feeling every breath to feeling light and my lungs are completely opened up. With the Winix unit, I no longer have to struggle to breath like breathing through a straw and my sinuses have completely cleared up. With allergies, I normally feel clamed up and now my breathing is so much easier and not laboured. <br>
In our Special Education classroom, the area where the Winix unit is running, there are medically fragile students who have serious respiratory challenges. They too are experiencing relief because what would normally hinder their breathing is now eliminated by the purifier. Staff cant believe how the odour that seems to always linger in this room is no longer there. <br>

              </h4>
           
              In many, many offices, where employees complain of fatigue, sickness easily spreading from one worker to another, allergies, headaches, odours and even nausea, Purahome&#39;s carefully selcted air purifers coupled with Purahome&#39;s filtration formulas for sizing systems has resulted in great results. For example, we were told that many workers at First Ontario Credit Union were able to eliminate completely or reduce their allergy medications in half within a couple of days. We have many successful installations in challenging environments that are a result of thorough air and/or water testing and analysis as well as occupant analysis for existing health issues and concerns. The Cotton Cement Processing Plant has indoor air that now has lower particulate levels than outdoor air! We also believe and have been told by several wineries that Flat Rock Cellars Winery is the only winery run on well water. Several factors including water quality, aesthetics, limited space, and applications needed in the wine-making process had to be considered to successfully treat and provide water for the entire facility. Ontario Power Generation sent in a list of chemicals they use in a certain room with a couple of employees, and based on the chemicals used, Purahome provided a specific air cleaner designed to remove the volatile chemicals in that unique environement. Every satisified customer is the result of meticulously selected product and Purahome&#39;s scientific process to best help determine which technologies are best-suited for our customers.

              Purahome Inc. is very pleased with the feedback that has been received from our customers. Here is a brief sample of what some of them had to say.<br>
<br>
<br>
In January we had the HEPA system installed in our home , and what a difference it has made for us! Dust levels are dramatically reduced, in fact, we no longer see dust particles floating through the air when the sun shines in! I have a friend that is allergic to my dog and cat. Before, she would be in the house for 1 hour before her eyes would start to go red, itch and start watering. After the installation, she spent 5 hours in the house before there was any reaction at all! I knew that she would be a good test for the filter system, but even I was pleasantly surprised at the dramatic difference the HEPA system has made for us. In previous years, when the air conditioner comes on, the air becomes really stale in the house. This year, with the air conditioner on, it&#39;s no longer stale. The air quality has really improved. My son who was away at college when we had the system installed is now home. He has trouble with allergies also so this summer we will see how he does. I have every confidence he will have a much better year this year! <br>
Thanks! Mrs. Sharon VanSchyndel<br>

We just wanted to thank you for suggesting the IQ Air Perfect 16 System and the Aquaspace Water System to us. They have truly changed our lives. After the install of the IQ Air was complete it took only minutes to see an improvement on the particulates meter and that next hour felt like a crisp, clean mountain breeze blew through the house. We could actually feel the difference with each breath, which was way more than we expected. With each day we feel the improvement, especially during this our worst allergy season, and although it seems the norm more and more we still remember life without IQ Air and wouldnt go back to that for anything. We are also very happy with the Aquaspace water system not just because we no longer have to buy bottles of water, but because it tastes so good. We miss it when we are away from home and take it with us when possible. <br>
<br>
Your technologies clearly work as we have seen at our place of business, where we first met, and you greatly improved the office air quality for all of our employees. And now in our home which is now a welcomed sanctuary from the harsh, polluted, allergenic air outside. Well done! Our health is worth the cost of improving it. We are spreading the good word about all Purahome Inc. has to offer. <br>
Sincerely, Laura and Chris Van Grieken <br>

Its absolutely unbelievable. I cant believe the difference. We have a mold issue in the basement and remediation is likely necessary, around $30 000. I have been heavy headed when waking up. Its almost like waking up with a hangover. I struggle to get my work done in my office. I just dont have enough energy. I am sluggish. A good analogy is like trying to move under water. The next morning after the air units were turned on, I woke up with energy. I felt so much better. I have even been sleeping less because I have more energy and waking up feeling better. I am a lot more alert, a lot more energetic. Ive gotten work done that hasnt been done in months. I was able to work all weekend. I have had so much energy. I feel great. I cant believe the difference the systems have made. My breathing has improved. I feel like it has been years since I have been able to breathe this way. Now I realize just how difficult my breathing has been the last few months. I cant believe it. Actually, my first indication was my pets. My male cat is afraid of everything. He slept near the one unit for the first two days! The cats are acting so playful. They are jumping 3 feet from the ground to chase a toy. The musty smell from the lower level was on my cats. Within one day, that smell was gone from them. On day 2, they showed playful behaviour. They have more energy and are much more playful. I just cant believe the difference in the air quality in my home. The odour is gone. One word to describe my home is fresh. The air is simply fresh when it used to be musty! I take everything with a grain of salt but these systems have lived up to everything you said it would. I really appreciate everything Purahome has done for me. I will be telling everyone about you. <br>
Thank you for all your help. Christa Fraser<br>

My congestion is so bad that I wake up in the middle of the night because I cannot breathe through my nose. I then have to rely on medicine to open my passageways. <br>
By the second night, after purchasing our Winix PlasmaWave Air cleaners, I was able to sleep through the night without waking up! I cannot remember the last time this has happened. I woke up being able to breathe through my nose. My right nostril was completely open and I only had some partial congestion in my left nostril. <br>
The particle levels when tested by Purahome were much better. Within 30 minutes, the air in our main floor was more than 50% cleaner! The units have really helped me. We are very happy with them. We are very happy with our cleaner air! <br>

Our 3 and 5 year olds, Christina and Alyssa, wouldnt drink water. As soon as Christina tried the Aquaspace water she said Yumeee! Now she chooses to drink water over juice every night! <br>
Mr. Mike Weber<br>
<br>
<br>
My nose starts to run during the night and I have to wake up. Once I am awake, I do not fall back asleep. The very first night with our Winix air cleaner in my bedroom was the first night that I can remember that I slept through the night! My husband also! Even though he has no sensitivities, he felt the air was better. <br>

Thank-you so much for our new air filter! You installed it last Saturday morning, and by Saturday night we already noticed a major difference in the air in the house. The most startling change is that I haven&#39;t been booted out of bed by my wife in the middle of the night for snoring since you installed it! To understand how significant this is, let me just say that she sleeps lightly, and prior to the installation of the filter I would get elbowed four nights out of five at some point in the night and end up moving to the guest bedroom so that she could sleep. That hasn&#39;t happened once since you&#39;ve installed the filter. Secondly, each morning I wake up breathing through my nose, not my mouth -- again, this is a new experience for me and it sure feels great! Our son is a special needs kid (he has Downs Syndrome) and his sinuses have become a lot more clear already in the first week we&#39;ve had it. Thirdly, we have an old house, and some rooms often used to smell a bit musty. A closet with my shoes in it often smelled like -- well, old shoes! The mustiness and old shoe smell have disappeared. My wife and I are both allergic to mold and mildew, and in the past the air on some days would make our lungs ache a bit. Again, the lung achiness has simply gone away, even though we have certainly had a number of warm and humid days since you installed the Hepa filter. So we are very happy customers. <br>
Thanks again! All the best,Gordon, Holly and family <br>

The water purification system is in and we have noticed a difference. The dishes are shinier, the laundry is softer and the drinking water is delicious. We won&#39;t have to buy water anymore. <br>
Thank you. Pat Smeaton<br>

I suffer with seasonal and dust mite allergens and am very sensitive to weather changes. There has been no solution to my ongoing problems with my health. Awhile ago I bought an air purifier, but was so disappointed with it. It was so inefficient and did not make any difference in how I felt. I have resorted to taking allergy pills such as Reactin and am on puffers to experience only temporary relief. <br>
I was recently introduced to the Winix air purifier. Although I was skeptical about it because of my past experiences, I borrowed one to try out before purchasing it. It was like a miracle. I knew after one night of testing it out in my bedroom that it made a difference and I purchased one. Thanks to Winix, I am sleeping throughout the night. My breathing is normal and I no longer cough. Not only has it helped me out immensely, but my family has also benefited from it. My child also suffers from asthma. It is amazing that there are no coughing sounds in my house when there used to be continuous coughing. <br>
Now that Im sleeping well, I am more energetic when at work and it has also helped with my physical fitness. (I enjoy being very active!) I used to be dependent on my medication and puffers and now, only occasionally when I am outside do I need to use my ventilin puffer. I no longer need my steroid puffer and I am so thrilled about that. I am amazed that I can buy such an incredible air purifier that works for such an excellent price. <br>

 I think Purahome is wonderful! They have been so nice to us. They made every visit so personalized. I just love our water! It is so different now. Its a brand new experience for us. At first, we thought it would be too costly, but now we are so thankful we went with the system we did. It is so well worth it! Water is such an important part of our lives, and now we can really enjoy it. I feel and know it is safe, whereas before I would avoid drinking it. Not only do I enjoy the taste of our water, I noticed right away that I no longer get the scum marks on my toilets. Also, I really noticed a difference in the colour of our water especially when I fill my bathtub. It used to be a pale yellow colour. Now I just love my baths maybe using too much water now! Im going to tell everyone I know about Purahome and our water system. We are so pleased and couldnt be happier! <br>
Thank you! Mrs. Fern Halliday <br>

 We are very happy with the air! We find it so much easier to breathe now in our work environment. In running my denture clinic, I developed a lingering dry cough. Whenever my wife would push gently on my chest, it forced me to cough. Ever since the install of our HRV and HEPA in our Denture Clinic, my dry cough has disappeared! I feel better. Odours and chemical vapours from the lab and also the eating area would permeate into the front customer waiting room. This problem no longer exists because of the air exchange and air distribution designed by Purahome for inside our clinic. I also noticed another benefit. By the end of the working day, I used to have to wipe my eyes to remove the particle buildup from my tear-drop glands. Now, at the end of the working day, I no longer have this issue! <br>

We never would open our windows because we wanted to keep dirt and dust out of our home. We also kept the doors going into the living and dining rooms closed because the air in these rooms was very stale. Once PURAHOME installed the HEPA filter, we noticed a difference the next morning. The air in the house was fresher. The doors in the living and dining rooms now stay open! <br>

We are very happy with our drinking water. It really tastes good. Were drinking more water now. We also really like our shower filter. When I wash my hair, it feels like it was done in a salon. Our skin feels softer too. This is the first winter where my husband has not suffered from facial dry skin (a condition called rosecea). <br>

We saw a difference. The next day, we didnt see any particles in the air when the sun shined in through the windows. <br>

I would definitely recommend it to anyone! The air is so clear and clean. Our model home visitors comment on the air. There are no fibres from the carpet in the air. There seems to be no dust. You can definitely tell. <br>

 In June of last year, my wife and I purchased an air exchanger and HEPA air filter for our new home from Mario at Purahome. We feel that this purchase has proven to be one of the best investments weve made for our house. There were several factors that prompted us to search for a suitable air exchanger and filter: 1) Being a newly built home, we found that there was a lot of condensation that was accumulating on our window sills in winter and the air in the house generally seemed too damp. 2) Both of us are allergy sufferers and wanted to cut down on the amount of dust and allergens in the air. It was quite astonishing  within hours of the system being installed in our house, we noticed an immediate difference. The air seemed cleaner and fresher. Also, the amount of dust in our home has decreased. We have been monitoring the window sills in our home this past winter, and not surprisingly, we have not had the same problems as we had last winter before the system was installed. My wife and I both feel that the investment we made in this system has greatly improved the quality of the air inside our home. We would recommend the system that we purchased to any homeowner. More importantly, I would also highly recommend Mario and Purahome  the level of service that we have received from this company has been amazing. <br>

 We talked to several companies but the WaterMax was the most impressive system by far. Another reason we chose Purahome was because of the service we were confident they would provide in establishing that there would be issues that would need to be dealt with as they came up. We are extremely pleased with the quality of water and the installation considering all the challenges inherent in our well water as well as keeping a focus on the aesthetics of our winery. We are also very happy with the whole systems ability to have an adequate supply of treated water for us during our busy times. We are exceptionally pleased! <br>

 There is a definite difference in our air. Our home is fresher. My wife is not a good sleeper and wakes up during the middle of the night. We went away for holidays after the install was done. Ever since we have been back, she has been sleeping soundly and without waking up through out the night. We appreciate the experience with Mario. He was not pushy. He educated me on indoor air quality. He did not down play any competition. He is not just a salesman. He is very educated and has the proper background. He really knows his stuff. We also appreciate the time taken to come back to our home after the installation. Our air was tested and the results were great. The systems were explained again thoroughly. I know I will always get my questions answered and my systems serviced when required. Thank you. <br>

I&#39;ve had my Water filters for more then a year now and could not be more satisfied. I cant believe how clean the water tastes. The difference was immediately apparent when I first installed my filters and since then other people have noticed the difference as well. The difference has been so apparent that any time I&#39;ve brought water to social events; picnics, camping, etc. someone always comments on how good the water is. And, I have the peace of mind that harmful bacteria will not penetrate my drinking water. Mario from PURAHOME took the time to listen to my concerns and answer my questions before making any recommendation. My filters arrived in less then a week and took literally 5 minutes to install! From service to product quality, PURAHOME has superceeded my expectations! <br>

The water is ten times better then the previous pitcher we used to use. Theres a really big difference. The showers are awesome! <br>
Mr. Dave Howe<br>

I cant believe the difference in our water! The other system just wasnt working. The rotten egg smell in the water is now completely gone. We used to get a slimy feeling from our water when ever we bathed and that too is now gone. The water is not only odour free, its colour free. The orange colour in the water has also been eliminated. Another great benefit is the water pressure. Its like 100% better! We are so confident in the water now, we are going to stop buying bottled water. <br>

Why did I choose you...well you gave me a good price to start with but you know your stuff, and you seem to replace &quot;pressure-sales&quot; with solid information on the issues at hand. Most customers have the smarts to at least recognize that they are missing some information based on what is given, your personal technique is to not leave customers that impression. I walked away with the feeling that I actually learned something...and that is the big point in establishing that relationship of trust....especially when a big price-tag is involved. I could not get my questions answered by the other company. I am really glad we talked. I&#39;d say that your approach should allow you to walk away with a deal (over your competitors) the majority of the time. Other than that, the Hague warranty is huge....and therefore is a big endorsement by you on the quality of the product. <br>

My lifestyle has improved. I sleep better at night. The purity of the air has given me more comfortable and longer sleeping times. There is a freshness in the air creating a very pleasant atmosphere. There has been a definite decline in my asthma symptoms. I less frequently need my steroid medication. My breathing has improved. My breathing scores that I record with a peak flow meter show an increase in volume. I have had a good year for asthma. Visitors even comment when they walk in to my home. They notice right away that the air is clean and crisp in the house. The Aquaspace system has really improved my water. My drinking water now has a nice, refreshing taste. I really enjoy it as a drink. I fill a pitcher and keep it in the fridge. I no longer buy bottled water. My coffee does not seem to taste as bitter. Its great for making beverages. The shower filter has eliminated the itchy skin feeling I used to get. It has not come back since. I am a very satisfied customer. <br>

 I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for the outstanding service and products (HEPA system and water purification system) you provided Dina and myself. Your products exceeded our expectations; we can now wake up to a fresh aromatic house and drink safe, clean, refreshing water from our water system. This summer we have entertained quite a few people (family &amp; friends) and everyone has been extremely impressed with both systems. I truly believe your products are great, however, your personalized service is EXCELLENT. The Purahome team should be proud of backing quality products and providing exceptional customer service. Whenever we have called your office, you have answered our complicated questions and given us instantaneous service. Dina and I are very pleased to have purchased products from Purahome Inc. and we would gladly recommend your products to anyone and everyone. Keep up the great work! <br>
Sincerely, Tony Verrelli <br>

My wife noticed a difference immediately in the bedroom. The Winix kept the dust levels down and the air feels clearer. Now that we know, we have bought an additional unit! <br>

We have 2 dogs that sleep in our bedroom right on our bed. The air in the bedroom is now considerably better! When the dogs come in from playing outside, especially now in the Spring, they bring in an earthy smell. With our Winix unit, the smell is not observable. We had bought many air filters, but none have been this good! I am sneezing a lot less! There is less dust. <br>

I am so thrilled with the Winix portables that I purchased from Purahome. I bought one for my daughter who suffers from asthma, has two cats and lives with someone who smokes inside the apartment. Her first night of having the purifier, she woke up without a sore throat and breathing clearly not through her mouth but her nose. To know my daughter is finally experiencing relief is worth a million dollars. Thanks to Purahome and Winix, I can now have peace of mind. <br>
For myself, I struggle with allergies and my sinuses. The biggest most important benefit for me of the Winix unit is there is a lightness in the air. The air went from being dense, heavy and me feeling every breath to feeling light and my lungs are completely opened up. With the Winix unit, I no longer have to struggle to breath like breathing through a straw and my sinuses have completely cleared up. With allergies, I normally feel clamed up and now my breathing is so much easier and not laboured. <br>
In our Special Education classroom, the area where the Winix unit is running, there are medically fragile students who have serious respiratory challenges. They too are experiencing relief because what would normally hinder their breathing is now eliminated by the purifier. Staff cant believe how the odour that seems to always linger in this room is no longer there. <br>
