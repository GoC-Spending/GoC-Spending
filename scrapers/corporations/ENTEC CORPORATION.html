        <br>            Entec Corporation is recognized for being on the cutting edge of measuring employee satisfaction, employee engagement, employee emotional well-being and leadership. We now offer all of these surveys for free at www.EmployeeSurveyToolkit.com in a fully automated format. The system is very easy to use but provides detailed reports for location, organizational units down to departments, job levels, job categories, union/non union, demographics etc. The user chooses the data cuts. These are available instantly both during the survey process as well as at the end. Results are shown in tables as well as pie charts-all instantly. This is an amazing technology and its all for free.<br>  <br>  Employee performance is affected by several components most <br>notably: how employees feel towards their company, managers, immediate work environment and employee support of company values. These are the dimensions typically measured by most research firms.    A component that is not measured and that has a significant impact on an employee&#39;s performance is the employee&#39;s emotional/psuchological make up. Recognizing this additional component, and the desire to view employee engagement from a holistic perspective, Entec assembled a team comprising experts in strategic management, leadership, organizational development, psychiatry, medicine and behavioural psychology to develop a comprehensive diagnostic to measure employee engagement. A new diagnostic was developed to measure both organizational factors and employee emotional wellness. The diagnostic is called the Employee Engagement &amp; Individual Health Survey©. <br><br>Our surveys are available in French and English. <br><br>

Dear Michael<br>
<br>
When I received the Employee Engagement Report I was thrilled because for the first time since we had been running employee surveys (Provided by large well know survey companies), I could instantly see what the results meant, what needed to be done, by whom and where.<br>
<br>
I was extremely pleased with the high participation rate because our employee profile is a veritable United Nations. In addition, like all large pharmaceutical companies, we had employees at every level of education: PH.D?s. in research down to high school graduates in our packaging departments and our loading docks to everything else in between. The survey was comprehensive and yet simple to complete. The clarity of the results and recommendations allowed us to move quickly and decisively with follow up programs.<br>
<br>
President, Novopharm<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gap Inc. Canada has partnered with Entec since 1999 to customize, implement, analyze and then action a compelling organizational health survey. I have reviewed and used many employee satisfaction instruments, but none were as comprehensive, accurate or as linked to improving both business results and employee commitment as this one.<br>
<br>
Gap Inc. Canada<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Entec&#39;s employee engagement survey enabled our organization to elevate the level of senior management discussions on proactive employee management. The tool provided actionable information that allowed us to identify leadership development initiatives for the benefit of our management group and the organization.<br>
<br>
Its multidimensional view of what affects employee motivation provided new insights on what an organization can do to influence employee engagement. It led to the development of both corporate and management level initiatives that will have a significant impact on the wellbeing of our employees. I am convinced these initiatives will increase the ability and the desire of our employees to help our organization set new standards in customer satisfaction.<br>
<br>
President &amp; CEO, Atlantic Blue Cross Care<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Over the past three years, Entec Corporation has provided our Human Resources team with professional and personalized services in our ongoing efforts to promote organizational health and employee engagement.<br>
<br>
Recognized as a &quot;Top 100 Employer&quot; in Canada for four years in a row, Georgian College is noted for its &quot;people friendly&quot; and supportive management practices. The Entec Organizational Health &amp; Employee Engagement survey provided us with a tool to monitor the positive impact of those practices. It also clearly showed us how and where we could improve.<br>
<br>
Vice-President, Georgian College<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to let you know how impressed I was with the report that was generated by the employee engagement survey. It identified areas needing improvement in my company with pin point accuracy.<br>
<br>
I was also impressed with the simple and non-disruptive method of its application. I know that some employees completed the survey in the office while others completed it after work at home.<br>
<br>
I was amazed at the thoroughness and detail provided by the survey report. It would have taken a traditional consultant anywhere from 3-4 months to provide the same level of detail. Entec did in only three weeks after you received the last survey and you did it at a third of the cost.<br>
<br>
President, ATC-Frost Magnetics Inc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for introducing us to Entec?s employee engagement survey. As you are aware, we have a well-established process of on-going improvement. The survey results validated that we had made significant progress over the past year and identified what we still had to do.<br>
<br>
The engagement survey helped us focus on the areas where we had not made as much progress as we would have liked to have made. The survey results showed that the most significant area needing improvement was the performance of our IT group. We have purchased a new computer that will compliment our existing servers. It will be in place in early February and we will see a significant improvement in reliability and speed. We have established other follow up activities to address all other issues identified.<br>
<br>
Michael, your process works. It helps set priorities on ongoing improvements. As discussed, providing additional graphics displaying the results at the lower levels would be helpful.<br>

<br>
I selected Entec Corporation to provide me with the information that I urgently needed at London Hydro to better identify and evaluate ways of improving employee morale and productivity.<br>
<br>
The Entec Organizational Health &amp; Employee Engagement survey provided me with a fast picture of ?Where I am today? with a view that started at the top and cascaded down the organization. It showed how effectively each department and hence the company was functioning relative to predefined key performance criteria.<br>
<br>
Through the application of this survey I have gained new and useful insights into both the company and my coworkers which will enable us all to grow more quickly and effectively into a competitively customer oriented company. <br>

Dear Michael<br>
<br>
When I received the Employee Engagement Report I was thrilled because for the first time since we had been running employee surveys (Provided by large well know survey companies), I could instantly see what the results meant, what needed to be done, by whom and where.<br>
<br>
I was extremely pleased with the high participation rate because our employee profile is a veritable United Nations. In addition, like all large pharmaceutical companies, we had employees at every level of education: PH.D?s. in research down to high school graduates in our packaging departments and our loading docks to everything else in between. The survey was comprehensive and yet simple to complete. The clarity of the results and recommendations allowed us to move quickly and decisively with follow up programs.<br>
<br>
President, Novopharm<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gap Inc. Canada has partnered with Entec since 1999 to customize, implement, analyze and then action a compelling organizational health survey. I have reviewed and used many employee satisfaction instruments, but none were as comprehensive, accurate or as linked to improving both business results and employee commitment as this one.<br>
<br>
Gap Inc. Canada<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Entec&#39;s employee engagement survey enabled our organization to elevate the level of senior management discussions on proactive employee management. The tool provided actionable information that allowed us to identify leadership development initiatives for the benefit of our management group and the organization.<br>
<br>
Its multidimensional view of what affects employee motivation provided new insights on what an organization can do to influence employee engagement. It led to the development of both corporate and management level initiatives that will have a significant impact on the wellbeing of our employees. I am convinced these initiatives will increase the ability and the desire of our employees to help our organization set new standards in customer satisfaction.<br>
<br>
President &amp; CEO, Atlantic Blue Cross Care<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Over the past three years, Entec Corporation has provided our Human Resources team with professional and personalized services in our ongoing efforts to promote organizational health and employee engagement.<br>
<br>
Recognized as a &quot;Top 100 Employer&quot; in Canada for four years in a row, Georgian College is noted for its &quot;people friendly&quot; and supportive management practices. The Entec Organizational Health &amp; Employee Engagement survey provided us with a tool to monitor the positive impact of those practices. It also clearly showed us how and where we could improve.<br>
<br>
Vice-President, Georgian College<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to let you know how impressed I was with the report that was generated by the employee engagement survey. It identified areas needing improvement in my company with pin point accuracy.<br>
<br>
I was also impressed with the simple and non-disruptive method of its application. I know that some employees completed the survey in the office while others completed it after work at home.<br>
<br>
I was amazed at the thoroughness and detail provided by the survey report. It would have taken a traditional consultant anywhere from 3-4 months to provide the same level of detail. Entec did in only three weeks after you received the last survey and you did it at a third of the cost.<br>
<br>
President, ATC-Frost Magnetics Inc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for introducing us to Entec?s employee engagement survey. As you are aware, we have a well-established process of on-going improvement. The survey results validated that we had made significant progress over the past year and identified what we still had to do.<br>
<br>
The engagement survey helped us focus on the areas where we had not made as much progress as we would have liked to have made. The survey results showed that the most significant area needing improvement was the performance of our IT group. We have purchased a new computer that will compliment our existing servers. It will be in place in early February and we will see a significant improvement in reliability and speed. We have established other follow up activities to address all other issues identified.<br>
<br>
Michael, your process works. It helps set priorities on ongoing improvements. As discussed, providing additional graphics displaying the results at the lower levels would be helpful.<br>

<br>
I selected Entec Corporation to provide me with the information that I urgently needed at London Hydro to better identify and evaluate ways of improving employee morale and productivity.<br>
<br>
The Entec Organizational Health &amp; Employee Engagement survey provided me with a fast picture of ?Where I am today? with a view that started at the top and cascaded down the organization. It showed how effectively each department and hence the company was functioning relative to predefined key performance criteria.<br>
<br>
Through the application of this survey I have gained new and useful insights into both the company and my coworkers which will enable us all to grow more quickly and effectively into a competitively customer oriented company. <br>
