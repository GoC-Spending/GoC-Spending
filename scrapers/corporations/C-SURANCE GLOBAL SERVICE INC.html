Service financier JDF Inc.<br>
&quot;Committing to the C-surance.ca service in 2004 was one great<br>
business decision. Thanks to the availability of MDI tools and<br>
services, we were able to substantially improve our efficiency<br>
as well as the quality of our offer while making substantial<br>
financial gains.<br>
The flexibility and the power of the technology combined with<br>
the quality of the available analysis enabled us to offer our<br>
customers distinctive value added products instead of<br>
promoting pricing only. Our customer always wins since we are<br>
able to custom fit to their very needs while providing them with<br>
competitive pricing. <br>
Jean Denis Roy, President and CEO<br>
Financial Services JDF Inc. is a leading group insurance<br>
professional advisor addressing the needs of Québec<br>
enterprises. Dynamics and forward thinking the company<br>
prides itself for providing high level Client Centric<br>
Services. Mr. Roy did not wish to build his company on<br>
offering the lowest prices, but on proposing the best<br>
price/ratio products and services that will fit the client<br>
needs.<br>
With an annual growth of more than 38%, it was obvious<br>
that selecting the right technology would be as paramount<br>
as the reputation of the provider. C-surance.ca as well<br>
as more than 26 years of dedicated services to the<br>
insurance industry made MDI the ideal choice.<br>
One of C-surance.ca characteristics is the flexibility given<br>
to the client to pick and choose the needed tools. In this<br>
case, the customer first adhered to the basic service then<br>
gradually added complementary services which responded<br>
to their specific needs. By the same token, it is possible to<br>
drop services if and when they become irrelevant.<br>
The bottom line after 2 years of use is very positive: Csurance.<br>
ca technology made it possible to reduce from<br>
three (3) to only one (1) the number of resources assigned<br>
to the preparation of RFP, analysis and specifications.<br>
The two (2) resources were reassigned to more<br>
productive and profitable marketing activities.<br>
The conversion of the existing files was carried out<br>
gradually with minimum efforts thanks to powerful Excel import/export options. The C-surance.ca<br>
technology made it possible to standardize the formats and the contents of information, but more<br>
importantly it made it possible to regroup ALL the available information within one single data<br>
base, whereby completely eliminating multiple input of the same information. As soon as the<br>
information is inputted in C-surance.ca it becomes possible to respond instantaneously and in<br>
real time to any requests coming from either the customers or the carriers.<br>
<br>
The pay as you go rating structure of C-surance.ca is very business friendly and ensures an<br>
almost instant ROI Return on Investment. Entry fees for the various services are a fraction of<br>
the traditional costs of buying a licence. Usage fees are based on the volume as well as the<br>
number of authorized accesses. Hereby, whatever the business volume, the client will pay only a<br>
fraction of the gained benefit associated with the usage of the service. Moreover, the privilege to<br>
end at any time without penalty with a short 90 days notice brings an additional guarantee of a<br>
quality of service and high level performance since MDI must, every day, earn the business.<br>
Quantitatively, the current standard at JDF for the creation of a new RFP file (average 50-100<br>
employees), electronically transmitting them to the carriers (3-8) and preparing for the client all<br>
the comprehensive comparative analysis including each of the received offers from the carriers is<br>
done in less than 3 hours. The objective is to drop this to less than 2 hours within the next the 6<br>
month. Needless to say that with the minimal invested effort it is then possible to convert the<br>
prospect into a client with the click of a mouse. Keeping information up to date or generating<br>
invoices or employer/employee contribution will be then become child play. C-surance.ca provide<br>
in real time for any or all the employees the needed combined or individual detailed reports that<br>
will reflect changes or simply what if scenarios. Calculations of the employer/employee<br>
contributions are optimized fiscally and available automatically with a few key strokes or mouse<br>
clicks.<br>
C-surance.ca has proven to be a very reliable, efficient and economically sounded partner. We<br>
have access to an A to Z tools kit that provides ALL the tools necessary to answer each of our<br>
customers request. We are always sure that whenever the need will occur, we will have access<br>
to a product or a service which will exceed our expectation and this at a cost that will be fair and<br>
competitive.<br>
MDI customer service is definitively a strong point. The experts understand our needs and those<br>
of our customers. They respond quickly and effectively our requests.<br>
With C-surance.ca the industry revolves around OUR operations. It is we who control. <br>

              IBM confirms 15 years of technological advancement for CSUSGI and $4 billion in potential saving <br>
  <br>
Laval on January 13 2007, C-surance.ca Global Service Inc/MDI (CSUGSI) is proud to take note that IBM analysts describe the «C-surance.ca Suite» as the ideal business model with which the insurance industry could renew themselves.  The model insures reduced operating costs that benefit the consumers. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
More than $7.5B   is spent annually to cover the cost of managing group benefits insurance. The C-surance.ca suite of service is the first UNIVERSAL CLIENT CENTRIC COLLABORATIVE WEB solution that guarantees group benefits insurance saving.    The simplified management processes perfectly reflects the new business model proposed by IBM. CSUGSI professionals estimate that $4B annually could be saved   once the solution   is implemented globally.   This  represent some 250$ per  person. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The IBM Institute for Business Value Study titled « Insurance 2020: Innovating beyond old models », dated May 23rd 2006, is a significant endorsement of our 10 years of R&amp;D and millions in investments said Mr. Richard Sirois, President and CEO, CSUGSI. With the evolution of the WEB technologies, MDI undertook in 2000 a total revision of the group benefits management processes and adapted these changes to its original Allegroupe software,   which had been on the market since 1995.  We put aside all the traditional paradigms of operations and reinvented each process to capitalize on the potential of emergent technologies. The report presented by the IBM professionals precisely reflects the objectives and the challenges on which our professionals invested themselves for years. CSUGSI could hardly have better described its C-surance.ca project added Mr. Sirois. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The technological and financial risks necessary to carry out its C-surance.ca project were important. But the results are impressive. The IBM report which presents the insurance model for 2020, attributes C-surance.ca 15 years of technology leadership.  Case studies show that the business works extremely well financially as an CSUGSI customer succeeded in saving annually more than $500   per employee. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
All the participants including insurers, professional benefits advisors/actuaries, sponsors/employers/trade unions/governments, health care providers and professionals   profit from this new opportunity. The largest gains go to the sponsor and therefore the consumers. We expect the sponsor to become the principal promoter of the new technology available.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
C-surance.ca proposes the service in SAAS (Software As A Service) mode simplifying the processes of implementation/integration and ensuring of new levels of effectiveness, saving as well as improving management of group insurance. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
To fully appreciate the importance of CSUGSI innovation, one can compare the C-surance.ca solution for the management of the group benefits with the revolution that the ATM brought to the banking operations. <br>

              Case Study: <br>
Syndicat des débardeurs du Port de Montréal <br>
<br>
&quot;Since 2002, we have successfully reduced our annual management fees and claims by an average of over 500$ per active employee while improving our control over information, optimizing our processes and reducing payment for unjustified claims! These savings provided us with the means to maintain intact our existing benefits, while extending new health benefits that better reflect todays needs, such as disability coverage. » Benoit Wolfe, Administrative Director of Régime de Sécurité Sociale du Syndicat des Débardeurs, SCFP section locale 375 Established for more than one hundred years, the Port of Montreal Dockers union is one of the oldest unions in the Province of Quebec. With one thousand active members and about 650 pensioners under administration and working for 5 maritime employers, the Port of Montreal Dockers union is certainly a model of a successful self administered plan managed by a union organization. In 1972, under Mr. Théodore Beaudin then president, the union began to gradually step into a self-administration plan: a trust was created to offer a uniform drugs and healthcare coverage to all active members. Later in 1990, the union negotiated and obtained from their employers a better group plan for the benefit of its members; life insurance, dental care, short and long term disability benefits were added to those already offered by the union. Beginning with a standard administrative formula assumed by carriers, in an ASO mode towards 1999, the union quickly realized that successive premium increases put seriously in danger the survival of the plan for its members. Many reasons could explain the problem: The lack of controls from carriers to claim payment, unjustified paid claims and high administrative charges, etc... In 2001, the union decided then to take care of the full administration and adjudication of its group plan, with the exception of the life insurance benefit. To do it, the union purchased C -surance.ca/Allegroupe service, a fully integrated group plan administrative system from MDI Since then, with more than 100,000 paid claims per year to members and dependents, the union manages and controls from A to Z its group plan.<br>

Amongst our most concrete benefits following the in house implementation of the MDI solution is the fact that the union is saving annually over 500,000$ since 2001. Saving is mainly credited to the following activities: - Elimination of dental and drug cards : o Expense associated with these cards varied from 4 to 40% of paid contribution. &amp;#56256;&amp;#56451; The cost of managing the partial reimbursement for retired employees of the RAMQ deductible through the drug card where costing approximately 40% of actual payout. Saving allowed an increase in the deductible reimbursement % for these members without actually adding to the available budget. &amp;#56256;&amp;#56451; Eliminating the standard 12% fee for dental and 4% for drug cards used by our active members provided additional funds to help us improve the available services. o Changing the payment model and inviting the members to pay for services before submitting claims, generated a positive modification in the purchase habit. The impact was major as it allowed for a reduction of consumption of services that where not essential. - Internal management provided with opportunities to identify weaknesses in regard with the previously available tools as well as allowed to better set up the contract configuration. These sensitive control might not have been a priority with our previous provider as they where operating under a cost plus formula. As an example: clauses that should have limited payment of denture to once every 3 or 5 years, went more often than not unnoticed by our carrier. - By having a direct access to each claim, the administrators were able to identify trends. Some of those allowed for stopping of abuses as well as potential fraudulent claims. Over and above the financial improvement for the members, the in house access and tools provided a way to improve substantially the speed of services to members. When needed, a check can be issued within a few minutes. This efficiency did not go unnoticed by none union employees that are managing the service, as their personal experience with traditional carrier can no way compare with the quality and speed the members are getting day in and day out. We can react and decide faster than before. C-surance.ca provides us with all the tools, information, reports and flexibility needed for a quick decision making. We&#39;re now in full control!!! .

              Case Study: <br>
Groupe Financier Abi-Témi Inc. <br>
&quot;Backed by an exceptional team and the best available technology in Canada, we are proud to offer innovative, cost effective, and strong value added services to our present and future clients! The ageing of the population as well as economic pressures on local companies led us to re-evaluate traditional group insurance services. We left no stone unturned in search of the most efficient business processes and tools that would give more to our clients while protecting their insurance investments. After we completed our C-surance.ca technological investments training program, we were sold. C-surance.ca was exactly what we were looking for to aid our team in offering world class services to our clients. Our clients are the winners!&quot; Mr Étienne Lambert, President<br>
<br>
Established in 1981, Groupe financier Abi-témi Inc., a life insurance and financial services firm in Rouyn Noranda, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, distinguish their company by offering higher level services and unsurpassed professionalism in the area of benefits management. In previous months, Étienne Lambert, president, and Benoit Côté, founder, literally reinvented the cabinet to capitalize on this new trend to offer companies and trade unions outstanding services that will simplify management efforts, improve access to information and reduce direct and indirect management costs. Thanks to C-surance.ca technology, Groupe financier Abi-Témi inc. now addresses the group insurance and employee benefits market with renewed confidence. With a range of innovative tools at their disposal, they are now able to look for new market opportunities. Thanks to these new technologies, the company is now able to concentrate its energy on providing unequalled service says Mr. Benoît Côté. The group benefits management processes are now standardized under a single system which automates administrative tasks while ensuring almost absolute reliability continues Mr. Côté. Mr. Côté had several opportunities to work with these new technologies thanks to Richard Sirois, president and founder of MDI. With the arrival of Mr. Lambert in June 2006, Groupe financier Abi-Témi decided to go forward with this innovative project. The implementation of this new group insurance technology is a great boost to the evolution of our profession comments Mr. Lambert. All of which benefits every segment of this industry.<br>
<br>
Thanks to these technologies, benefits managers have access to straight forward and user friendly solutions which is easy to navigate within what is normally a very complicated environment. Groupe financier Abi-Témi inc. now offers integrated management of all benefits management related activities through a single input of information, therefore reducing direct and indirect costs to clients. The legal framework for managing group insurance benefits include insurance laws, income tax laws, Civil Code, Workmans compensation, unemployment insurance, provincial and federal healthcare policies and pensions as well as other various provincial labour laws. The complexity of laws and the high risk of errors and omissions with which companies and organizations are faced with force them to seek increasingly more sophisticated services. This is the context in which C-surance.ca performs best. Groupe financier Abi-Témi Inc. called up the services of a third group benefits and pension advisor. Few brokers in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, especially in Rouyn-Noranda, can pride themselves in having three licensed group insurance representatives under their belt. The cabinet is responsible for the preparation and professional analysis of proposals and renewals. They support new and existing customers in the integration of benefits management functions. The work provides support and accuracy to companies with employee enrolment and changes, employer/employee contribution, invoicing as well as claims management. Other functions such as maintenance and the reactivation of benefits in the event of long term disability, temporary lay off or leave of absence are integrated into the C-surance.ca system. This allows for a centralization of all functions as well as the ability to add the companies collective agreements and insurance contracts directly into the system for quick reference. Our new expertise, supported by C-surance.ca technologies, enables us to offer clients and prospects major savings, a simplification of the processes, better access to their information and a reduction of errors. Our offering now extends to mining and forest companies which use to deal exclusively with large Montreal and Toronto consulting firms. This constitutes a distinctive element. We can now offer high level services while maintaining a local and personalized presence. By respecting our traditional market of small to medium size companies, we now offer services to large corporation in a way that even the best national firms cannot offer  boasts M. Lavergne The quality of support provided by MDI to Groupe financier Abi-Témi Inc is a determining factor in our success. From the beginning of this transformation, MDIs team of professionals has provided us with excellent support in the integration of this technology. MDI has also enabled us to familiarize ourselves with several new modules and learn to appreciate the added value before we need to commit additional funds. For that, we are very grateful concludes in concert the team members at Group financier Abi-Témi inc.. The future looks bright for this Abitibi-Témiscamingue firm. You dont need to be in Montreal or Toronto to offer services of this calibre. Group financier Abi-Témi inc., along with C-surance.ca, is reducing costs and providing innovative solutions and services to their clients.

Service financier JDF Inc.<br>
&quot;Committing to the C-surance.ca service in 2004 was one great<br>
business decision. Thanks to the availability of MDI tools and<br>
services, we were able to substantially improve our efficiency<br>
as well as the quality of our offer while making substantial<br>
financial gains.<br>
The flexibility and the power of the technology combined with<br>
the quality of the available analysis enabled us to offer our<br>
customers distinctive value added products instead of<br>
promoting pricing only. Our customer always wins since we are<br>
able to custom fit to their very needs while providing them with<br>
competitive pricing. <br>
Jean Denis Roy, President and CEO<br>
Financial Services JDF Inc. is a leading group insurance<br>
professional advisor addressing the needs of Québec<br>
enterprises. Dynamics and forward thinking the company<br>
prides itself for providing high level Client Centric<br>
Services. Mr. Roy did not wish to build his company on<br>
offering the lowest prices, but on proposing the best<br>
price/ratio products and services that will fit the client<br>
needs.<br>
With an annual growth of more than 38%, it was obvious<br>
that selecting the right technology would be as paramount<br>
as the reputation of the provider. C-surance.ca as well<br>
as more than 26 years of dedicated services to the<br>
insurance industry made MDI the ideal choice.<br>
One of C-surance.ca characteristics is the flexibility given<br>
to the client to pick and choose the needed tools. In this<br>
case, the customer first adhered to the basic service then<br>
gradually added complementary services which responded<br>
to their specific needs. By the same token, it is possible to<br>
drop services if and when they become irrelevant.<br>
The bottom line after 2 years of use is very positive: Csurance.<br>
ca technology made it possible to reduce from<br>
three (3) to only one (1) the number of resources assigned<br>
to the preparation of RFP, analysis and specifications.<br>
The two (2) resources were reassigned to more<br>
productive and profitable marketing activities.<br>
The conversion of the existing files was carried out<br>
gradually with minimum efforts thanks to powerful Excel import/export options. The C-surance.ca<br>
technology made it possible to standardize the formats and the contents of information, but more<br>
importantly it made it possible to regroup ALL the available information within one single data<br>
base, whereby completely eliminating multiple input of the same information. As soon as the<br>
information is inputted in C-surance.ca it becomes possible to respond instantaneously and in<br>
real time to any requests coming from either the customers or the carriers.<br>
<br>
The pay as you go rating structure of C-surance.ca is very business friendly and ensures an<br>
almost instant ROI Return on Investment. Entry fees for the various services are a fraction of<br>
the traditional costs of buying a licence. Usage fees are based on the volume as well as the<br>
number of authorized accesses. Hereby, whatever the business volume, the client will pay only a<br>
fraction of the gained benefit associated with the usage of the service. Moreover, the privilege to<br>
end at any time without penalty with a short 90 days notice brings an additional guarantee of a<br>
quality of service and high level performance since MDI must, every day, earn the business.<br>
Quantitatively, the current standard at JDF for the creation of a new RFP file (average 50-100<br>
employees), electronically transmitting them to the carriers (3-8) and preparing for the client all<br>
the comprehensive comparative analysis including each of the received offers from the carriers is<br>
done in less than 3 hours. The objective is to drop this to less than 2 hours within the next the 6<br>
month. Needless to say that with the minimal invested effort it is then possible to convert the<br>
prospect into a client with the click of a mouse. Keeping information up to date or generating<br>
invoices or employer/employee contribution will be then become child play. C-surance.ca provide<br>
in real time for any or all the employees the needed combined or individual detailed reports that<br>
will reflect changes or simply what if scenarios. Calculations of the employer/employee<br>
contributions are optimized fiscally and available automatically with a few key strokes or mouse<br>
clicks.<br>
C-surance.ca has proven to be a very reliable, efficient and economically sounded partner. We<br>
have access to an A to Z tools kit that provides ALL the tools necessary to answer each of our<br>
customers request. We are always sure that whenever the need will occur, we will have access<br>
to a product or a service which will exceed our expectation and this at a cost that will be fair and<br>
competitive.<br>
MDI customer service is definitively a strong point. The experts understand our needs and those<br>
of our customers. They respond quickly and effectively our requests.<br>
With C-surance.ca the industry revolves around OUR operations. It is we who control. <br>

              IBM confirms 15 years of technological advancement for CSUSGI and $4 billion in potential saving <br>
  <br>
Laval on January 13 2007, C-surance.ca Global Service Inc/MDI (CSUGSI) is proud to take note that IBM analysts describe the «C-surance.ca Suite» as the ideal business model with which the insurance industry could renew themselves.  The model insures reduced operating costs that benefit the consumers. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
More than $7.5B   is spent annually to cover the cost of managing group benefits insurance. The C-surance.ca suite of service is the first UNIVERSAL CLIENT CENTRIC COLLABORATIVE WEB solution that guarantees group benefits insurance saving.    The simplified management processes perfectly reflects the new business model proposed by IBM. CSUGSI professionals estimate that $4B annually could be saved   once the solution   is implemented globally.   This  represent some 250$ per  person. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The IBM Institute for Business Value Study titled « Insurance 2020: Innovating beyond old models », dated May 23rd 2006, is a significant endorsement of our 10 years of R&amp;D and millions in investments said Mr. Richard Sirois, President and CEO, CSUGSI. With the evolution of the WEB technologies, MDI undertook in 2000 a total revision of the group benefits management processes and adapted these changes to its original Allegroupe software,   which had been on the market since 1995.  We put aside all the traditional paradigms of operations and reinvented each process to capitalize on the potential of emergent technologies. The report presented by the IBM professionals precisely reflects the objectives and the challenges on which our professionals invested themselves for years. CSUGSI could hardly have better described its C-surance.ca project added Mr. Sirois. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The technological and financial risks necessary to carry out its C-surance.ca project were important. But the results are impressive. The IBM report which presents the insurance model for 2020, attributes C-surance.ca 15 years of technology leadership.  Case studies show that the business works extremely well financially as an CSUGSI customer succeeded in saving annually more than $500   per employee. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
All the participants including insurers, professional benefits advisors/actuaries, sponsors/employers/trade unions/governments, health care providers and professionals   profit from this new opportunity. The largest gains go to the sponsor and therefore the consumers. We expect the sponsor to become the principal promoter of the new technology available.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
C-surance.ca proposes the service in SAAS (Software As A Service) mode simplifying the processes of implementation/integration and ensuring of new levels of effectiveness, saving as well as improving management of group insurance. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
To fully appreciate the importance of CSUGSI innovation, one can compare the C-surance.ca solution for the management of the group benefits with the revolution that the ATM brought to the banking operations. <br>

              Case Study: <br>
Syndicat des débardeurs du Port de Montréal <br>
<br>
&quot;Since 2002, we have successfully reduced our annual management fees and claims by an average of over 500$ per active employee while improving our control over information, optimizing our processes and reducing payment for unjustified claims! These savings provided us with the means to maintain intact our existing benefits, while extending new health benefits that better reflect todays needs, such as disability coverage. » Benoit Wolfe, Administrative Director of Régime de Sécurité Sociale du Syndicat des Débardeurs, SCFP section locale 375 Established for more than one hundred years, the Port of Montreal Dockers union is one of the oldest unions in the Province of Quebec. With one thousand active members and about 650 pensioners under administration and working for 5 maritime employers, the Port of Montreal Dockers union is certainly a model of a successful self administered plan managed by a union organization. In 1972, under Mr. Théodore Beaudin then president, the union began to gradually step into a self-administration plan: a trust was created to offer a uniform drugs and healthcare coverage to all active members. Later in 1990, the union negotiated and obtained from their employers a better group plan for the benefit of its members; life insurance, dental care, short and long term disability benefits were added to those already offered by the union. Beginning with a standard administrative formula assumed by carriers, in an ASO mode towards 1999, the union quickly realized that successive premium increases put seriously in danger the survival of the plan for its members. Many reasons could explain the problem: The lack of controls from carriers to claim payment, unjustified paid claims and high administrative charges, etc... In 2001, the union decided then to take care of the full administration and adjudication of its group plan, with the exception of the life insurance benefit. To do it, the union purchased C -surance.ca/Allegroupe service, a fully integrated group plan administrative system from MDI Since then, with more than 100,000 paid claims per year to members and dependents, the union manages and controls from A to Z its group plan.<br>
<br>
Amongst our most concrete benefits following the in house implementation of the MDI solution is the fact that the union is saving annually over 500,000$ since 2001. Saving is mainly credited to the following activities: - Elimination of dental and drug cards : o Expense associated with these cards varied from 4 to 40% of paid contribution. &amp;#56256;&amp;#56451; The cost of managing the partial reimbursement for retired employees of the RAMQ deductible through the drug card where costing approximately 40% of actual payout. Saving allowed an increase in the deductible reimbursement % for these members without actually adding to the available budget. &amp;#56256;&amp;#56451; Eliminating the standard 12% fee for dental and 4% for drug cards used by our active members provided additional funds to help us improve the available services. o Changing the payment model and inviting the members to pay for services before submitting claims, generated a positive modification in the purchase habit. The impact was major as it allowed for a reduction of consumption of services that where not essential. - Internal management provided with opportunities to identify weaknesses in regard with the previously available tools as well as allowed to better set up the contract configuration. These sensitive control might not have been a priority with our previous provider as they where operating under a cost plus formula. As an example: clauses that should have limited payment of denture to once every 3 or 5 years, went more often than not unnoticed by our carrier. - By having a direct access to each claim, the administrators were able to identify trends. Some of those allowed for stopping of abuses as well as potential fraudulent claims. Over and above the financial improvement for the members, the in house access and tools provided a way to improve substantially the speed of services to members. When needed, a check can be issued within a few minutes. This efficiency did not go unnoticed by none union employees that are managing the service, as their personal experience with traditional carrier can no way compare with the quality and speed the members are getting day in and day out. We can react and decide faster than before. C-surance.ca provides us with all the tools, information, reports and flexibility needed for a quick decision making. We&#39;re now in full control!!! .

Groupe Financier Abi-Témi Inc. <br>
&quot;Backed by an exceptional team and the best available technology in Canada, we are proud to offer innovative, cost effective, and strong value added services to our present and future clients! The ageing of the population as well as economic pressures on local companies led us to re-evaluate traditional group insurance services. We left no stone unturned in search of the most efficient business processes and tools that would give more to our clients while protecting their insurance investments. After we completed our C-surance.ca technological investments training program, we were sold. C-surance.ca was exactly what we were looking for to aid our team in offering world class services to our clients. Our clients are the winners!&quot; Mr Étienne Lambert, President<br>
<br>
Established in 1981, Groupe financier Abi-témi Inc., a life insurance and financial services firm in Rouyn Noranda, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, distinguish their company by offering higher level services and unsurpassed professionalism in the area of benefits management. In previous months, Étienne Lambert, president, and Benoit Côté, founder, literally reinvented the cabinet to capitalize on this new trend to offer companies and trade unions outstanding services that will simplify management efforts, improve access to information and reduce direct and indirect management costs. Thanks to C-surance.ca technology, Groupe financier Abi-Témi inc. now addresses the group insurance and employee benefits market with renewed confidence. With a range of innovative tools at their disposal, they are now able to look for new market opportunities. Thanks to these new technologies, the company is now able to concentrate its energy on providing unequalled service says Mr. Benoît Côté. The group benefits management processes are now standardized under a single system which automates administrative tasks while ensuring almost absolute reliability continues Mr. Côté. Mr. Côté had several opportunities to work with these new technologies thanks to Richard Sirois, president and founder of MDI. With the arrival of Mr. Lambert in June 2006, Groupe financier Abi-Témi decided to go forward with this innovative project. The implementation of this new group insurance technology is a great boost to the evolution of our profession comments Mr. Lambert. All of which benefits every segment of this industry.<br>
<br>
Thanks to these technologies, benefits managers have access to straight forward and user friendly solutions which is easy to navigate within what is normally a very complicated environment. Groupe financier Abi-Témi inc. now offers integrated management of all benefits management related activities through a single input of information, therefore reducing direct and indirect costs to clients. The legal framework for managing group insurance benefits include insurance laws, income tax laws, Civil Code, Workmans compensation, unemployment insurance, provincial and federal healthcare policies and pensions as well as other various provincial labour laws. The complexity of laws and the high risk of errors and omissions with which companies and organizations are faced with force them to seek increasingly more sophisticated services. This is the context in which C-surance.ca performs best. Groupe financier Abi-Témi Inc. called up the services of a third group benefits and pension advisor. Few brokers in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, especially in Rouyn-Noranda, can pride themselves in having three licensed group insurance representatives under their belt. The cabinet is responsible for the preparation and professional analysis of proposals and renewals. They support new and existing customers in the integration of benefits management functions. The work provides support and accuracy to companies with employee enrolment and changes, employer/employee contribution, invoicing as well as claims management. Other functions such as maintenance and the reactivation of benefits in the event of long term disability, temporary lay off or leave of absence are integrated into the C-surance.ca system. This allows for a centralization of all functions as well as the ability to add the companies collective agreements and insurance contracts directly into the system for quick reference. Our new expertise, supported by C-surance.ca technologies, enables us to offer clients and prospects major savings, a simplification of the processes, better access to their information and a reduction of errors. Our offering now extends to mining and forest companies which use to deal exclusively with large Montreal and Toronto consulting firms. This constitutes a distinctive element. We can now offer high level services while maintaining a local and personalized presence. By respecting our traditional market of small to medium size companies, we now offer services to large corporation in a way that even the best national firms cannot offer  boasts M. Lavergne The quality of support provided by MDI to Groupe financier Abi-Témi Inc is a determining factor in our success. From the beginning of this transformation, MDIs team of professionals has provided us with excellent support in the integration of this technology. MDI has also enabled us to familiarize ourselves with several new modules and learn to appreciate the added value before we need to commit additional funds. For that, we are very grateful concludes in concert the team members at Group financier Abi-Témi inc.. The future looks bright for this Abitibi-Témiscamingue firm. You dont need to be in Montreal or Toronto to offer services of this calibre. Group financier Abi-Témi inc., along with C-surance.ca, is reducing costs and providing innovative solutions and services to their clients.
