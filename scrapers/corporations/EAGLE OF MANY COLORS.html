        <br>            Child intervention Practice framework supports the safety, well-being and permanency for young children and youth. The Signs of Safety approach used compliments the Tipi Teachings. It is strength based, safety organized, solution- focused, therapeutic, collaborative, assess&#39;s, and creates an evolving safety plan. It is a tool created from the teachings and adapted to fit any person in any situation. <br>The past trends in Child Intervention have not adequately met the needs of Indigenous children and families. This knowledge provides the motivation to turn to our Indigenous Elders to seek guidance, support and expertise that has always been present within Indigenous communities. Once we are willing to listen and learn, we place ourselves in a position to become allies to work together in true partnership towards the healing of Indigenous children, families and communities. Practice that has at its foundation the honoring of relationships will benefit all children, families, and staff, Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike. The overrepresentation of Indigenous children in care and the number of Indigenous children placed in foster, kinship and permanent placements that are not culturally appropriate is the focus of the business.<br>Working towards a more complete understanding of the root cause of this overrepresentation and identifying present practices that contribute to this problem will provide the opportunity to see improved outcomes for Indigenous children and families served by Child Intervention Services.<br>Eagle of Many Colors is a new business. It is located in Beaver Lake, Alberta. It is owned and operated by Dana Nepoose. Dana has over 10 years experience working in Child Intervention and counseling. There is support for addressing this overrepresentation. Despite the important shifts in practice, values and guiding principles that Child Intervention has undertaken such as implementing Collaborative Service Delivery, the Signs of Safety Approach and embedding the Practice Framework throughout, there remains an overrepresentation of Indigenous children in care. It is important throughout the discussion of Indigenous identity and social cohesion to acknowledge the diversity of Indigenous Nations. It is seen as critical to avoid a “pan-Indigenous” approach in supporting Indigenous clients as that would not honour the unique histories of Indigenous, Métis and Inuit peoples represented. Consequently, it is vital to acknowledge that the expression of Indigenous identity and social cohesion should reflect the protocols of the Indigenous community with which the client identifies – and not have other cultural processes imposed by the program or funder. As a result of the variation between Indigenous peoples, it may be difficult for any one agency to fully support the range of clients that would form their client base. As a result of this challenge, it was felt that the focus of the business and outcomes work should be on foundational teachings that appear to be fairly common across a number of Indigenous worldviews - while still acknowledging and respecting that there may be variation in the application of these teachings. These teachings represent the essence of the seven teachings, the Natural Laws, Circle Process, Tipi Teachings, and various levels and types of ceremony; as long as these concepts are provided only as foundational concepts, transferability between various Indigenous groups should be relatively problem-free. These teachings include love, honesty, courage, respect, wisdom, humility, and truth with the Natural Laws including Love, Honesty, Sharing and Determination. If agency programming relies on embracing these teachings and their core values, the issue of Indigenous diversity can be supported and respected across programs and services.<br>

                            The task of Eagle of Many Colors is to propose a way forward utilizing the teachings. It is acknowledged that moving forward will be done by bringing everyone involved into culture, into this model, through creating and nurturing relationships. In these relationships we will seek trust, reciprocity, and understanding - knowing without balanced relationships our work will continue to be oppressive. <br>
How: Training to be provided to all levels that is delivered experientially through Tipi Teachings and includes the following: “cultural competency” In most cases non-Aboriginal service providers offer services to Aboriginal peoples. One institutional response has been to create “cultural awareness” training, often referred to as “Cultural Competency Training”. In some cases, this has resulted in the requirement that service providers complete an eight-hour workshop, once a year, in order to achieve cultural awareness in their provision of services. It is concerning that service providers believe that this minimal training will result in cultural competency when non-Aboriginal workers are providing services to Aboriginal clients. Becoming an Aboriginal ally requires a deeper understanding of an Aboriginal worldview, values, beliefs, and teachings. The practice of &quot;omanitew&quot; – to celebrate your visitors, to make space for them physically and spiritually is a core teaching and way of life in the Aboriginal community, to make sure our visitors have the best, both while they are with us and when they leave. Our role is to honor their presence, provide emotional, physical, spiritual and mental support and to ensure that, when they leave our place, they leave with everything we can provide to enable them to continue their journey. It is my belief that the practice of omanitew is only possible within the context of ceremony, and that our provision of services – our practice– is ceremony. I suggest that, in accordance with the teachings and practices, this is a more relevant concept than “cultural competency.” That is, to practice omanitew with our clients. To celebrate when they enter into our programs, to make ceremonial space for them within our programs, and to provide them with the best we can for them to continue their journey once they leave. Many social workers have received a very western-based education. This is not, in itself, a bad thing. It does become problematic however when significant numbers of clients served have Aboriginal ancestry. Social workers working with Aboriginal clients could have an advanced knowledge of Aboriginal worldviews, beliefs, and values (Beecher, Reeves, Eggertsen &amp; Furuto, 2010). It has been my experience that this learning can occur, and that both Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people benefit, in surprising and unexpected ways, when they have this learning. I believe that a more intentional process of educating human social workers would be of benefit to everyone, especially to the Aboriginal children and families receiving services from child intervention services. <br>

                            The task of Eagle of Many Colors is to propose a way forward utilizing the teachings. It is acknowledged that moving forward will be done by bringing everyone involved into culture, into this model, through creating and nurturing relationships. In these relationships we will seek trust, reciprocity, and understanding - knowing without balanced relationships our work will continue to be oppressive. <br>
How: Training to be provided to all levels that is delivered experientially through Tipi Teachings and includes the following: “cultural competency” In most cases non-Aboriginal service providers offer services to Aboriginal peoples. One institutional response has been to create “cultural awareness” training, often referred to as “Cultural Competency Training”. In some cases, this has resulted in the requirement that service providers complete an eight-hour workshop, once a year, in order to achieve cultural awareness in their provision of services. It is concerning that service providers believe that this minimal training will result in cultural competency when non-Aboriginal workers are providing services to Aboriginal clients. Becoming an Aboriginal ally requires a deeper understanding of an Aboriginal worldview, values, beliefs, and teachings. The practice of &quot;omanitew&quot; – to celebrate your visitors, to make space for them physically and spiritually is a core teaching and way of life in the Aboriginal community, to make sure our visitors have the best, both while they are with us and when they leave. Our role is to honor their presence, provide emotional, physical, spiritual and mental support and to ensure that, when they leave our place, they leave with everything we can provide to enable them to continue their journey. It is my belief that the practice of omanitew is only possible within the context of ceremony, and that our provision of services – our practice– is ceremony. I suggest that, in accordance with the teachings and practices, this is a more relevant concept than “cultural competency.” That is, to practice omanitew with our clients. To celebrate when they enter into our programs, to make ceremonial space for them within our programs, and to provide them with the best we can for them to continue their journey once they leave. Many social workers have received a very western-based education. This is not, in itself, a bad thing. It does become problematic however when significant numbers of clients served have Aboriginal ancestry. Social workers working with Aboriginal clients could have an advanced knowledge of Aboriginal worldviews, beliefs, and values (Beecher, Reeves, Eggertsen &amp; Furuto, 2010). It has been my experience that this learning can occur, and that both Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people benefit, in surprising and unexpected ways, when they have this learning. I believe that a more intentional process of educating human social workers would be of benefit to everyone, especially to the Aboriginal children and families receiving services from child intervention services. <br>
