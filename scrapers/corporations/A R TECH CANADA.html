            FUTURE CHANGE  THE SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGE<br>
<br>
<br>
In order to advance the technological requirements of the <br>
anticipated future trends on universal energy demands, the need <br>
for focused research and identification of practical solutions <br>
must drive the process. A R TECH identified some major factors <br>
that lead to the development of a unique substation concept and <br>
design that will revolutionize today and tomorrows distribution <br>
practices. Our research and development towards addressing those <br>
needs originated in 1994.  Several conclusions were extracted <br>
from the many sources available. Our response to the looming <br>
crises is summarized as follows:<br>
<br>
·	An increase in the developing worlds population will <br>
translate into sustainability problems, based on elevated <br>
electrical loads in both residential and industrial <br>
applications. This translates into ongoing demand, increased <br>
shortages and the inability of many countries to respond <br>
adequately.<br>
<br>
·	The demand for electrical distribution and <br>
infrastructure expansion is expected to grow at increasingly <br>
accelerated rates. A way must be found to reduce capital costs <br>
to allow for a lower cost per unit value, to maximize the <br>
potential to meet that demand.<br>
<br>
·	The need for the development of more compact <br>
substations, amongst other desired technological advances, must <br>
alter the existing strategies for established engineering, <br>
implementation and distribution concepts and practices. (There <br>
must be a better way / better ways?)<br>
<br>
·	A preference for pre-connected cables, pre-manufactured, <br>
integrated assemblies and state of the art approaches must be a <br>
major contributing factor to problem solving, cost reduction, <br>
technological advantage and change.<br>
<br>
·	An expanded use of SF6 (sulfur hexaflouride ) gas <br>
insulation has been identified as environmentally safe, a major <br>
advantage in design, and desirable, offering reduced maintenance <br>
costs and superior life cycle performance of load break <br>
switching.<br>
<br>
·	Oil filled / padmount transformers are a proven design. <br>
Traditionally, there were some environmental factors (PCBs or <br>
other leakage implications) that could have limited their <br>
selection or appeal. In order to maximize their appeal, the <br>
ability to install them in non-fire rated environments would <br>
benefit a significant sector of any economy. R-Temp oil (LNAN), <br>
a substitute for the standard transformer oil fill, satisfies <br>
that need, since it is non-toxic, inflammable and <br>
environmentally safe, as an alternative.<br>
<br>
·	The distribution grid in many countries is already <br>
incapable of satisfying existing demands, or the existing <br>
infrastructure, from a future perspective, will need to be <br>
rebuilt with environmentally friendly and cost saving <br>
strategies, as a minimum.<br>
<br>
·	Ongoing research from international think tanks, <br>
statistical data, trade analysis, import / export opportunities <br>
and economic outlooks require constant scrutiny by consulting <br>
varied reports or publications. The political consequences of <br>
energy shortages, privatization attempts, monopolistic <br>
resistance to change or other territorial specifics, are <br>
significant factors to monitor. This analysis, which must be <br>
available on a timely basis, is key to predicting probable <br>
results or opportunities within various political and geographic <br>
trading blocks. <br>
<br>
·	Political models, institutions, trade negotiations, <br>
workable agreements and market accessibility to foreign market <br>
sectors will be determining factors in the global energy <br>
challenge towards demand growth, stable economies and markets, <br>
environmental impact and strategic planning.<br>
<br>
<br>
The above statements are credited to US, Canadian and <br>
international sources that are publicly available in varied <br>
forms of media.<br>
<br>
<br>
A SOLUTION<br>
<br>
<br>
A R TECH created our unique MiniSub to address our own domestic <br>
marketplace, while recognizing the fact that our strategic <br>
exporting component has satisfied the very need thats already <br>
been highlighted.  <br>
<br>
The MiniSub substation is manufactured under our other Canadian <br>
corporation, POWER SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY (LTD). Consult the <br>
following section to see the engineering highlights and options <br>
that make this state of the art, high technology unit, the <br>
revolutionary distribution alternative.<br>
<br>
The MINISUB:<br>
<br>
Power Systems Technology has developed a new concept in unit <br>
substation design which brings together the unique benefits of <br>
oil / liquid filled padmount transformers as defined by the CSA <br>
specification C227.4, and SF6 switching technology using the Arc-<br>
Whipper© three position switch. <br>
<br>
With all these advantages: <br>
<br>
·	Compact size is only slightly larger than a padmount <br>
transformer. This unit can house up to 3 load break primary <br>
disconnects, fusing, secondary metering and distribution. <br>
<br>
·	Primary load break switches offer gas filled technology <br>
to provide maintenance-free service for the life of the unit. <br>
<br>
·	Interconnecting components of the switching to the <br>
transformer allow the switches to be unplugged from the <br>
transformer in minutes. <br>
<br>
·	All the primary compartments are submersible. There are <br>
no live parts, including the cable connections! <br>
<br>
·	Provision for grounding of any switch.<br>
<br>
·	Available in an automatic transfer from 2 primary feeds.<br>
 <br>
·	Available with Industry Canada approved metering. <br>
<br>
·	Secondary can accommodate a wide range of breaker <br>
arrangements. <br>
<br>
·	Designed to meet the requirements of non-utility <br>
operated equipment. <br>
<br>
·	Completely tamperproof and weatherproof. <br>
 <br>
Switchgear Inside the MiniSub:<br>
<br>
Visible Break Conforms to widely accepted operating safety <br>
practice, giving clear visual confirmation of contact position <br>
of ALL THREE PHASES through the viewing windows in the tank. The <br>
large open gap allows field voltage testing without cable <br>
removal. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Manual, Remote or Automatic Switching:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper©, is equipped for manual operation as standard and <br>
includes: External handles for operation by hand; quick <br>
make/break spring operators; bushing oriented line diagram; <br>
positive position indicators; padlock provisions; and operating <br>
instructions. Remote operation can also be optionally provided. <br>
Motor operators with pushbutton(s) or SCADA  (Supervisory <br>
Control and Data Acquisition) control are possible approaches. <br>
Automatic transfer switches use fast acting motor operators with <br>
voltage / current sensing and full function control. Units are <br>
factory wired and adjusted.<br>
<br>
Construction Features:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper©, SF6 load-break switches are ruggedly constructed, <br>
incorporate proven design and are rated/tested in accordance <br>
with ANSI standards C37.71-1984 and C37.72-1987 for long life <br>
with minimal maintenance. Switch contacts are equipped with very <br>
high speed auxiliary arcing contacts to quickly interrupt in ¼ <br>
to ½ cycle, leaving main contact surfaces undamaged by arcing. <br>
The arcing contact allows main contacts to be designed for high <br>
continuous, fault close and momentary current performance. <br>
Switches are factory filled with non-toxic, non-flammable, high <br>
dielectric SF6 gas insulation. SF6 quality and stability are <br>
maintained by use of totally sealed tank construction, an <br>
internal purifying absorbent and the extremely fast Arc-<br>
Whipper©  interrupter. A color coded, field replaceable pressure <br>
gauge and self-sealing fill valve allow monitoring and addition <br>
of SF6 as necessary. <br>
<br>
Switch tanks are ¼ thick steel with a highly corrosion / <br>
abrasion resistant 5 mil epoxy finish. External fittings and <br>
fasteners are marine grade stainless steel or bronze. For <br>
increased corrosion resistance, stainless steel tanks can be <br>
provided. Current carrying parts are high conductivity <br>
electrolytic grade copper with plating, locking fasteners, and <br>
torque wrench assembly to assure permanent low resistance <br>
connections. Moving contacts are self-aligning, self cleaning <br>
(wiping type) and designed to increase contact pressure with <br>
increasing currents. Contact assemblies are supported by high <br>
strength, molded glass polyester insulation with flex connectors <br>
at critical locations to prevent stressing and misaligning due <br>
to high current or mechanical forces. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ratings:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper© SF6 load-break switches are designed, tested and <br>
rated per applicable sections of IEEE, ANSI, NEMA, CSA and other <br>
industry standards including: <br>
·	ANSI C37.71-1984 Standard for Subsurface Load <br>
Interrupting Switches. <br>
·	ANSI C37.72-1987 Standard for Padmounted Load <br>
Interrupting Switches. <br>
·	ANSI/IEEE 386 Standard for Separable Connectors and <br>
Bushings. <br>
·	IEC 265 International Standards for Load Interrupting <br>
Switches. <br>
·	ASTM D-2472 Specification for Commercial Type Electrical <br>
Grade SF6. <br>
·	ANSI C57.12.28 Standard for Padmount Enclosures. <br>
Note: 35 kV information available on request <br>
<br>
<br>
Application Information:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper© SF6 load-break switches are completely submersible, <br>
fully dead-front, and corrosion resistant for application in the <br>
harshest conditions including areas subject to flooding, severe <br>
contamination, rodents and snakes, blowing snow/dust, sea <br>
coasts, high altitude, and even Division 2 hazardous locations. <br>
Non-toxic, non-flammable SF6 insulation permits installation <br>
indoors or outdoors in high traffic areas. Compact size and <br>
reduced weight provide solutions where overall space is <br>
important such as in high-rise buildings, front lot lines and in <br>
small vaults. <br>
<br>
Switch Operators and Options:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper©  SF6 load break switches are equipped with external <br>
handles for manual operation as standard. The handle can be <br>
padlocked in all switch positions and has an anti-reversing <br>
feature for additional safety. Interlocks can be provided <br>
as may be required by local practice and for increased safety. <br>
In addition, remote/SCADA and fully automatic operators are <br>
available for increased levels of control and system automation. <br>
These motor operators attach to the switch handle and may be <br>
easily disconnected for manual operation. <br>
<br>
Manual Operation:<br>
<br>
The handles are removable and can be attached to the switch-<br>
operating shaft through an arc of 360 degrees, in 45degree <br>
increments, for maximum mechanical advantage during operation or <br>
may be removed and stored on the pad-lockable hanger bracket <br>
when not in use. Rotating the handle toward the desired position <br>
causes quick make / break, spring operated contact movement <br>
independent of the operating handle movement. Latches prevent <br>
contact blow off and provide positive position indication. <br>
Additional features include: padlock provisions in all <br>
positions, bushing oriented line diagram and instructions. Three <br>
position switches are equipped with anti-pass through provisions <br>
to prevent inadvertent operation to the third position. <br>
<br>
Key Interlocks:<br>
<br>
Are available as required to prevent paralleling feeders or to <br>
limit access to energized equipment or to otherwise coordinate <br>
proper system operation. Key-locks are mounted on the specified <br>
switched ways with locking provided for the required position. <br>
<br>
Automatic Load Transfer Switches:<br>
<br>
The MiniSub is ideal for maintaining power to critical loads <br>
such as hospitals, airports, shopping centers, and industrial <br>
facilities. Upon loss of preferred primary feeder voltage, the <br>
load is automatically transferred to an alternate source. <br>
Optional automatic retransfer, over current detection and fault <br>
isolation provide additional system flexibility. Units include <br>
fast acting 120 VAC motor operators attached to the switch <br>
operating handles. Voltage sensing is done through a set of <br>
elbow mounted detectors and relay combination which supply data <br>
to the full function automatic control with self-contained 120 <br>
VAC/24VDC control power source. All items are factory assembled, <br>
wired, adjusted, and tested for simplified installation and <br>
operation. <br>
<br>
Visible Break, Make and Ground:<br>
<br>
Each switched way is equipped with a viewing window for clear, <br>
visual confirmation and assurance of contact position of ALL <br>
PHASES. Conforms to local code and operation practices, which <br>
require visible break and (where equipped) visible grounding <br>
during system operation, maintenance, repair, or testing. <br>
<br>
Anti-reverse Operating Handles:<br>
<br>
Eliminate the possibility of interrupting currents beyond the <br>
capability of the switch by preventing immediate operation after <br>
closing on a fault. A latch on the operating handle must be <br>
reset prior to subsequent operation allowing upstream circuit <br>
protection time to clear the fault. <br>
<br>
Primary Cable Terminations: <br>
<br>
ANSI/IEEE standard 386 defines the specific interfaces <br>
dimensions that 200 and 600 amp, elbows, inserts and equipment <br>
bushings must conform to insure interchangeability. The 200 amp <br>
load break, and 600 amp non load break connectors provide a <br>
convenient and safe way to connect all primary cables. With the <br>
use of a Raychem PILC kit, lead cables can be <br>
connected using the same style. While the cables and <br>
terminations are barriered from access, the elbow test point <br>
offers an additional security and safety, as well as a voltage <br>
reference for automatic or SCADA type operations This <br>
termination provides a dead front waterproof connection. <br>
<br>
<br>
THE TRANSFORMER:<br>
<br>
Power Systems Technology has chosen to use the basic padmount <br>
transformer design, which is a proven technology since the <br>
1970s. This transformer design offers an economic and reliable <br>
package and making the overall appearance very acceptable. <br>
<br>
All transformers used with the Power Systems MiniSubä are built <br>
to the CSA C227.4 M1978 specification, and conforms to CSA C802 <br>
specification for efficiency and losses. Transformer sizes are <br>
available from 150 KVA up to 3000 KVA in 5 to 34.5 kV range. <br>
This gives a very broad range of application for the MiniSubä. <br>
<br>
Transformers are available in standard transformer oil (ONAN), <br>
or R-temp oil (LNAN) for installation in non-fire rated <br>
environments. Our transformer designs are also built to meet <br>
ANSI/IEEE C57.92-1981 guide for loading of oil filled <br>
transformers 55°C or 65°C rise, which allows for up to 30% <br>
overload. <br>
<br>
Transformer Standard Accessories:<br>
·	Fuse Protection <br>
·	Liquid temperature gauge <br>
·	Liquid level gauge <br>
·	Pressure relief device <br>
·	Fill and drain valve <br>
·	Transformer riveted cover <br>
·	Tap switch and off load 5 position changer <br>
·	Copper ground bar in both HV and LV compartments <br>
·	Lifting and jacking devices <br>
·	Spare fuse holder <br>
·	Tamperproof design with secure hinges and lockable <br>
handle. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bay-O-Net Fusing:<br>
<br>
All Power Systems MiniSubs are equipped with a system of Bay-O-<br>
Net and current limiting fuse assemblies in a two fuse <br>
protection scheme, with the current limiting fuse as the backup. <br>
In this arrangement, secondary faults and overload currents are <br>
cleared by the Bay-O-Net fuse. High level faults caused by <br>
internal failure is cleared by the CL fuse. The two fuses are <br>
connected in series. If a CL fuse is not required, an isolation <br>
link is provided. <br>
<br>
Access to the Bay-O-Net use is restricted by a metal cover over <br>
the fuse holders which is key interlocked with the Arc-Whipper© <br>
switch, to be sure that power is in the off position prior to <br>
assessing the fuses. <br>
<br>
<br>
Note: The application of internal fusing in voltages at 25kV and <br>
above can only be done in a wye primary connected design. The <br>
load on the transformer cannot exceed more than 50% delta <br>
connected secondary loads. Certain condition of ferrule <br>
resonance can exist at these voltages and the application of <br>
lightning arrestors should be considered. <br>
<br>
<br>
THE CONNECTION:<br>
<br>
This unique connection between the SF6 switch and the <br>
transformer allows the switch(es) to be plugged in for a <br>
watertight connection. This feature allows the switch to be <br>
removed in the field for service, if required. A transformer can <br>
be replaced with this method in a few hours. This connection <br>
maintains the submersible criteria of the MiniSub unit.<br>
<br>
Low Voltage Compartment: <br>
<br>
There are a wide variety of accessories available in the <br>
secondary compartment. This is specific to each project and <br>
designers needs. This can include: <br>
<br>
·	Digital metering for customers or utilities. <br>
·	Separate metering access door <br>
·	Main Breakers <br>
·	Ground fault protection <br>
·	Feeder Breakers <br>

MINISUB   SUMMARY OF COST BENEFITS:<br>
<br>
<br>
It becomes inevitable that we examine the cost factors, in terms <br>
of real and potential savings, based on capital cost <br>
expenditures and long term maintenance factors. If we look at <br>
the conventional methods of providing the service entrance and <br>
distribution requirements / components, then it will be assumed <br>
that the methodology, pricing factors, typical or special <br>
considerations and space requirements are well known. <br>
<br>
If we now look at the new concept proposed in this section, then <br>
the basic premise of where areas of savings can be identified, <br>
can be elaborated on, as shown in the following list:<br>
<br>
·	The LOOP switching design offers a distributed model <br>
where you eliminate the main electrical vault(s) and the <br>
extensive cable routing that results from a central distribution <br>
model.<br>
<br>
·	Reduced sources of electrical noise, specifically, EMI <br>
(electro-magnetic interference) &amp; RFI (radio frequency <br>
interference) and the costs associated with reducing or <br>
eliminating these problems (where applicable).<br>
<br>
·	A SINGLE main incoming electrical feeder is the only <br>
(primary) cabling required to a building structure or site <br>
complex.<br>
<br>
·	MiniSubs LOOP together, meaning that the primary feed <br>
can be daisy chained from one unit to the next. Through a <br>
special switching design, each / any / all of the MiniSubs can <br>
operate independently of each other, regardless of the status of <br>
any single / local MiniSub in the network.<br>
<br>
·	The MiniSub could be located virtually anywhere one <br>
could imagine, which means that the space allocation and unit <br>
cost per area (construction / maintenance / retrofit) factors <br>
will be contributing to ongoing budgetary planning and decision <br>
making and savings.<br>
 <br>
·	The virtually maintenance free design and overall <br>
simplicity of the pre-manufactured enclosure, offers a monetary <br>
advantage, reduces the installation &amp; labor component time <br>
frames, project management, engineering costs and other <br>
environmental factors that could be site specific.<br>
<br>
·	Our studies have shown that typical savings approach <br>
25%, when compared with the conventional alternative. A <br>
growing number of established Consulting Engineering firms are <br>
in constant contact with us as they examine &amp; propose our <br>
alternative solutions or specify them outright. <br>

            FUTURE CHANGE  THE SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGE<br>
<br>
<br>
In order to advance the technological requirements of the <br>
anticipated future trends on universal energy demands, the need <br>
for focused research and identification of practical solutions <br>
must drive the process. A R TECH identified some major factors <br>
that lead to the development of a unique substation concept and <br>
design that will revolutionize today and tomorrows distribution <br>
practices. Our research and development towards addressing those <br>
needs originated in 1994.  Several conclusions were extracted <br>
from the many sources available. Our response to the looming <br>
crises is summarized as follows:<br>
<br>
·	An increase in the developing worlds population will <br>
translate into sustainability problems, based on elevated <br>
electrical loads in both residential and industrial <br>
applications. This translates into ongoing demand, increased <br>
shortages and the inability of many countries to respond <br>
adequately.<br>
<br>
·	The demand for electrical distribution and <br>
infrastructure expansion is expected to grow at increasingly <br>
accelerated rates. A way must be found to reduce capital costs <br>
to allow for a lower cost per unit value, to maximize the <br>
potential to meet that demand.<br>
<br>
·	The need for the development of more compact <br>
substations, amongst other desired technological advances, must <br>
alter the existing strategies for established engineering, <br>
implementation and distribution concepts and practices. (There <br>
must be a better way / better ways?)<br>
<br>
·	A preference for pre-connected cables, pre-manufactured, <br>
integrated assemblies and state of the art approaches must be a <br>
major contributing factor to problem solving, cost reduction, <br>
technological advantage and change.<br>
<br>
·	An expanded use of SF6 (sulfur hexaflouride ) gas <br>
insulation has been identified as environmentally safe, a major <br>
advantage in design, and desirable, offering reduced maintenance <br>
costs and superior life cycle performance of load break <br>
switching.<br>
<br>
·	Oil filled / padmount transformers are a proven design. <br>
Traditionally, there were some environmental factors (PCBs or <br>
other leakage implications) that could have limited their <br>
selection or appeal. In order to maximize their appeal, the <br>
ability to install them in non-fire rated environments would <br>
benefit a significant sector of any economy. R-Temp oil (LNAN), <br>
a substitute for the standard transformer oil fill, satisfies <br>
that need, since it is non-toxic, inflammable and <br>
environmentally safe, as an alternative.<br>
<br>
·	The distribution grid in many countries is already <br>
incapable of satisfying existing demands, or the existing <br>
infrastructure, from a future perspective, will need to be <br>
rebuilt with environmentally friendly and cost saving <br>
strategies, as a minimum.<br>
<br>
·	Ongoing research from international think tanks, <br>
statistical data, trade analysis, import / export opportunities <br>
and economic outlooks require constant scrutiny by consulting <br>
varied reports or publications. The political consequences of <br>
energy shortages, privatization attempts, monopolistic <br>
resistance to change or other territorial specifics, are <br>
significant factors to monitor. This analysis, which must be <br>
available on a timely basis, is key to predicting probable <br>
results or opportunities within various political and geographic <br>
trading blocks. <br>
<br>
·	Political models, institutions, trade negotiations, <br>
workable agreements and market accessibility to foreign market <br>
sectors will be determining factors in the global energy <br>
challenge towards demand growth, stable economies and markets, <br>
environmental impact and strategic planning.<br>

international sources that are publicly available in varied <br>

<br>
A SOLUTION<br>
<br>
<br>
A R TECH created our unique MiniSub to address our own domestic <br>
marketplace, while recognizing the fact that our strategic <br>
exporting component has satisfied the very need thats already <br>
been highlighted.  <br>
<br>
The MiniSub substation is manufactured under our other Canadian <br>
corporation, POWER SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY (LTD). Consult the <br>
following section to see the engineering highlights and options <br>
that make this state of the art, high technology unit, the <br>
revolutionary distribution alternative.<br>
<br>
The MINISUB:<br>
<br>
Power Systems Technology has developed a new concept in unit <br>
substation design which brings together the unique benefits of <br>
oil / liquid filled padmount transformers as defined by the CSA <br>
specification C227.4, and SF6 switching technology using the Arc-<br>
Whipper© three position switch. <br>
<br>
With all these advantages: <br>
<br>
·	Compact size is only slightly larger than a padmount <br>
transformer. This unit can house up to 3 load break primary <br>
disconnects, fusing, secondary metering and distribution. <br>
<br>
·	Primary load break switches offer gas filled technology <br>
to provide maintenance-free service for the life of the unit. <br>
<br>
·	Interconnecting components of the switching to the <br>
transformer allow the switches to be unplugged from the <br>
transformer in minutes. <br>
<br>
·	All the primary compartments are submersible. There are <br>
no live parts, including the cable connections! <br>
<br>
·	Provision for grounding of any switch.<br>
<br>
·	Available in an automatic transfer from 2 primary feeds.<br>
 <br>
·	Available with Industry Canada approved metering. <br>
<br>
·	Secondary can accommodate a wide range of breaker <br>
arrangements. <br>
<br>
·	Designed to meet the requirements of non-utility <br>
operated equipment. <br>
<br>
·	Completely tamperproof and weatherproof. <br>

<br>
Visible Break Conforms to widely accepted operating safety <br>
practice, giving clear visual confirmation of contact position <br>
of ALL THREE PHASES through the viewing windows in the tank. The <br>
large open gap allows field voltage testing without cable <br>
removal. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Manual, Remote or Automatic Switching:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper©, is equipped for manual operation as standard and <br>
includes: External handles for operation by hand; quick <br>
make/break spring operators; bushing oriented line diagram; <br>
positive position indicators; padlock provisions; and operating <br>
instructions. Remote operation can also be optionally provided. <br>
Motor operators with pushbutton(s) or SCADA  (Supervisory <br>
Control and Data Acquisition) control are possible approaches. <br>
Automatic transfer switches use fast acting motor operators with <br>
voltage / current sensing and full function control. Units are <br>
factory wired and adjusted.<br>
<br>
Construction Features:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper©, SF6 load-break switches are ruggedly constructed, <br>
incorporate proven design and are rated/tested in accordance <br>
with ANSI standards C37.71-1984 and C37.72-1987 for long life <br>
with minimal maintenance. Switch contacts are equipped with very <br>
high speed auxiliary arcing contacts to quickly interrupt in ¼ <br>
to ½ cycle, leaving main contact surfaces undamaged by arcing. <br>
The arcing contact allows main contacts to be designed for high <br>
continuous, fault close and momentary current performance. <br>
Switches are factory filled with non-toxic, non-flammable, high <br>
dielectric SF6 gas insulation. SF6 quality and stability are <br>
maintained by use of totally sealed tank construction, an <br>
internal purifying absorbent and the extremely fast Arc-<br>
Whipper©  interrupter. A color coded, field replaceable pressure <br>
gauge and self-sealing fill valve allow monitoring and addition <br>
of SF6 as necessary. <br>
<br>
Switch tanks are ¼ thick steel with a highly corrosion / <br>
abrasion resistant 5 mil epoxy finish. External fittings and <br>
fasteners are marine grade stainless steel or bronze. For <br>
increased corrosion resistance, stainless steel tanks can be <br>
provided. Current carrying parts are high conductivity <br>
electrolytic grade copper with plating, locking fasteners, and <br>
torque wrench assembly to assure permanent low resistance <br>
connections. Moving contacts are self-aligning, self cleaning <br>
(wiping type) and designed to increase contact pressure with <br>
increasing currents. Contact assemblies are supported by high <br>
strength, molded glass polyester insulation with flex connectors <br>
at critical locations to prevent stressing and misaligning due <br>
to high current or mechanical forces. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Application Information:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper© SF6 load-break switches are completely submersible, <br>
fully dead-front, and corrosion resistant for application in the <br>
harshest conditions including areas subject to flooding, severe <br>
contamination, rodents and snakes, blowing snow/dust, sea <br>
coasts, high altitude, and even Division 2 hazardous locations. <br>
Non-toxic, non-flammable SF6 insulation permits installation <br>
indoors or outdoors in high traffic areas. Compact size and <br>
reduced weight provide solutions where overall space is <br>
important such as in high-rise buildings, front lot lines and in <br>
small vaults. <br>
<br>
Switch Operators and Options:<br>
<br>
Arc-Whipper©  SF6 load break switches are equipped with external <br>
handles for manual operation as standard. The handle can be <br>
padlocked in all switch positions and has an anti-reversing <br>
feature for additional safety. Interlocks can be provided <br>
as may be required by local practice and for increased safety. <br>
In addition, remote/SCADA and fully automatic operators are <br>
available for increased levels of control and system automation. <br>
These motor operators attach to the switch handle and may be <br>
easily disconnected for manual operation. <br>
<br>
Manual Operation:<br>
<br>
The handles are removable and can be attached to the switch-<br>
operating shaft through an arc of 360 degrees, in 45degree <br>
increments, for maximum mechanical advantage during operation or <br>
may be removed and stored on the pad-lockable hanger bracket <br>
when not in use. Rotating the handle toward the desired position <br>
causes quick make / break, spring operated contact movement <br>
independent of the operating handle movement. Latches prevent <br>
contact blow off and provide positive position indication. <br>
Additional features include: padlock provisions in all <br>
positions, bushing oriented line diagram and instructions. Three <br>
position switches are equipped with anti-pass through provisions <br>
to prevent inadvertent operation to the third position. <br>
<br>
Key Interlocks:<br>
<br>
Are available as required to prevent paralleling feeders or to <br>
limit access to energized equipment or to otherwise coordinate <br>
proper system operation. Key-locks are mounted on the specified <br>
switched ways with locking provided for the required position. <br>
<br>
Automatic Load Transfer Switches:<br>
<br>
The MiniSub is ideal for maintaining power to critical loads <br>
such as hospitals, airports, shopping centers, and industrial <br>
facilities. Upon loss of preferred primary feeder voltage, the <br>
load is automatically transferred to an alternate source. <br>
Optional automatic retransfer, over current detection and fault <br>
isolation provide additional system flexibility. Units include <br>
fast acting 120 VAC motor operators attached to the switch <br>
operating handles. Voltage sensing is done through a set of <br>
elbow mounted detectors and relay combination which supply data <br>
to the full function automatic control with self-contained 120 <br>
VAC/24VDC control power source. All items are factory assembled, <br>
wired, adjusted, and tested for simplified installation and <br>
operation. <br>
<br>
Visible Break, Make and Ground:<br>
<br>
Each switched way is equipped with a viewing window for clear, <br>
visual confirmation and assurance of contact position of ALL <br>
PHASES. Conforms to local code and operation practices, which <br>
require visible break and (where equipped) visible grounding <br>
during system operation, maintenance, repair, or testing. <br>
<br>
Anti-reverse Operating Handles:<br>
<br>
Eliminate the possibility of interrupting currents beyond the <br>
capability of the switch by preventing immediate operation after <br>
closing on a fault. A latch on the operating handle must be <br>
reset prior to subsequent operation allowing upstream circuit <br>
protection time to clear the fault. <br>
<br>
Primary Cable Terminations: <br>
<br>
ANSI/IEEE standard 386 defines the specific interfaces <br>
dimensions that 200 and 600 amp, elbows, inserts and equipment <br>
bushings must conform to insure interchangeability. The 200 amp <br>
load break, and 600 amp non load break connectors provide a <br>
convenient and safe way to connect all primary cables. With the <br>
use of a Raychem PILC kit, lead cables can be <br>
connected using the same style. While the cables and <br>
terminations are barriered from access, the elbow test point <br>
offers an additional security and safety, as well as a voltage <br>
reference for automatic or SCADA type operations This <br>
termination provides a dead front waterproof connection. <br>
<br>
<br>
THE TRANSFORMER:<br>
<br>
Power Systems Technology has chosen to use the basic padmount <br>
transformer design, which is a proven technology since the <br>
1970s. This transformer design offers an economic and reliable <br>
package and making the overall appearance very acceptable. <br>
<br>
All transformers used with the Power Systems MiniSubä are built <br>
to the CSA C227.4 M1978 specification, and conforms to CSA C802 <br>
specification for efficiency and losses. Transformer sizes are <br>
available from 150 KVA up to 3000 KVA in 5 to 34.5 kV range. <br>
This gives a very broad range of application for the MiniSubä. <br>
<br>
Transformers are available in standard transformer oil (ONAN), <br>
or R-temp oil (LNAN) for installation in non-fire rated <br>
environments. Our transformer designs are also built to meet <br>
ANSI/IEEE C57.92-1981 guide for loading of oil filled <br>
transformers 55°C or 65°C rise, which allows for up to 30% <br>
overload. <br>
<br>
Transformer Standard Accessories:<br>
·	Fuse Protection <br>
·	Liquid temperature gauge <br>
·	Liquid level gauge <br>
·	Pressure relief device <br>
·	Fill and drain valve <br>
·	Transformer riveted cover <br>
·	Tap switch and off load 5 position changer <br>
·	Copper ground bar in both HV and LV compartments <br>
·	Lifting and jacking devices <br>
·	Spare fuse holder <br>
·	Tamperproof design with secure hinges and lockable <br>
handle. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bay-O-Net Fusing:<br>
<br>
All Power Systems MiniSubs are equipped with a system of Bay-O-<br>
Net and current limiting fuse assemblies in a two fuse <br>
protection scheme, with the current limiting fuse as the backup. <br>
In this arrangement, secondary faults and overload currents are <br>
cleared by the Bay-O-Net fuse. High level faults caused by <br>
internal failure is cleared by the CL fuse. The two fuses are <br>
connected in series. If a CL fuse is not required, an isolation <br>
link is provided. <br>
<br>
Access to the Bay-O-Net use is restricted by a metal cover over <br>
the fuse holders which is key interlocked with the Arc-Whipper© <br>
switch, to be sure that power is in the off position prior to <br>
assessing the fuses. <br>
<br>
<br>
Note: The application of internal fusing in voltages at 25kV and <br>
above can only be done in a wye primary connected design. The <br>
load on the transformer cannot exceed more than 50% delta <br>
connected secondary loads. Certain condition of ferrule <br>
resonance can exist at these voltages and the application of <br>
lightning arrestors should be considered. <br>
<br>
<br>
THE CONNECTION:<br>
<br>
This unique connection between the SF6 switch and the <br>
transformer allows the switch(es) to be plugged in for a <br>
watertight connection. This feature allows the switch to be <br>
removed in the field for service, if required. A transformer can <br>
be replaced with this method in a few hours. This connection <br>
maintains the submersible criteria of the MiniSub unit.<br>
<br>
Low Voltage Compartment: <br>
<br>
There are a wide variety of accessories available in the <br>
secondary compartment. This is specific to each project and <br>
designers needs. This can include: <br>
<br>
·	Digital metering for customers or utilities. <br>
·	Separate metering access door <br>
·	Main Breakers <br>
·	Ground fault protection <br>
·	Feeder Breakers <br>

MINISUB   SUMMARY OF COST BENEFITS:<br>
<br>
<br>
It becomes inevitable that we examine the cost factors, in terms <br>
of real and potential savings, based on capital cost <br>
expenditures and long term maintenance factors. If we look at <br>
the conventional methods of providing the service entrance and <br>
distribution requirements / components, then it will be assumed <br>
that the methodology, pricing factors, typical or special <br>
considerations and space requirements are well known. <br>
<br>
If we now look at the new concept proposed in this section, then <br>
the basic premise of where areas of savings can be identified, <br>
can be elaborated on, as shown in the following list:<br>
<br>
·	The LOOP switching design offers a distributed model <br>
where you eliminate the main electrical vault(s) and the <br>
extensive cable routing that results from a central distribution <br>
model.<br>
<br>
·	Reduced sources of electrical noise, specifically, EMI <br>
(electro-magnetic interference) &amp; RFI (radio frequency <br>
interference) and the costs associated with reducing or <br>
eliminating these problems (where applicable).<br>
<br>
·	A SINGLE main incoming electrical feeder is the only <br>
(primary) cabling required to a building structure or site <br>
complex.<br>
<br>
·	MiniSubs LOOP together, meaning that the primary feed <br>
can be daisy chained from one unit to the next. Through a <br>
special switching design, each / any / all of the MiniSubs can <br>
operate independently of each other, regardless of the status of <br>
any single / local MiniSub in the network.<br>
<br>
·	The MiniSub could be located virtually anywhere one <br>
could imagine, which means that the space allocation and unit <br>
cost per area (construction / maintenance / retrofit) factors <br>
will be contributing to ongoing budgetary planning and decision <br>
making and savings.<br>
 <br>
·	The virtually maintenance free design and overall <br>
simplicity of the pre-manufactured enclosure, offers a monetary <br>
advantage, reduces the installation &amp; labor component time <br>
frames, project management, engineering costs and other <br>
environmental factors that could be site specific.<br>
<br>
·	Our studies have shown that typical savings approach <br>
25%, when compared with the conventional alternative. A <br>
growing number of established Consulting Engineering firms are <br>
in constant contact with us as they examine &amp; propose our <br>
alternative solutions or specify them outright. <br>
