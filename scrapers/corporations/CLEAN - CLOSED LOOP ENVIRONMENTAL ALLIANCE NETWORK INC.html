An example of this is C.L.E.A.N.&#39;s unique and proprietary CLOSED LOOP SOLVENT RECYCLING SYSTEM for blanket wash in the Print and Graphics industry.<br><br>C.L.E.A.N. also provides a variety of products and services through its alliance partners and distributors, such as Absorbent and Spill Containment Products, Environmental Waste Auditors, Training, Emergency Response, Hazardous and Non Hazardous Waste Management and Reclamation services all under one roof. <br><br>C.L.E.A.N. chooses its partners carefully making sure that they meet the highest of standards for their clients and customers. C.L.E.A.N.&#39;s alliance partners are ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 registered and their commitment to the environment is a number one priority.<br><br>THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PLAYERS in the Environmental industry are defined by both the quality of their work and the range of added value their companies can bring to their customers. C.L.E.A.N.&#39;s alliance partners are an excellent investment. But actually developing this full range of Environmental products and services to make it a reality in your company is a complex and all-consuming process, especially for most companies trying to do it themselves.

                            NEW GENERATION LOW POLLUTION ADDITIVES FOR FUEL<br>
BENEFITING THE ENVIRONMENT.<br>
ALL THE MATERIALS IN THESE FUEL ADDITIVES ARE MADE<br>
FROM RECYCLED WASTE STREAMS.<br>
<br>
C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives are a new , innovative, patented technology that produce extremely low polluting fuel additives for consumer and commercial use. This low polluting fuel additive technology has been proven through consistent testing and verification by Environment Canada&#39;s Emissions Testing Centre as well as on the race track where in its first full year of use it was used to power a race team to the Overall Points Championship for 2003 in the Thunder Car Series.<br>
<br>
C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives Inc. has been able to develop fuels that are produced with the protection of people and the environment in mind by using recycled waste materials and bio components while reducing toxic components of gasoline such as cancer causing benzene. C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives are a clean burning lower polluting additive for gasoline that consist of a blend of naphtha and various oxygenates. It was successfully marketed in Japan over the last four years, and sold through an everexpanding network of retail service stations.<br>
<br>
All tests have demonstrated that C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives reduce the emission of several harmful pollutants and Green House Gases (GHGs - CO, CO2, NOx &amp; THC) emitted from motor vehicles while increasing performance and mileage. These results have been demonstrated on the road in Japan and confirmed in tests at Environment Canada facilities here in Canada. Report ERMD 01-26 concluded: &quot;The exhaust emission results indicate a statistically significant reduction in average composite CO, CO2, THC as well as fuel consumption(and) the HWFCT emission results and fuel consumption indicated a statistically significant reduction using C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives.&quot; In a typical city driving simulation, C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives reduce total harmful emissions (CO, CO2, NOX &amp; THC) by a minimum of 5.5% and at best by 46.9%. Similar tests in highway driving conditions, demonstrated reduction of total emissions from 6 to 88% compared to gasoline.<br>
<br>
NOW, C.L.E.A.N. POWER ADDITIVES ARE READY FOR THE WORLD &amp; NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS!<br>

                            NEW GENERATION LOW POLLUTION ADDITIVES FOR FUEL<br>
BENEFITING THE ENVIRONMENT.<br>
ALL THE MATERIALS IN THESE FUEL ADDITIVES ARE MADE<br>
FROM RECYCLED WASTE STREAMS.<br>
<br>
C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives are a new , innovative, patented technology that produce extremely low polluting fuel additives for consumer and commercial use. This low polluting fuel additive technology has been proven through consistent testing and verification by Environment Canada&#39;s Emissions Testing Centre as well as on the race track where in its first full year of use it was used to power a race team to the Overall Points Championship for 2003 in the Thunder Car Series.<br>
<br>
C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives Inc. has been able to develop fuels that are produced with the protection of people and the environment in mind by using recycled waste materials and bio components while reducing toxic components of gasoline such as cancer causing benzene. C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives are a clean burning lower polluting additive for gasoline that consist of a blend of naphtha and various oxygenates. It was successfully marketed in Japan over the last four years, and sold through an everexpanding network of retail service stations.<br>
<br>
All tests have demonstrated that C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives reduce the emission of several harmful pollutants and Green House Gases (GHGs - CO, CO2, NOx &amp; THC) emitted from motor vehicles while increasing performance and mileage. These results have been demonstrated on the road in Japan and confirmed in tests at Environment Canada facilities here in Canada. Report ERMD 01-26 concluded: &quot;The exhaust emission results indicate a statistically significant reduction in average composite CO, CO2, THC as well as fuel consumption(and) the HWFCT emission results and fuel consumption indicated a statistically significant reduction using C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives.&quot; In a typical city driving simulation, C.L.E.A.N. Power Additives reduce total harmful emissions (CO, CO2, NOX &amp; THC) by a minimum of 5.5% and at best by 46.9%. Similar tests in highway driving conditions, demonstrated reduction of total emissions from 6 to 88% compared to gasoline.<br>
<br>
NOW, C.L.E.A.N. POWER ADDITIVES ARE READY FOR THE WORLD &amp; NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS!<br>
