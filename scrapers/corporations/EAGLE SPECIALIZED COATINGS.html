                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
RUSTGRIP ® is a one-part polyurethane coating that combines with atmospheric moisture to cure. Upon curing, RUSTGRIP ® provides a protective coating of superior adhesion, flexibility and abrasion / impact resistance. It is resistant to chemical solvents and acid splash. Originally designed for metal surfaces, RUSTGRIP ® demonstrates excellent adhesion to wood, concrete, fiberglass and many other substrates. RUSTGRIP ® is designed for the encapsulation of and adherence to tightly bonded surfaces of lead based and other toxic paints and materials as well as rusted surfaces. This unique ability is accomplished by the curing mechanism of the base polymer. The coating ( having a low initial viscosity ) wets the rusty surface, then penetrates to the foundation of the rust&#39;s origin where curing begins. RUSTGRIP ® actually becomes part of the substrate unlike a surface coating which just bonds on top. The polymer literally begins to swell, developing an interlocking network between the pores of the surface and the coating. RUSTGRIP is highly recommended as a primer coat for SUPERTHERM ® . No pot life, no catalyzation, no two-part mixing. RUSTGRIP ® is not a sacrificial rust inhibitor such as a zinc enriched primer that will wear out over time but in fact a permanent rust proofing which is why it is a certified ( ASTM E1795 ) Biohazard Encapsulator. RUSTGRIP ® has also passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which are marine specifications and consequently has achieved DNV certification. Can substitute for zinc-rich primer requiring no white sandblasting. Can be applied over rusted surfaces after loose \ flaking material is removed. High humidity quickens dry \ cure cycle.<br>
<br>
The difference between a surface coating and RUSTGRIP ®!<br>
<br>
A surface coating does not have the special solvent carrier to allow it to enter the pores of a substrate and carry the body of the coating into the pores with it. The surface coating will bite into anything above the pore area and adhere to the surface by attaching to any roughness. This works well in most areas until the surface of the coating is exposed to weathering and other elements over time allowing oxidation and acid rain to enter through its pin holes and begin the migration of corrosion.<br>
<br>
RUSTGRIP ® is made with special solvent carriers that allow the coating to penetrate into the pores carrying the body of the coating with it. Once the body of the coating is in the pores, it begins to absorb the moisture from the atmosphere and gases itself or does a microscopic swell inside the pores that anchors it into the metal or any other surface. This action does allow the coating to become part of the actual surface which is different than all other industrial coatings. Also, its high molecular weight allows the coating to become extremely tough. Being an aromatic urethane in nature, it is already extremely resistant to acids. Its non-leafing metallics allow an encapsulation of the surface and adds additional toughness and UV control to its surface.<br>
<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
SUPERTHERM ® is a unique single component combination of high performance aliphatic urethanes, elastomeric acrylics, standard acrylics and resin additives in a water borne formula. No co-solvents are present and will dry by evaporation. Due to the unique combination of acrylics and urethanes, SUPERTHERM ® cures out completely in 14 - 21 days to an extremely tough, durable, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that also provides flexibility, water proofing and UV stability. SUPERTHERM ® has passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which equals marine specifications and in fact has DNV certification. SUPERTHERM ® was built to meet the requirements of industrial uses which required a tough surface, and provide flexibility against stresses of contraction and expansion. Also, unlike all other &quot;reflective&quot; paints on the market which offer only a single reflective ceramic to provide heat reflection, SUPERTHERM ® is designed with four separate ceramic compounds for insulation from radiant heat, reflection, conduction and convection. SUPERTHERM ® ceramics are not the rough multifaceted type as the one found in other coatings, SUPERTHERM ® ceramics are ground to form microscopic spheres. The spherical shape permits the 4 types of ceramics to settle very tight together, not allowing air to interact between the ceramics; thus &quot;plating&quot;. SUPERTHERM ® multi~ceramic insulation coating blocks 96% of the three sources of heat - visual light, ultra violet rays and infrared rays. Therefore, SUPERTHERM ® is a true &quot; insulating &quot; coating and not just a reflective paint as are all the competing formulas in the market. Also tested by the Thermo Physical Research Laboratory for comparative R19 equivalent insulation factor SUPERTHERM ® blocked 92% of the heat. No other R19 equivalent insulator can claim that!. No Fiberglass, No Foam, No Cellulose, No other single ceramic paint!<br>
<br>
~ Two ceramic compounds are primarily to repel radiation and offer reflective abilities. These two ceramics repel better than 95% of the sunlight and radiant heat ( short wave ).<br>
<br>
~ The third ceramic compound is to stop 92% heat and / or cold conduction by hollow sphere technology which is not glass. <br>
<br>
~ The fourth ceramic compound is designed specifically for stopping infrared radiated heat. This ceramic blocks 99.5% of Infrared Radiation ( long wave ) to control the heat gain or loss to the envelope of buildings or equipment. This new compound was introduced in February 2000 as part of our continued research in controlling heat transfer.<br>
<br>
~ The combination of acrylics provide elasticity and adhesion while the urethane adds toughness, binds the acrylics and compounds and also provides a moisture barrier. The fourth resin additive is what makes the complete resin blend to combine into a single component and extends the life of the coating. This resin / ceramic combination has been shown to repel both heat and fire, withstand elements for 30 to 40 years, endure 180 degree bend without cracking, resist water, acid rain and ultraviolet light. SUPERTHERM ® is a permanently flexible &quot;breathable&quot; membrane that stops water penetration and prevents corrosion and surface deterioration.<br>

Reduction of BTU conduction through a steel plate from 367.2 to 3.99 at a thickness of 10 mils DFT ( 10/1000 &quot; ) This reduction is written for steel, concrete or any other substrate material.<br>
The combination of reflectivity, emmissivity and thermal conductivity equals R19 ( ASTM C236 )<br>
&quot;R&quot; Value improvement ratio: ASTM C236 test verified that using SUPERTHERM ® over an existing &quot;R&quot; value material will enhance the total of the &quot;R&quot; value performance of the system. The control fiber glass board tested to K=0.52. When SUPERTHERM ® was applied at the standard 10 mils dry, the certified improvement to the &quot;R&quot; value was 68%. One coat each at 10 mils of SUPERTHERM ® applied to opposite sides of the same &quot;R&quot; rated material improved the &quot;R&quot; performance by 148%. Therefore, based upon the 68% improvement ratio, a minimum of R13 material or system can be improved to R21.8 by applying one coat of SUPERTHERM ®.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® is a unique blend of eight different ceramic compounds chosen out of over 6 years of research and 1000&#39;s of compounds that combine and work together to form a heat block against extreme heat migration. Since the coating surface will come in direct contact with flame, a char enhancer was added to form a small char on the surface. This is not an intumiscent coating, but instead, a pliable film that reacts to flame. When the char forms, it brings the ceramics up and into the char to allow the char to be tough and remain in place during actual fire conditions. This coating is a ceramic hybrid that is unique to the industry. It is not fragile, it becomes surface hard; and because of the ceramics, it will continue to insulate against extreme heat migration during a direct or indirect fire. Whatever surface is covered with this coating is able to offer extreme heat insulation through any substrate coated. This coating is designed to stay intact with constant adhesion above 2000F.<br>
<br>
The competing fire protection materials are either : <br>
<br>
Intumiscent paints which are applied thinly but when activated become fragile after expanding out to meet the flame. Intumiscent coatings swell upon contact with fire and form a char that is extremely lightweight and fragile, leaving them susceptible to damage during a fire from strong winds, flying debris and sprinkler systems. Once the char is brushed off, the existence of fire protection is eliminated. Cleanup of all surface areas (direct and indirect exposure) is extensive from the swelled coating. <br>
<br>
Cementious materials which must be trowled on over wire mesh - which is time-consuming in its application and inflexible in its finished state making them very expensive to apply and have poor appearance. Some will emit toxic fumes during a fire. <br>
<br>
Cellulose materials are blown-on and look like a shag rug on the surface. Cellulose materials are somewhat fragile, subject to surface damage and will be affected over time by condensation and humidity, leading to adhesion loss. World Trade Center report - Blaze key to collapse<br>
<br>
<br>
In other situations, two wallboard sections - Type X ( 5/8 inch thick - 14mm each ) are nailed together to provide fire protection. This is labour intensive and impractical in most major construction areas.<br>
<br>
Unlike most fire barriers requiring 2-3 inches thickness (50-70mm), OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ®FIRE&amp;reg (SP2001F) requires only 250-400 mils DFT ( 6 to 10 mm ) to provide fire protection. , OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® relies upon the dense combination of eight ceramic compounds to catch the heat of the flame. When flames contact the face of the coating, it begins a glazing or surface hardening that becomes tough while sealing off any pores to heat, smoke or gas passages. When the coating surface completely hardens, it forms a solid block against heat conduction. The OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® will set hard and hold constant for the duration of the fire. <br>
<br>
In summary OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® is an extremely versatile high temperature insulation and fire protection coating that offers itself to uses across all industrial, commercial and residential boundaries. The fact that it is easy to apply, water based, nontoxic and remains flexible until used, makes this coating a promising choice for those with high temperature, insulation and fire protection needs.<br>

                            HOT PIPE COATING ® is a unique combination of high performance specialy designed high-temperature resins in a waterborne formula. This coating will dry slowly by evaporation and can be aided in the dry down by adding high heat to the environment. The product remains flexible when dried. HOT PIPE COATING ® was built to be used as the initial primer coating and high build coating applied over hot pipes or other high temperature surfaces to achieve immediate adhesion while calming down the hot surface. Using this coating as the primer and base coat, we can achieve adhesion over the hot surface and create a surface that is insulated to stop heat flow. It is waterborne to offer a nonflammable, non toxic formula for high heat situations. HOT PIPE COATING ® has proven to save better than 35% of fuel consumption insulating high temperature steam pipes with no risk of corrosion under insulation (CUI).  For temperature ranges up to 700°F \ 370°C as well as sub zero environments.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
HOT SURFACE COATING ® (HSC ®) is specifically engineered to control hot surface temperatures ranging between 65°C - 177 °C / 150 °F - 350°F. It is lightweight and smooth in appearance. This is a water-borne system using a special acrylic blend with specific ceramic compounds to provide the non-conductive block against heat transfer without depending upon reflectivity. The coating will dry down on a cold surface by evaporation and can be aided in the dry down by adding heat to the environment. If the surface is already heated, the dry-down process will take care of itself without additional steps required.<br>
<br>
HSC ® is water-borne to offer a non-flammable, non-toxic formula for medium heat surface applications over standard steam pipes, oven wall construction and other hot surfaces. This coating was designed for applications whose temperature exposures falls bellow that requires HOT PIPE COATING ® ( up to 700°F / 370°C). HSC ® is more easily applied for a smoother finish. <br>
<br>
HSC ® can be applied over metal, concrete, wood or all surfaces not glazed or containing polypropylene (having no pores). <br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION :<br>
SAFECOAT LATEX ® Fire Retardant Coating is a single component latex-based, intumescent fire retardant coating ideally suited for interior applications to SPF Plywood (Spruce/Pine/Fir), Oriented Strand Board (OSB), wood trusses and rough stud construction, where Flame Spread Ratings of 25 or less (&quot;Class A&quot; or Class 1) and low Smoke Developed Ratings are required. It limits flame spread by expanding to many times the original dry film thickness when exposed to heat. This expanded material forms a char which insulates the substrate against heat, and reduces available oxygen to the surface, thus limiting flame spread to a &quot;CLASS A&quot; rating on OSB, SPF plywood and Douglas Fir Decking as tested under ASTM E84-91a and CAN4-S102-M88 standards in a single coat application sprayed at 150 ft USG. SAFECOAT Latex dries quickly to a flat (matte) finish, having the appearance of conventional flat paint.<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS : <br>
imparts a Class A Flame Spread Rating to dimensional lumber, plywood and Oriented Strand Board (OSB).<br>
acts as a thermal barrier to protect foamed plastic insulation when used in conjunction with OSB.<br>

SAFECOAT EXTERIOR ® is an acrylic, solvent based paint which can be used in exterior or interior applications to achieve a flame spread of less than 25. SAFECOAT EXTERIOR ® is an intumescent fire retardant coating ideally suited for exterior and interior applications to SPF Plywood (Spruce/Pine/Fir), wood trusses and rough stud construction, where Flame Spread Ratings of 25 or less (&quot;Class A&quot; or Class 1) and low Smoke Developed Ratings are required. It is especially effective where exposure to moisture and UV radiation is a concern or coating is subject to repeated cleaning. It limits flame spread by expanding to many times the original dry film thickness when exposed to heat. This expanded material forms a char which insulates the substrate against heat, and reduces available oxygen to the surface, thus limiting flame spread to a &quot;CLASS A&quot;, on SPF plywood, as tested under CAN4-S102-M88 standards, in a single coat application sprayed at 150 sf \ USG.<br>
<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS : <br>
o imparts a Class A Flame Spread Rating to dimensional lumber and plywood which is subject to the elements or is subject to repeated cleaning or used in lieu of drywall on plywood and OSB for greater strength and resilience.<br>
o replace sprinklers in combustible concealed spaces, under NFPA-13.<br>
o can be applied as a mandatory upgrade to assist owners and property managers to meet the latest fire and building code requirements. It may also be applied as a voluntary upgrade to lower fire risks and reduce insurance costs.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION :<br>
SAFECOAT E-84 ® is a single component latex-based, intumescent fire retardant coating intended for interior use on polyurethane foam (for exterior applications use Safecoat Exterior). It dries to an opaque flat finish similar to a conventional flat latex. When exposed to the heat of a fire, SAFECOAT E-84 ® intumesces (swells up) to form a thick protective insulating barrier against heat and flames. It is tintable, non-toxic, washable, convenient, labor saving and environmentally friendly. SAFECOAT E-84 ® can be used to achieve a Class A Flame Spread Rating on many polyurethane foam substrates.<br>
<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS: <br>
o Use to achieve a Class A flame spread rating and a low smoke developed rating, on high density polyurethane molded parts.<br>
o it may also be applied to polyurethane spray foam and most wood substrates.<br>
o when used in polyurethane mold applications, use of BARRIERCOAT 840 as a barrier and release agent ensures compatibility and improves flame resistance.<br>
o If the coated substrate will be subject to repeated washing or prolonged contact with moisture, a finishing coat of SAFECOAT 725 ® is recommended. Before applying any other finishing coat, consult the manufacturer or their representative.<br>
<br>
<br>
TEST RESULTS: <br>
Testing was conducted by independent polyurethane molding producers in accordance with ASTM E84-91a &quot;Standard Method of Test for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials and Assemblies&quot;. A coverage rate of approximately 80 sq/ft per USGallon is suggested to achieve a &quot;Class A&quot; rating.<br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Two identical ice arenas, pre-engineered stress skin metal buildings by Colony Buildings were built by a general contractor the Lark Group , at the same time. One in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Surrey, British Columbia. SUPERTHERM ® is the sole insulation applied to the exterior of the walls only as recommended by Lark Group, Project Manager Kirk Fisher.<br>
<br>
The Director of National Training Rinks, Dwayne Lowdermilk provided the following written comments with regards to the Surrey facility, &quot;Excellent Ice&quot;: <br>
<br>
&quot;We are in the business of operating ice facilities and we have found by using this product (Supertherm) we had a thirty percent saving on our energy costs which we sure appreciate.  It is my experience that I can safely say this product meets its rate sheets and allowed us to present a great finished product&quot;<br>
<br>
The general contractor, Kirk E. Fisher, P.Eng., MBA of the Lark Group provided the following statements in a letter:  <br>
<br>
&quot;Further to our discussion, this letter will confirm the occurrences in Kirkland, Quebec, at our existing twin sheet ice arena.  In October of 1998 we applied 7 dry mils of Super Therm insulation coating to the exterior of our stress skin metal building.  Everyone in Kirkland was skeptical that the product would insulate the building due to the harsh climate.  After two years of operations I was convinced to insulate the building to see if the hydro and gas costs would be reduced.  The building has now been in operation for a further two years and I can tell you the hydro and gas bill did not change at all.  The application of $30,000 of additional insulation did nothing.  This of course re-affirmed my faith in your product and I have decided to use it on our Surrey expansion and all other future ice arena devellopments.&quot;<br>
<br>
Note: The added insulation is closed cell foam applied to the interior surface of the building.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
RUSTGRIP ® is a one-part polyurethane coating that combines with atmospheric moisture to cure. Upon curing, RUSTGRIP ® provides a protective coating of superior adhesion, flexibility and abrasion / impact resistance. It is resistant to chemical solvents and acid splash. Originally designed for metal surfaces, RUSTGRIP ® demonstrates excellent adhesion to wood, concrete, fiberglass and many other substrates. RUSTGRIP ® is designed for the encapsulation of and adherence to tightly bonded surfaces of lead based and other toxic paints and materials as well as rusted surfaces. This unique ability is accomplished by the curing mechanism of the base polymer. The coating ( having a low initial viscosity ) wets the rusty surface, then penetrates to the foundation of the rust&#39;s origin where curing begins. RUSTGRIP ® actually becomes part of the substrate unlike a surface coating which just bonds on top. The polymer literally begins to swell, developing an interlocking network between the pores of the surface and the coating. RUSTGRIP is highly recommended as a primer coat for SUPERTHERM ® . No pot life, no catalyzation, no two-part mixing. RUSTGRIP ® is not a sacrificial rust inhibitor such as a zinc enriched primer that will wear out over time but in fact a permanent rust proofing which is why it is a certified ( ASTM E1795 ) Biohazard Encapsulator. RUSTGRIP ® has also passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which are marine specifications and consequently has achieved DNV certification. Can substitute for zinc-rich primer requiring no white sandblasting. Can be applied over rusted surfaces after loose \ flaking material is removed. High humidity quickens dry \ cure cycle.<br>
<br>
The difference between a surface coating and RUSTGRIP ®!<br>
<br>
A surface coating does not have the special solvent carrier to allow it to enter the pores of a substrate and carry the body of the coating into the pores with it. The surface coating will bite into anything above the pore area and adhere to the surface by attaching to any roughness. This works well in most areas until the surface of the coating is exposed to weathering and other elements over time allowing oxidation and acid rain to enter through its pin holes and begin the migration of corrosion.<br>
<br>
RUSTGRIP ® is made with special solvent carriers that allow the coating to penetrate into the pores carrying the body of the coating with it. Once the body of the coating is in the pores, it begins to absorb the moisture from the atmosphere and gases itself or does a microscopic swell inside the pores that anchors it into the metal or any other surface. This action does allow the coating to become part of the actual surface which is different than all other industrial coatings. Also, its high molecular weight allows the coating to become extremely tough. Being an aromatic urethane in nature, it is already extremely resistant to acids. Its non-leafing metallics allow an encapsulation of the surface and adds additional toughness and UV control to its surface.<br>
<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
SUPERTHERM ® is a unique single component combination of high performance aliphatic urethanes, elastomeric acrylics, standard acrylics and resin additives in a water borne formula. No co-solvents are present and will dry by evaporation. Due to the unique combination of acrylics and urethanes, SUPERTHERM ® cures out completely in 14 - 21 days to an extremely tough, durable, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that also provides flexibility, water proofing and UV stability. SUPERTHERM ® has passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which equals marine specifications and in fact has DNV certification. SUPERTHERM ® was built to meet the requirements of industrial uses which required a tough surface, and provide flexibility against stresses of contraction and expansion. Also, unlike all other &quot;reflective&quot; paints on the market which offer only a single reflective ceramic to provide heat reflection, SUPERTHERM ® is designed with four separate ceramic compounds for insulation from radiant heat, reflection, conduction and convection. SUPERTHERM ® ceramics are not the rough multifaceted type as the one found in other coatings, SUPERTHERM ® ceramics are ground to form microscopic spheres. The spherical shape permits the 4 types of ceramics to settle very tight together, not allowing air to interact between the ceramics; thus &quot;plating&quot;. SUPERTHERM ® multi~ceramic insulation coating blocks 96% of the three sources of heat - visual light, ultra violet rays and infrared rays. Therefore, SUPERTHERM ® is a true &quot; insulating &quot; coating and not just a reflective paint as are all the competing formulas in the market. Also tested by the Thermo Physical Research Laboratory for comparative R19 equivalent insulation factor SUPERTHERM ® blocked 92% of the heat. No other R19 equivalent insulator can claim that!. No Fiberglass, No Foam, No Cellulose, No other single ceramic paint!<br>
<br>
~ Two ceramic compounds are primarily to repel radiation and offer reflective abilities. These two ceramics repel better than 95% of the sunlight and radiant heat ( short wave ).<br>
<br>
~ The third ceramic compound is to stop 92% heat and / or cold conduction by hollow sphere technology which is not glass. <br>
<br>
~ The fourth ceramic compound is designed specifically for stopping infrared radiated heat. This ceramic blocks 99.5% of Infrared Radiation ( long wave ) to control the heat gain or loss to the envelope of buildings or equipment. This new compound was introduced in February 2000 as part of our continued research in controlling heat transfer.<br>
<br>
~ The combination of acrylics provide elasticity and adhesion while the urethane adds toughness, binds the acrylics and compounds and also provides a moisture barrier. The fourth resin additive is what makes the complete resin blend to combine into a single component and extends the life of the coating. This resin / ceramic combination has been shown to repel both heat and fire, withstand elements for 30 to 40 years, endure 180 degree bend without cracking, resist water, acid rain and ultraviolet light. SUPERTHERM ® is a permanently flexible &quot;breathable&quot; membrane that stops water penetration and prevents corrosion and surface deterioration.<br>

The combination of reflectivity, emmissivity and thermal conductivity equals R19 ( ASTM C236 )<br>
&quot;R&quot; Value improvement ratio: ASTM C236 test verified that using SUPERTHERM ® over an existing &quot;R&quot; value material will enhance the total of the &quot;R&quot; value performance of the system. The control fiber glass board tested to K=0.52. When SUPERTHERM ® was applied at the standard 10 mils dry, the certified improvement to the &quot;R&quot; value was 68%. One coat each at 10 mils of SUPERTHERM ® applied to opposite sides of the same &quot;R&quot; rated material improved the &quot;R&quot; performance by 148%. Therefore, based upon the 68% improvement ratio, a minimum of R13 material or system can be improved to R21.8 by applying one coat of SUPERTHERM ®.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® is a unique blend of eight different ceramic compounds chosen out of over 6 years of research and 1000&#39;s of compounds that combine and work together to form a heat block against extreme heat migration. Since the coating surface will come in direct contact with flame, a char enhancer was added to form a small char on the surface. This is not an intumiscent coating, but instead, a pliable film that reacts to flame. When the char forms, it brings the ceramics up and into the char to allow the char to be tough and remain in place during actual fire conditions. This coating is a ceramic hybrid that is unique to the industry. It is not fragile, it becomes surface hard; and because of the ceramics, it will continue to insulate against extreme heat migration during a direct or indirect fire. Whatever surface is covered with this coating is able to offer extreme heat insulation through any substrate coated. This coating is designed to stay intact with constant adhesion above 2000F.<br>
<br>
The competing fire protection materials are either : <br>

Intumiscent paints which are applied thinly but when activated become fragile after expanding out to meet the flame. Intumiscent coatings swell upon contact with fire and form a char that is extremely lightweight and fragile, leaving them susceptible to damage during a fire from strong winds, flying debris and sprinkler systems. Once the char is brushed off, the existence of fire protection is eliminated. Cleanup of all surface areas (direct and indirect exposure) is extensive from the swelled coating. <br>

Cementious materials which must be trowled on over wire mesh - which is time-consuming in its application and inflexible in its finished state making them very expensive to apply and have poor appearance. Some will emit toxic fumes during a fire. <br>
<br>
Cellulose materials are blown-on and look like a shag rug on the surface. Cellulose materials are somewhat fragile, subject to surface damage and will be affected over time by condensation and humidity, leading to adhesion loss. World Trade Center report - Blaze key to collapse<br>
<br>
<br>
In other situations, two wallboard sections - Type X ( 5/8 inch thick - 14mm each ) are nailed together to provide fire protection. This is labour intensive and impractical in most major construction areas.<br>
<br>
Unlike most fire barriers requiring 2-3 inches thickness (50-70mm), OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ®FIRE&amp;reg (SP2001F) requires only 250-400 mils DFT ( 6 to 10 mm ) to provide fire protection. , OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® relies upon the dense combination of eight ceramic compounds to catch the heat of the flame. When flames contact the face of the coating, it begins a glazing or surface hardening that becomes tough while sealing off any pores to heat, smoke or gas passages. When the coating surface completely hardens, it forms a solid block against heat conduction. The OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® will set hard and hold constant for the duration of the fire. <br>
<br>
In summary OMEGA FIRE (SP 2001 F) ® is an extremely versatile high temperature insulation and fire protection coating that offers itself to uses across all industrial, commercial and residential boundaries. The fact that it is easy to apply, water based, nontoxic and remains flexible until used, makes this coating a promising choice for those with high temperature, insulation and fire protection needs.<br>

                            HOT PIPE COATING ® is a unique combination of high performance specialy designed high-temperature resins in a waterborne formula. This coating will dry slowly by evaporation and can be aided in the dry down by adding high heat to the environment. The product remains flexible when dried. HOT PIPE COATING ® was built to be used as the initial primer coating and high build coating applied over hot pipes or other high temperature surfaces to achieve immediate adhesion while calming down the hot surface. Using this coating as the primer and base coat, we can achieve adhesion over the hot surface and create a surface that is insulated to stop heat flow. It is waterborne to offer a nonflammable, non toxic formula for high heat situations. HOT PIPE COATING ® has proven to save better than 35% of fuel consumption insulating high temperature steam pipes with no risk of corrosion under insulation (CUI).  For temperature ranges up to 700°F \ 370°C as well as sub zero environments.<br>

HOT SURFACE COATING ® (HSC ®) is specifically engineered to control hot surface temperatures ranging between 65°C - 177 °C / 150 °F - 350°F. It is lightweight and smooth in appearance. This is a water-borne system using a special acrylic blend with specific ceramic compounds to provide the non-conductive block against heat transfer without depending upon reflectivity. The coating will dry down on a cold surface by evaporation and can be aided in the dry down by adding heat to the environment. If the surface is already heated, the dry-down process will take care of itself without additional steps required.<br>
<br>
HSC ® is water-borne to offer a non-flammable, non-toxic formula for medium heat surface applications over standard steam pipes, oven wall construction and other hot surfaces. This coating was designed for applications whose temperature exposures falls bellow that requires HOT PIPE COATING ® ( up to 700°F / 370°C). HSC ® is more easily applied for a smoother finish. <br>
<br>
HSC ® can be applied over metal, concrete, wood or all surfaces not glazed or containing polypropylene (having no pores). <br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION :<br>
SAFECOAT LATEX ® Fire Retardant Coating is a single component latex-based, intumescent fire retardant coating ideally suited for interior applications to SPF Plywood (Spruce/Pine/Fir), Oriented Strand Board (OSB), wood trusses and rough stud construction, where Flame Spread Ratings of 25 or less (&quot;Class A&quot; or Class 1) and low Smoke Developed Ratings are required. It limits flame spread by expanding to many times the original dry film thickness when exposed to heat. This expanded material forms a char which insulates the substrate against heat, and reduces available oxygen to the surface, thus limiting flame spread to a &quot;CLASS A&quot; rating on OSB, SPF plywood and Douglas Fir Decking as tested under ASTM E84-91a and CAN4-S102-M88 standards in a single coat application sprayed at 150 ft USG. SAFECOAT Latex dries quickly to a flat (matte) finish, having the appearance of conventional flat paint.<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS : <br>
imparts a Class A Flame Spread Rating to dimensional lumber, plywood and Oriented Strand Board (OSB).<br>
acts as a thermal barrier to protect foamed plastic insulation when used in conjunction with OSB.<br>
used in lieu of drywall on plywood and OSB for greater strength and resilience.<br>
replaces sprinklers in combustible concealed spaces, under NFPA-13.<br>
can be applied as a mandatory upgrade to assist owners and property managers to meet the latest fire and building code requirements. It may also be applied as a voluntary upgrade to lower fire risks and reduce insurance costs.<br>
<br>
FEATURES : <br>
is non-toxic. It contains no asbestos, harmful ingredients or solvents.<br>
is cost effective. A single coat applied at 150 ft&#39;/USG achieves a &quot;Class A&quot; Flame Spread Rating.<br>
is fire resistant. It will not burn in liquid or solid state. Under fire conditions, it forms a char, preventing the spread of flames, and slowing the penetration of heat through the substrate (Fire Endurance).<br>
has excellent adhesion and durability.<br>
may be tinted with a latex based &quot;Universal Tint&quot;.<br>
will adhere to metal and acts as a rust-inhibitor.<br>
is easy to apply - may be applied by brush, roller or spray.<br>

It is especially effective where exposure to moisture and UV radiation is a concern or coating is subject to repeated cleaning. It limits flame spread by expanding to many times the original dry film thickness when exposed to heat. This expanded material forms a char which insulates the substrate against heat, and reduces available oxygen to the surface, thus limiting flame spread to a &quot;CLASS A&quot;, on SPF plywood, as tested under CAN4-S102-M88 standards, in a single coat application sprayed at 150 sf \ USG.<br>
<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS : <br>
o imparts a Class A Flame Spread Rating to dimensional lumber and plywood which is subject to the elements or is subject to repeated cleaning or used in lieu of drywall on plywood and OSB for greater strength and resilience.<br>
o replace sprinklers in combustible concealed spaces, under NFPA-13.<br>
o can be applied as a mandatory upgrade to assist owners and property managers to meet the latest fire and building code requirements. It may also be applied as a voluntary upgrade to lower fire risks and reduce insurance costs.<br>
<br>
<br>
FEATURES : <br>
o is cost effective. A single coat applied at 150 ft USG achieves a &quot;Class A&quot; Flame Spread Rating.<br>
o is fire resistant. Under fire conditions, it forms a char, preventing the spread of flames, and slowing the penetration of heat through the substrate (Fire Endurance).<br>
o has excellent adhesion and durability.<br>
o may be tinted with a &quot;Universal Tint&quot;.<br>
o is easy to apply - may be applied by brush, roller or spray.<br>
o dries quickly to a flat (matte) finish, having the appearance of conventional flat paint.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION :<br>
SAFECOAT E-84 ® is a single component latex-based, intumescent fire retardant coating intended for interior use on polyurethane foam (for exterior applications use Safecoat Exterior). It dries to an opaque flat finish similar to a conventional flat latex. When exposed to the heat of a fire, SAFECOAT E-84 ® intumesces (swells up) to form a thick protective insulating barrier against heat and flames. It is tintable, non-toxic, washable, convenient, labor saving and environmentally friendly. SAFECOAT E-84 ® can be used to achieve a Class A Flame Spread Rating on many polyurethane foam substrates.<br>
<br>
<br>
APPLICATIONS: <br>
o Use to achieve a Class A flame spread rating and a low smoke developed rating, on high density polyurethane molded parts.<br>
o it may also be applied to polyurethane spray foam and most wood substrates.<br>
o when used in polyurethane mold applications, use of BARRIERCOAT 840 as a barrier and release agent ensures compatibility and improves flame resistance.<br>
o If the coated substrate will be subject to repeated washing or prolonged contact with moisture, a finishing coat of SAFECOAT 725 ® is recommended. Before applying any other finishing coat, consult the manufacturer or their representative.<br>
<br>
<br>
TEST RESULTS: <br>
Testing was conducted by independent polyurethane molding producers in accordance with ASTM E84-91a &quot;Standard Method of Test for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials and Assemblies&quot;. A coverage rate of approximately 80 sq/ft per USGallon is suggested to achieve a &quot;Class A&quot; rating.<br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Two identical ice arenas, pre-engineered stress skin metal buildings by Colony Buildings were built by a general contractor the Lark Group , at the same time. One in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Surrey, British Columbia. SUPERTHERM ® is the sole insulation applied to the exterior of the walls only as recommended by Lark Group, Project Manager Kirk Fisher.<br>
<br>
The Director of National Training Rinks, Dwayne Lowdermilk provided the following written comments with regards to the Surrey facility, &quot;Excellent Ice&quot;: <br>
<br>
&quot;We are in the business of operating ice facilities and we have found by using this product (Supertherm) we had a thirty percent saving on our energy costs which we sure appreciate.  It is my experience that I can safely say this product meets its rate sheets and allowed us to present a great finished product&quot;<br>
<br>
The general contractor, Kirk E. Fisher, P.Eng., MBA of the Lark Group provided the following statements in a letter:  <br>
<br>
&quot;Further to our discussion, this letter will confirm the occurrences in Kirkland, Quebec, at our existing twin sheet ice arena.  In October of 1998 we applied 7 dry mils of Super Therm insulation coating to the exterior of our stress skin metal building.  Everyone in Kirkland was skeptical that the product would insulate the building due to the harsh climate.  After two years of operations I was convinced to insulate the building to see if the hydro and gas costs would be reduced.  The building has now been in operation for a further two years and I can tell you the hydro and gas bill did not change at all.  The application of $30,000 of additional insulation did nothing.  This of course re-affirmed my faith in your product and I have decided to use it on our Surrey expansion and all other future ice arena devellopments.&quot;<br>
<br>
Note: The added insulation is closed cell foam applied to the interior surface of the building.<br>
