Many people have access to private long term disability benefits, often through group benefit plans offered by their employers. These benefits help to replace lost income when the insured person suffers a disability that prevents them from working.<br>

                            Owners and tenants of homes, businesses, government agencies and those exercising responsibility over practically every other place where people frequent are obliged to keep their premises safe for the public. This duty requires the occupier to ensure that the premises and the activities taking place on the premises do not pose a risk of harm to people frequenting these places.<br>
<br>
The duty protects victims of slip and fall injuries, injuries resulting from fires, injuries occurring at amusements parks and other commercial establishments.<br>
<br>
You may be entitled to claim compensation from the person responsible for the injury. This compensation is normally paid by the responsible persons insurer. In Ontario, slip and fall injury victims who suffer serious and permanent injuries can recover damages compensating them for all of their losses, including their pain and suffering, their past and future lost income, their extraordinary future health care and home maintenance costs, and their out of pocket expenses.<br>
<br>
Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation. These time limits can restrict your rights to recover your losses. Not everyone is entitled to claim compensation from the person who caused the accident. Each claim is different. Assessing the value of your claim and determining responsibility requires analysis by an experienced personal injury lawyer.<br>

<br>
The death of a loved one is an intensely painful and personal event. Coming to terms with such a loss is made more difficult when the death is unexpected and preventable.<br>
<br>
No amount of money can fill the void left by the loved one lost. However, family members will face real challenges paying for funeral expenses, grief counseling, replacing the deceaseds help caring for children, managing the household and paying bills with less income.<br>
<br>
Our system of law requires those responsible for the death to compensate family members for these and other losses. Family members are entitled to claim compensation from the person responsible for the death. This compensation is normally paid by the at-fault persons insurer.<br>
<br>
Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation. These time limits can restrict your rights to recover your losses. Not everyone is entitled to claim compensation from the person who caused the accident. Each claim is different.

In Ontario, motor vehicle collision victims and their family members can claim compensation for their losses from their own insurance company (No-Fault Accident Benefits) and from the person responsible for the collision (Tort Claim).<br>
<br>
Your insurer is obliged to pay No-Fault Accident Benefits compensating for lost income and paying for help performing household maintenance and self care activities. It must also pay for all necessary medical services and rehabilitation. The benefits are payable upon application. Time limits govern when you must apply. Laws determine which benefits are payable. Insurers often deny benefits they are obliged to pay. You are entitled to dispute the insurers refusal to pay your benefits. Different levels of benefits are available to injury victims, depending upon the type of injury and impairments.<br>
<br>
The process is complicated and requires analysis by an experienced personal injury lawyer.<br>

You may also be entitled to claim compensation from the person responsible for the collision. This compensation is normally paid by the at-fault persons insurer.

You may also be entitled to claim compensation from the person responsible for the collision. This compensation is normally paid by the responsible persons insurer. In Ontario, injury victims who suffer serious and permanent injuries can recover damages compensating them for their losses, including their pain and suffering, their past and future lost income, their extraordinary future health care and home maintenance costs, and their out of pocket expenses.<br>
<br>
Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation. These time limits can restrict your rights to recover your losses. Not everyone is entitled to claim compensation from the person who caused the accident. Each claim is different. Assessing the value of your claim and determining responsibility requires analysis by an experienced personal injury lawyer.<br>

The law holds owners responsible for injuries caused by their animals. These owners are liable to pay compensation for injuries and losses which the animal causes. Normally the owners homeowner or tenant insurance policy will pay the compensation. Animal owners are responsible for injuries caused by vicious animals who attack and for injuries caused by their failure to keep their livestock properly contained.<br>
<br>
In Ontario, animal attack victims who suffer serious and permanent injuries can recover damages compensating them for all of their losses, including their pain and suffering, their past and future lost income, their extraordinary future health care and home maintenance costs, and their out of pocket expenses.<br>

Many people have access to private long term disability benefits, often through group benefit plans offered by their employers. These benefits help to replace lost income when the insured person suffers a disability that prevents them from working.<br>

                            Owners and tenants of homes, businesses, government agencies and those exercising responsibility over practically every other place where people frequent are obliged to keep their premises safe for the public. This duty requires the occupier to ensure that the premises and the activities taking place on the premises do not pose a risk of harm to people frequenting these places.<br>
<br>
The duty protects victims of slip and fall injuries, injuries resulting from fires, injuries occurring at amusements parks and other commercial establishments.<br>
<br>
You may be entitled to claim compensation from the person responsible for the injury. This compensation is normally paid by the responsible persons insurer. In Ontario, slip and fall injury victims who suffer serious and permanent injuries can recover damages compensating them for all of their losses, including their pain and suffering, their past and future lost income, their extraordinary future health care and home maintenance costs, and their out of pocket expenses.<br>
<br>
Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation. These time limits can restrict your rights to recover your losses. Not everyone is entitled to claim compensation from the person who caused the accident. Each claim is different. Assessing the value of your claim and determining responsibility requires analysis by an experienced personal injury lawyer.<br>
<br>
Our team has helped injury victims recover compensation from negligent property owners, department stores, amusement parks, hotel operators, building inspectors and government bodies responsible for keeping properties safe. <br>

<br>
The death of a loved one is an intensely painful and personal event. Coming to terms with such a loss is made more difficult when the death is unexpected and preventable.<br>
<br>
No amount of money can fill the void left by the loved one lost. However, family members will face real challenges paying for funeral expenses, grief counseling, replacing the deceaseds help caring for children, managing the household and paying bills with less income.<br>
<br>
Our system of law requires those responsible for the death to compensate family members for these and other losses. Family members are entitled to claim compensation from the person responsible for the death. This compensation is normally paid by the at-fault persons insurer.<br>
<br>
Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation.

<br>
In Ontario, motor vehicle collision victims and their family members can claim compensation for their losses from their own insurance company (No-Fault Accident Benefits) and from the person responsible for the collision (Tort Claim).<br>
<br>
Your insurer is obliged to pay No-Fault Accident Benefits compensating for lost income and paying for help performing household maintenance and self care activities. It must also pay for all necessary medical services and rehabilitation. The benefits are payable upon application. Time limits govern when you must apply. Laws determine which benefits are payable. Insurers often deny benefits they are obliged to pay. You are entitled to dispute the insurers refusal to pay your benefits. Different levels of benefits are available to injury victims, depending upon the type of injury and impairments.<br>
<br>
The process is complicated and requires analysis by an experienced personal injury lawyer.<br>
<br>
You may also be entitled to claim compensation from the person responsible for the collision. This compensation is normally paid by the at-fault persons insurer. In Ontario, injury victims who suffer serious and permanent injuries can recover damages compensating them for all of their losses, including their pain and suffering, their past and future lost income, their extraordinary future health care and home maintenance costs, and their out of pocket expenses.<br>
<br>
Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation. These time limits can restrict your rights to recover your losses. Not everyone is entitled to claim compensation from the person who caused the accident. Each claim is different. Assessing the value of your claim and determining responsibility requires analysis by an experienced Toronto personal injury lawyer.<br>

The law holds owners responsible for injuries caused by their animals. These owners are liable to pay compensation for injuries and losses which the animal causes. Normally the owners homeowner or tenant insurance policy will pay the compensation. Animal owners are responsible for injuries caused by vicious animals who attack and for injuries caused by their failure to keep their livestock properly contained.<br>
<br>
In Ontario, animal attack victims who suffer serious and permanent injuries can recover damages compensating them for all of their losses, including their pain and suffering, their past and future lost income, their extraordinary future health care and home maintenance costs, and their out of pocket expenses.<br>

Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation. These time limits can restrict your rights to recover your losses. Not everyone is entitled to claim compensation from the person who caused the accident. Each claim is different. Assessing your animal attack injury, identifying those responsible and determining the value of your claim requires analysis by an experienced personal injury lawyer. <br>

                            Injuries Resulting from Unsafe Products<br>
<br>
We all depend on the safety of the products we use each day. We are entitled to expect that all things we use, including the cars we drive, the clothes we wear and the food we eat, are designed, tested, manufactured, produced and distributed in a way that protects us from harm.<br>
<br>
Sometimes things go wrong. In Ontario, the law protects us from dangerous products. Consumers who suffer injury caused by a dangerous product can claim compensation from those responsible.<br>
<br>
In Ontario, dangerous product injury victims who suffer serious and permanent injuries can recover damages compensating them for all of their losses, including their pain and suffering, their past and future lost income, their extraordinary future health care and home maintenance costs, and their out of pocket expenses.<br>
<br>
Time limits govern when you must notify the responsible parties that you intend to bring a claim and they govern when you must start your claim for compensation. These time limits can restrict your rights to recover your losses. Not everyone is entitled to claim compensation from the person who caused the accident. Each claim is different. Determining whether a product is unsafe, assessing whether it caused your injury, identifying those responsible and assessing the value of your claim requires analysis by an experienced personal injury lawyer. <br>
