                            There are a multitude of issues facing the healthcare system. With the escalating costs of treating chronically ill patients, the discovery and use of ground breaking but very expensive medications and the economic pressures created by a shrinking tax base and aging population our system appears to be near a point where it will be difficult to support.  At Sykes Assistance Services we have tried to help by taking some of this pressure off. With solutions designed to manage demand for services by helping people to make informed decisions about where to go and how to cope we have played a small but significant supporting role in building the foundation for a sustainable healthcare system. <br>
<br>
Sykes Assistance Services has offered Symptom Assessment and Referral also known as telephone triage to both the private and public sectors since 1997. With 6 telehealth centres and over 300 registered nurses on staff the service is available 24 / 7 through many different electronic channels or by simply dialling 8-1-1 depending on the jurisdiction.  <br>
 <br>
The goal of the program is to help people become more confident in their ability to care for themselves and their loved ones.  Most people when provided with good information and advice will choose a less acute setting in which to be seen. Other documented benefits of the service include the support of large populations where access is an issue or during times of great need as was the case during the H1N1 pandemic. By providing the capacity and scalability of a virtual contact centre we are able to meet highly variable demand across large geographic areas at any time of the day or night and do this in the language of the callers choice, something that the traditional site based healthcare system is just not equipped to do.<br>
<br>
In fact over 40% of the people who use our tele-triage services are provided information on how to take care of themselves at home with less than 20% typically guided to seek more urgent care at a hospital.<br>
<br>
Our service provides access to healthcare professionals and support staff that are available to respond to issues ranging from simple questions about where to find certain resources to complex symptoms that may be signs of significant underlying health problems. Our clinical team has access to evidence-informed electronic decision support with embedded clinical guidelines and health information databases covering a wide variety of healthcare issues.<br>
<br>
We provide just in time information and advice over many different channels such as a customer branded self-serve web portal, targeted individualized e-learning programs, text messages, email and regular post.  <br>

                            Having a chronic condition like Type II  Diabetes, Heart Failure, C.O.P.D.  and Asthma is a full time job that impacts people in large cities and small rural communities alike. At Sykes Assistance Services we believe that since people are always dealing with their health problems then we should always be available to help. That is why we have created a 24/7 service designed to be there when we are needed most. <br>
<br>
By supporting patients and their formal and informal care networks we can help people access care regardless of when they need it or where they live.<br>
<br>
Using Telehealth to Support Primary Care<br>
Our model of disease prevention and self-management is based on the philosophy that telehealth will work best when it acts as a natural extension of the relationship between an individual and their family practice - what the Chronic Care Model refers to as the relationship between an informed activated patient and a prepared proactive provider team.<br>
<br>
Our telehealth solutions can help convert episodic care processes into a care management program where the reach of primary care is extended both in terms of the time it is available and place where it is delivered. We can provide evidence-based outreach, support decision making and counsel for behaviour change all the while supporting the existing relationship between a patient and their primary care team.<br>
<br>
Our Programs are designed to:<br>
	Make primary care available 24 hours a day and seven days a week<br>
	Identify people at risk for exacerbations, and increased utilization of healthcare resources<br>
	Support patient and family centred interventions<br>
	Increase patient engagement in and ownership of their care plans<br>
	Improve clinic work flow, virtually eliminating no shows, improving follow up and preventing unnecessary visits to the emergency department and unplanned admissions to hospital<br>
	Improve the efficiency of clinical practice thereby improving economic outcomes for providers<br>
<br>
What We Do<br>
<br>
Respond<br>
The foundation of the Sykes Assistance Services primary care support program is our 24 hours a day, 7 days a week telehealth service.  By closely integrating our virtual care team with a primary care practice we can provide care and coping support for patients and their families.  Our care team will provide patient centred assessment, advice and system navigation using evidence-based guidelines and patient centred care plans that have been developed by the local team. Through secure integration we can also support advanced access and other innovative practice solutions. Finally by accessing and supporting a patients discharge plan we can help prevent unplanned readmissions.<br>
<br>
Assess<br>
By integrating to the patients EMR our team can help identify patients that meet guideline - based requirements for enhanced care.  We will then further stratify the patients to identify variables such as multi-morbidity, activation levels, and social determinants based challenges to care (e.g. poverty, literacy, housing, and transportation).Then working with the Provider team we will create interventions designed to optimize the patients care experience.<br>
<br>
Monitor<br>
Using clinical guidelines and individual practice processes we will identify and support the monitoring of targeted patients.   This monitoring process can include mobile devices, tele-homecare solutions or simple text messaging or phone systems to capture key indicators such as medication adherence, weight, blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation as well as to detect falls or other issues regarding activities of daily living. Sykes Assistance Services can provide monitoring and support 24 hours a day using a highly scalable and therefore cost effective solution. Our monitoring is a turnkey solution with our team managing the implementation and support of all devices used.<br>
<br>
Navigate<br>
Our navigation service is designed to improve patient flow and access to services within the clinic, after discharge from hospital and to those provided by the government and other agencies.  The core solutions involved in navigation are inbound call handling, automated reminders, follow up and community service referral. <br>
<br>
Inbound call handling<br>
The Sykes Assistance Services team can support a busy clinics switch board either after hours or during peak times. With appropriate access we can help create appointments or provide clinical after hours support using registered nurses ensuring that all patients that contact the clinic are provided with appropriate referral and care that is inside of the provider network. This is designed with continuity of care in mind. <br>
<br>
Automated reminders and follow up<br>
The automated communication systems provides secure voice and digital communication to help remind patients about appointments or routine follow up as well as providing a cost effective way to assess progress, capture vital signs, coach for behaviour change, provide patient education, and measure patient satisfaction. The communication is delivered without human intervention beyond routine use of the clinic scheduling system or initiation of patient centric care plans. Communication can be in the form of interactive voice response (IVR), text message, email or regular post. Users have access to evidence-based content through a secure connection to the Sykes Assistance Services on-line environment.<br>
<br>
Service referral<br>
Sykes Assistance Services maintains a service referral database so that callers and on-line users can access information on community services that are within the healthcare system as well as those programs that impact the social determents of health. (e.g. disease specific associations, housing, early childhood development, social assistance)<br>
<br>
Coach<br>
The Sykes Assistance Services CareCoach® program helps provider teams to reach out to patients and their families in between visits. This behaviour support program is an adjunct to counselling provided by in office staff.  Our CareCoaches follow evidence-based guidelines and provider developed care plans to enhance patient self-management. Using brief interventions and on line tools they employ motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural counselling techniques to help people reach treatment goals.  Our CareCoaches also have access to a network of allied health professionals that can augment existing local resources as required.  All encounters are documented and shared with the patients provider team to optimize collaboration and continuity of care. Our CareCoach program employs a primary coach philosophy so that people get to know their coaches thereby enhancing outcomes. <br>

                            Giving up tobacco is one of the smartest and most valuable decisions anyone can make. Smoking and the use of tobacco products in general are major contributing factors to lung disease and several cancers, plus a host of other serious health issues that can affect and even end an individual&#39;s life. But quitting is much easier said than done. Most people have to make several attempts at quitting before they finally succeed, partly because they dont have the resources and professional advice they need to break the habit. <br>
<br>
Tobacco-related illnesses put tremendous pressure on our health care system. Hospital visits, diagnoses, and treatments for these diseases demand time and resources that cost taxpayers millions of dollars every year. Reducing smoking means lowering that tax burden and directing health care resources to other important areas.<br>
<br>
Our CareCoach® Tobacco Cessation program is available to governments at all levels as a means of limiting the impact of smoking and its associated costs across the country. We take a person-centred approach, guiding each individual step-by-step through the quitting process to ensure the highest chance of success. Along with our CareCoach® Cessation Counsellors, we also employ registered nurses and other licensed medical professionals, and use up-to-date evidence-based resources. CareCoach® offers a tobacco cessation program available 24 / 7 via a toll-free telephone number, a tobacco cessation web site, social media based online communities, text messaging, chat and automated voice channels.  This service, staffed by trained cessation counsellors, provides confidential multichannel cessation counselling for those who want to stop using tobacco.<br>
<br>
Sykes CareCoaches® provide enhanced support and assistance to eligible individuals who want to quit smoking using evidence-based protocols and the concepts of readiness, motivation and self-efficacy.   Using the spirit of motivational interviewing counsellors provide information and advice about smoking cessation, support materials (brochures and electronic media) and referrals to other programs as required. In addition, Sykes CareCoaches® answer panic calls from an individual, their spouse or dependent where the caller is in the midst of their quit plan and is tempted to relapse.  Our counsellors provide additional support and guidance to enable the caller to stay on track with their plan.<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, many people don&#39;t know what to do when they have a problem or emergency at home especially when it occurs at night or on the weekend. These issues are compounded even more if you are a senior living in your own home and you do not have easy access to friends or family to help you out.  A flooded basement, damaged driveway, or leaky roof can mean an expensive repair.  Who can you trust when your most valuable asset needs professional help?<br>

That&#39;s why our Home Assistance Services program is designed to give clear advice, offer instruction in difficult situations, and provide access to reliable service people when something goes wrong - all part of a better customer experience.  <br>

                            When policyholders contact you, you have one call to make. The Sykes Accident Towing Program.<br>
<br>
In Ontario alone, Auto insurance fraud ranges between $770 million and $1.6 billion per year. People that have been called Chasers usually take control over what occurs at the scene of an accident because they can get there first; offering services not related to towing such as referrals to disreputable body shops, health care and legal services. Policyholders, when involved in an accident, do not know their rights or what to do in the face of the chasers and police instructions following an accident.<br>
<br>
We have  a unique, superior offering to assist insurance companies to help prevent, detect and manage fraud in addition to providing accident towing.<br>
<br>
Sykes Assistance Services will work in partnership with all auto insurance industry key players and leverage its extensive network of towing operators, health care network and customer service representatives to support the business needs of insurance companies and be proactive about fraud prevention activities and management.<br>
<br>
By calling a dedicated toll-free number to their insurance company or Sykes Assistance Services , from the scene of the accident or at the CRC, our affiliated towing operators will be dispatched immediately to ensure the vehicle recovery and movement is completed hassle-free and in accordance with the insurance providers protocol.<br>

                            Working closely with our customers we have created a primary care support program that has allowed over 8,000 primary care providers to offer 24 / 7 primary care access.<br>
<br>
By directly integrating our service with primary care clinics, Sykes can reduce the burden on physicians and provide appropriate access to patients after regular clinic hours.  This service has provided crucial health information and advice to callers while supporting the physician&#39;s desire to have their patients seen by the right care provider at the right time and location.  One of the key benefits of our integrated approach is to ensure that if at all possible patients are seen by their family physician in their clinic during regular office hours. By helping people cope with emerging symptoms we are able to support their decisions to either stay home and take care of themselves or to wait and see a member of their primary care team. However, if symptoms and the patient`s situation warrants a more acute approach we will help them get to the care they need.<br>
<br>
Improving Patient Flow<br>
Patients that miss appointments (i.e. no shows) or that are unprepared for appointments when they arrive can cause significant disruption for a practice.  In addition patients who need periodic check-ups but who forget to book these visits can cause harm to themselves and more work for the team. Through the use of automated appointment reminders and pre-appointment information Sykes Assistance Services can significantly improve the efficiency of a practice.  Also by identifying and then reaching out to targeted chronically ill patients we can ensure that people obtain the on-going care they need.<br>
<br>
Coaching<br>
By implementing our CareCoach® program Sykes Assistance Services will extend the reach of the primary care team so that patients can be supported in between visits.  Using evidence-based approaches including motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural counselling we help providers deliver self-management support to their patients and informal care providers.  Our coaches are available to reach out to patients as part of a scheduled care management program or to speak to patients on an inbound unscheduled basis to help with navigation and issues they may be having with motivation. Our CareCoaches can provide access to a myriad of health information solutions including, disease specific self-management advice, preference based decision support, IVR and text message reminders, and self-paced e-learning tools.<br>
<br>
We can help:<br>
	Provide 24/7 access to symptom assessment, referrals and appointment scheduling- keeping patients in your network<br>
	Support prepared activated patients that show up on time for appointments<br>
	Coach for lifestyle change and maintenance (tobacco cessation, weight loss and activation through exercise)<br>
	Complex patients and their families navigate an ever more complex system<br>
	Deescalate problems for patients that have complex psychosocial needs<br>

                            There are a multitude of issues facing the healthcare system. With the escalating costs of treating chronically ill patients, the discovery and use of ground breaking but very expensive medications and the economic pressures created by a shrinking tax base and aging population our system appears to be near a point where it will be difficult to support.  At Sykes Assistance Services we have tried to help by taking some of this pressure off. With solutions designed to manage demand for services by helping people to make informed decisions about where to go and how to cope we have played a small but significant supporting role in building the foundation for a sustainable healthcare system. <br>
<br>
Sykes Assistance Services has offered Symptom Assessment and Referral also known as telephone triage to both the private and public sectors since 1997. With 6 telehealth centres and over 300 registered nurses on staff the service is available 24 / 7 through many different electronic channels or by simply dialling 8-1-1 depending on the jurisdiction.  <br>
 <br>
The goal of the program is to help people become more confident in their ability to care for themselves and their loved ones.  Most people when provided with good information and advice will choose a less acute setting in which to be seen. Other documented benefits of the service include the support of large populations where access is an issue or during times of great need as was the case during the H1N1 pandemic. By providing the capacity and scalability of a virtual contact centre we are able to meet highly variable demand across large geographic areas at any time of the day or night and do this in the language of the callers choice, something that the traditional site based healthcare system is just not equipped to do.<br>
<br>
In fact over 40% of the people who use our tele-triage services are provided information on how to take care of themselves at home with less than 20% typically guided to seek more urgent care at a hospital.<br>
<br>
Our service provides access to healthcare professionals and support staff that are available to respond to issues ranging from simple questions about where to find certain resources to complex symptoms that may be signs of significant underlying health problems. Our clinical team has access to evidence-informed electronic decision support with embedded clinical guidelines and health information databases covering a wide variety of healthcare issues.<br>
<br>
We provide just in time information and advice over many different channels such as a customer branded self-serve web portal, targeted individualized e-learning programs, text messages, email and regular post.  <br>

                            Having a chronic condition like Type II  Diabetes, Heart Failure, C.O.P.D.  and Asthma is a full time job that impacts people in large cities and small rural communities alike. At Sykes Assistance Services we believe that since people are always dealing with their health problems then we should always be available to help. That is why we have created a 24/7 service designed to be there when we are needed most. <br>
<br>
By supporting patients and their formal and informal care networks we can help people access care regardless of when they need it or where they live.<br>
<br>
Using Telehealth to Support Primary Care<br>
Our model of disease prevention and self-management is based on the philosophy that telehealth will work best when it acts as a natural extension of the relationship between an individual and their family practice - what the Chronic Care Model refers to as the relationship between an informed activated patient and a prepared proactive provider team.<br>
<br>
Our telehealth solutions can help convert episodic care processes into a care management program where the reach of primary care is extended both in terms of the time it is available and place where it is delivered. We can provide evidence-based outreach, support decision making and counsel for behaviour change all the while supporting the existing relationship between a patient and their primary care team.<br>
<br>
Our Programs are designed to:<br>
	Make primary care available 24 hours a day and seven days a week<br>
	Identify people at risk for exacerbations, and increased utilization of healthcare resources<br>
	Support patient and family centred interventions<br>
	Increase patient engagement in and ownership of their care plans<br>
	Improve clinic work flow, virtually eliminating no shows, improving follow up and preventing unnecessary visits to the emergency department and unplanned admissions to hospital<br>
	Improve the efficiency of clinical practice thereby improving economic outcomes for providers<br>
<br>
What We Do<br>
<br>
Respond<br>
The foundation of the Sykes Assistance Services primary care support program is our 24 hours a day, 7 days a week telehealth service.  By closely integrating our virtual care team with a primary care practice we can provide care and coping support for patients and their families.  Our care team will provide patient centred assessment, advice and system navigation using evidence-based guidelines and patient centred care plans that have been developed by the local team. Through secure integration we can also support advanced access and other innovative practice solutions. Finally by accessing and supporting a patients discharge plan we can help prevent unplanned readmissions.<br>
<br>
Assess<br>
By integrating to the patients EMR our team can help identify patients that meet guideline - based requirements for enhanced care.  We will then further stratify the patients to identify variables such as multi-morbidity, activation levels, and social determinants based challenges to care (e.g. poverty, literacy, housing, and transportation).Then working with the Provider team we will create interventions designed to optimize the patients care experience.<br>
<br>
Monitor<br>
Using clinical guidelines and individual practice processes we will identify and support the monitoring of targeted patients.   This monitoring process can include mobile devices, tele-homecare solutions or simple text messaging or phone systems to capture key indicators such as medication adherence, weight, blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation as well as to detect falls or other issues regarding activities of daily living. Sykes Assistance Services can provide monitoring and support 24 hours a day using a highly scalable and therefore cost effective solution. Our monitoring is a turnkey solution with our team managing the implementation and support of all devices used.<br>
<br>
Navigate<br>
Our navigation service is designed to improve patient flow and access to services within the clinic, after discharge from hospital and to those provided by the government and other agencies.  The core solutions involved in navigation are inbound call handling, automated reminders, follow up and community service referral. <br>
<br>
Inbound call handling<br>
The Sykes Assistance Services team can support a busy clinics switch board either after hours or during peak times. With appropriate access we can help create appointments or provide clinical after hours support using registered nurses ensuring that all patients that contact the clinic are provided with appropriate referral and care that is inside of the provider network. This is designed with continuity of care in mind. <br>
<br>
Automated reminders and follow up<br>
The automated communication systems provides secure voice and digital communication to help remind patients about appointments or routine follow up as well as providing a cost effective way to assess progress, capture vital signs, coach for behaviour change, provide patient education, and measure patient satisfaction. The communication is delivered without human intervention beyond routine use of the clinic scheduling system or initiation of patient centric care plans. Communication can be in the form of interactive voice response (IVR), text message, email or regular post. Users have access to evidence-based content through a secure connection to the Sykes Assistance Services on-line environment.<br>
<br>
Service referral<br>
Sykes Assistance Services maintains a service referral database so that callers and on-line users can access information on community services that are within the healthcare system as well as those programs that impact the social determents of health. (e.g. disease specific associations, housing, early childhood development, social assistance)<br>
<br>
Coach<br>
The Sykes Assistance Services CareCoach® program helps provider teams to reach out to patients and their families in between visits. This behaviour support program is an adjunct to counselling provided by in office staff.  Our CareCoaches follow evidence-based guidelines and provider developed care plans to enhance patient self-management. Using brief interventions and on line tools they employ motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural counselling techniques to help people reach treatment goals.  Our CareCoaches also have access to a network of allied health professionals that can augment existing local resources as required.  All encounters are documented and shared with the patients provider team to optimize collaboration and continuity of care. Our CareCoach program employs a primary coach philosophy so that people get to know their coaches thereby enhancing outcomes. <br>

                            Giving up tobacco is one of the smartest and most valuable decisions anyone can make. Smoking and the use of tobacco products in general are major contributing factors to lung disease and several cancers, plus a host of other serious health issues that can affect and even end an individual&#39;s life. But quitting is much easier said than done. Most people have to make several attempts at quitting before they finally succeed, partly because they dont have the resources and professional advice they need to break the habit. <br>
<br>
Tobacco-related illnesses put tremendous pressure on our health care system. Hospital visits, diagnoses, and treatments for these diseases demand time and resources that cost taxpayers millions of dollars every year. Reducing smoking means lowering that tax burden and directing health care resources to other important areas.<br>
<br>
Our CareCoach® Tobacco Cessation program is available to governments at all levels as a means of limiting the impact of smoking and its associated costs across the country. We take a person-centred approach, guiding each individual step-by-step through the quitting process to ensure the highest chance of success. Along with our CareCoach® Cessation Counsellors, we also employ registered nurses and other licensed medical professionals, and use up-to-date evidence-based resources. CareCoach® offers a tobacco cessation program available 24 / 7 via a toll-free telephone number, a tobacco cessation web site, social media based online communities, text messaging, chat and automated voice channels.  This service, staffed by trained cessation counsellors, provides confidential multichannel cessation counselling for those who want to stop using tobacco.<br>
<br>
Sykes CareCoaches® provide enhanced support and assistance to eligible individuals who want to quit smoking using evidence-based protocols and the concepts of readiness, motivation and self-efficacy.   Using the spirit of motivational interviewing counsellors provide information and advice about smoking cessation, support materials (brochures and electronic media) and referrals to other programs as required. In addition, Sykes CareCoaches® answer panic calls from an individual, their spouse or dependent where the caller is in the midst of their quit plan and is tempted to relapse.  Our counsellors provide additional support and guidance to enable the caller to stay on track with their plan.<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, many people don&#39;t know what to do when they have a problem or emergency at home especially when it occurs at night or on the weekend.

                            When policyholders contact you, you have one call to make. The Sykes Accident Towing Program.<br>
<br>
In Ontario alone, Auto insurance fraud ranges between $770 million and $1.6 billion per year. People that have been called Chasers usually take control over what occurs at the scene of an accident because they can get there first; offering services not related to towing such as referrals to disreputable body shops, health care and legal services. Policyholders, when involved in an accident, do not know their rights or what to do in the face of the chasers and police instructions following an accident.<br>
<br>
We have  a unique, superior offering to assist insurance companies to help prevent, detect and manage fraud in addition to providing accident towing.<br>
<br>
Sykes Assistance Services will work in partnership with all auto insurance industry key players and leverage its extensive network of towing operators, health care network and customer service representatives to support the business needs of insurance companies and be proactive about fraud prevention activities and management.<br>
<br>
By calling a dedicated toll-free number to their insurance company or Sykes Assistance Services , from the scene of the accident or at the CRC, our affiliated towing operators will be dispatched immediately to ensure the vehicle recovery and movement is completed hassle-free and in accordance with the insurance providers protocol.<br>

                            Working closely with our customers we have created a primary care support program that has allowed over 8,000 primary care providers to offer 24 / 7 primary care access.<br>
<br>
By directly integrating our service with primary care clinics, Sykes can reduce the burden on physicians and provide appropriate access to patients after regular clinic hours.  This service has provided crucial health information and advice to callers while supporting the physician&#39;s desire to have their patients seen by the right care provider at the right time and location.  One of the key benefits of our integrated approach is to ensure that if at all possible patients are seen by their family physician in their clinic during regular office hours. By helping people cope with emerging symptoms we are able to support their decisions to either stay home and take care of themselves or to wait and see a member of their primary care team. However, if symptoms and the patient`s situation warrants a more acute approach we will help them get to the care they need.<br>
<br>
Improving Patient Flow<br>
Patients that miss appointments (i.e. no shows) or that are unprepared for appointments when they arrive can cause significant disruption for a practice.  In addition patients who need periodic check-ups but who forget to book these visits can cause harm to themselves and more work for the team. Through the use of automated appointment reminders and pre-appointment information Sykes Assistance Services can significantly improve the efficiency of a practice.  Also by identifying and then reaching out to targeted chronically ill patients we can ensure that people obtain the on-going care they need.<br>
<br>
Coaching<br>
By implementing our CareCoach® program Sykes Assistance Services will extend the reach of the primary care team so that patients can be supported in between visits.  Using evidence-based approaches including motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural counselling we help providers deliver self-management support to their patients and informal care providers.  Our coaches are available to reach out to patients as part of a scheduled care management program or to speak to patients on an inbound unscheduled basis to help with navigation and issues they may be having with motivation. Our CareCoaches can provide access to a myriad of health information solutions including, disease specific self-management advice, preference based decision support, IVR and text message reminders, and self-paced e-learning tools.<br>
<br>
We can help:<br>
	Provide 24/7 access to symptom assessment, referrals and appointment scheduling- keeping patients in your network<br>
	Support prepared activated patients that show up on time for appointments<br>
	Coach for lifestyle change and maintenance (tobacco cessation, weight loss and activation through exercise)<br>
	Complex patients and their families navigate an ever more complex system<br>
	Deescalate problems for patients that have complex psychosocial needs<br>
