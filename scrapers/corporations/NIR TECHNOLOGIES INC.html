        <br>            About NIR Technologies Inc.<br><br>NIR Technologies Inc. was established to develop new applications and deliver services in the new and emerging field of near infrared spectroscopy. Near infrared, which is referred to by some as the sleeping giant of analytical chemistry, has found applications in many industries including pharmaceutical, petrochemical, polymer/plastic, agricultural, food, and  medical industries for both quality control and research.<br><br>NIR Technologies Inc. was founded by Dr. Hormoz Azizian, who has a Ph.D. in Organometallic Chemistry from Sussex University, U.K. He has previously worked at both the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo, and as a project leader at one of the top electric power producers in North America. He was technically responsible for:<br><br>- The Development and implementation of the FT-NIR cable insulation identification technology to non-destrucctively identify cable insulation on site in nuclear stations <br><br>- The design, development, construction and marketing of a portable moisture and saturation analyzer that is used at-line to determine the relative saturation and moisture content of insulating oils in electrical equipment <br><br>- The joint development of a polymer modification process at the University of Waterloo which was patented worldwide and received the gold award for innovation from the Government of Canada in 1987. The process was successfully commercialized <br><br>His recent FT-NIR developments include:<br><br>The development of a non-invasive human fat content measurement in less than a minute (Canadian Patent No. 2,404,891-Issued 2003/11/18) and subsequesntly patetneted in USA and European countries. It has now been applied to measure body fat content during pregnancy with some valueable information during the three trimesters. See our website www.nirhealth.ca<br><br>The quantitative analysis of Fatty acid content of fats and oils using Fourier Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy Patented in USA, Canada, and Australia.  This methodology has now been expanded in the detection of and determination of adulteranteration in extra virgin olive oil (Patent pending). <br><br>How can NIR Technologies Inc. be of assistance to you? <br> <br>Preview our website www.nirtechnologies.com regarding Quality Assurance &amp; Quality Control, Research &amp; Development, Technical Consulting and/or contact us directly.<br><br> NIR Technologies Inc. is in a unique position with its extensive <br>chemical research and development and spectroscopy background to assist you in developing NIR applications and help you in the <br>implementation of the near infrared technology in your plant.  <br><br><br><br><br>

                            The new Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (Nutrition Labelling, Nutrient Content Claims and Health Claims) for oils/fats and food products came into effect on December 12, 2002 and it stipulates that companies must now include fatty acid composition, particularly trans fatty acids on product labels by December 2005. The final ruling by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for labelling trans fatty acids content of food products was published on July 11, 2003 with an effective date of January 1, 2006. <br>
<br>
An analytical technique is now available, using Fourier Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy, that combines the speed of Fourier Transform Infrared (an official AOCS method Cd 14d-99) and specificity &amp; accuracy of Gas Chromatography (an official AOCS method Ce 1f-96) to give full fatty acid profiling of edible oils. Using this technique, NIR Technologies has developed patent pending (US Patent Application No. 10/840277) calibration models, in conjunction with Bruker optics FT-NIR instruments, to determine the Fatty Acid concentrations in edible oils in about a minute.<br>

                            What is NIR? Near Infrared spectroscopy is a non-destructive, <br>
fast accurate, and portable technology.  In simple, terms, a near <br>
infrared laser light is pointed at a sample using a fibre optic <br>
probe and the reflected signal is processed for absorption or <br>
reflectance characteristics.  In other words, we take a chemical <br>
fingerprint of a material using infrared light at a specific <br>
point in time. A complete scanning process is done in a few <br>
seconds. <br>
<br>
Once an absorption spectrum of a non-metallic material is <br>
obtained and stored electronically, it can be used as a reference <br>
for chemical fingerprinting of materials. The NIR Technology can <br>
be used to enhance quality assurance and in quality control.  It <br>
can also be used in research and development.  Near Infrared <br>
Spectroscopy which is referred to by some as the sleeping giant <br>
of analytical chemistry, has found applications in many <br>
industries including pharmaceutical, petrochemical, polymer <br>
plastic, agricultural, food, and medical industries for both <br>
quality control and research and development.<br>

                            Are Quality Assurance and Quality Control functions important to <br>
your business?  Have you ever wondered if you could cut your <br>
quality control costs? Have you ever wished to have the <br>
opportunity to compete on a level playing field with large <br>
multinational corporations in the area of quality control?<br>
<br>
WE CAN SHOW YOU HOW.<br>
<br>
NIR Technologies Inc. was established to assist you in realizing <br>
those advantages.  We are equipped with Fourier Transform Near <br>
Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIR) which is a comparative method that <br>
can be used as a quality control tool or in receipt-inspection to <br>
fingerprint (chemical composition) non-metallic materials both <br>
liquids and solids.  Once a spectrum of a sample is obtained it <br>
can be used as a reference for future comparison purposes.  It <br>
can be used in raw material inspection, on-line during <br>
processing, or QC of finished products.<br>

<br>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980. In 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight. Of these over 200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese. 65% of the world&#39;s population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight. More than 40 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide. <br>
<br>
<br>
FT-NIR Spectroscopy is the latest technology used as a simple, fast, reliable, non-invasive, cost-effective and accurate method to measure body fat content. While there are many techniques used to measure body fat, FT-NIR Spectroscopy has proven to be comparable to very accurate methods, such as, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). <br>
<br>
<br>
This technique is fast, accurate, reliable, non-invasive and cost-effective. <br>

                            NIR Technologies Inc. currently holds a Drug Establishment Licence (# 101313-A) issued by Health Canada for the identification of packaging materials.<br>
<br>
Fourier Transform Near Infrared spectroscopy has established itself as a fast, accurate, reliable, cost effective and  non-destructive measurement method for the identification of materials and Quality Control and Quality Assurance. For example, for one of our pharmaceutical customers, we have developed and implemented an identification method for the packaging components. As a result, the waiting period for analysis was reduced from ten days, with the previous technique, to same day service. <br>
 <br>
We can provide the same day service once we have included your packaging material in our identification library.<br>
<br>
Contact us if you are interested to speed up your production runs and need the same day analysis of the packaging material.<br>

            What is NIR?  Near Infrared Spectroscopy.<br>
<br>
-  In simple terms, a near infrared laser light is pointed at a sample using fibre optic probe and the reflected signal is processed for absorption or reflectance characteristics.  In other word, we take a <br>
chemical fingerprint of a material using infrared light at a <br>
specific point in time.<br>
<br>
- In spectroscopic terms, NIR means the measurement of the <br>
wavelength and intensities of the absorption of near infrared <br>
light by a sample.  The absorption or reflectance spectrum is <br>
directly proportional to the chemical composition of the sample.<br>
<br>
- In economical terms, near infrared means fast, accurate, <br>
reliable, cost-effective and non-destructive measurement for <br>
identification of materials and quality control.<br>
<br>
Near Infrared Spectroscopy has established itself as a non-destructive tool for identification of cable insulation in nuclear power plants.  NIR Technologies Inc.&#39;s founder  was responsible <br>
for the development and implementation of this technology at one of the top electric power producers in North America.  <br>
<br>
NIR Technologies Inc.  provided this services to RCM Technologies at Bruce power in the restart of units 3 &amp; 4 and continues to do the same in  the restart of  units 1 &amp; 2.<br>
<br>
Current R&amp;D activities at NIR Technologies Inc. are focused on the development of quantitative analysis of fatty acids in fats &amp; Oils and  food products.  We have currently specific models available for licensing for use with Fourier Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy. This technology has the speed of FTIR as well as the specificity of the Gas Chromatography method which are both industry standards.<br>

                            The new Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (Nutrition Labelling, Nutrient Content Claims and Health Claims) for oils/fats and food products came into effect on December 12, 2002 and it stipulates that companies must now include fatty acid composition, particularly trans fatty acids on product labels by December 2005. The final ruling by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for labelling trans fatty acids content of food products was published on July 11, 2003 with an effective date of January 1, 2006. <br>
<br>
An analytical technique is now available, using Fourier Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy, that combines the speed of Fourier Transform Infrared (an official AOCS method Cd 14d-99) and specificity &amp; accuracy of Gas Chromatography (an official AOCS method Ce 1f-96) to give full fatty acid profiling of edible oils. Using this technique, NIR Technologies has developed patent pending (US Patent Application No. 10/840277) calibration models, in conjunction with Bruker optics FT-NIR instruments, to determine the Fatty Acid concentrations in edible oils in about a minute.<br>

                            What is NIR? Near Infrared spectroscopy is a non-destructive, <br>
fast accurate, and portable technology.  In simple, terms, a near <br>
infrared laser light is pointed at a sample using a fibre optic <br>
probe and the reflected signal is processed for absorption or <br>
reflectance characteristics.  In other words, we take a chemical <br>
fingerprint of a material using infrared light at a specific <br>
point in time. A complete scanning process is done in a few <br>
seconds. <br>
<br>
Once an absorption spectrum of a non-metallic material is <br>
obtained and stored electronically, it can be used as a reference <br>
for chemical fingerprinting of materials. The NIR Technology can <br>
be used to enhance quality assurance and in quality control.  It <br>
can also be used in research and development.  Near Infrared <br>
Spectroscopy which is referred to by some as the sleeping giant <br>
of analytical chemistry, has found applications in many <br>
industries including pharmaceutical, petrochemical, polymer <br>
plastic, agricultural, food, and medical industries for both <br>

                            Are Quality Assurance and Quality Control functions important to <br>
your business?  Have you ever wondered if you could cut your <br>
quality control costs? Have you ever wished to have the <br>
opportunity to compete on a level playing field with large <br>
multinational corporations in the area of quality control?<br>
<br>
WE CAN SHOW YOU HOW.<br>
<br>
NIR Technologies Inc. was established to assist you in realizing <br>
those advantages.  We are equipped with Fourier Transform Near <br>
Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIR) which is a comparative method that <br>
can be used as a quality control tool or in receipt-inspection to <br>
fingerprint (chemical composition) non-metallic materials both <br>
liquids and solids.  Once a spectrum of a sample is obtained it <br>
can be used as a reference for future comparison purposes.  It <br>
can be used in raw material inspection, on-line during <br>
processing, or QC of finished products.<br>

Fourier Transformation Near Infrared (FT-NIR) Spectroscopy<br>
<br>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980. In 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight. Of these over 200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese. 65% of the world&#39;s population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight. More than 40 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide. <br>
<br>
<br>
FT-NIR Spectroscopy is the latest technology used as a simple, fast, reliable, non-invasive, cost-effective and accurate method to measure body fat content. While there are many techniques used to measure body fat, FT-NIR Spectroscopy has proven to be comparable to very accurate methods, such as, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). <br>
<br>
<br>
This technique is fast, accurate, reliable, non-invasive and cost-effective. <br>

                            NIR Technologies Inc. currently holds a Drug Establishment Licence (# 101313-A) issued by Health Canada for the identification of packaging materials.<br>
<br>
Fourier Transform Near Infrared spectroscopy has established itself as a fast, accurate, reliable, cost effective and  non-destructive measurement method for the identification of materials and Quality Control and Quality Assurance. For example, for one of our pharmaceutical customers, we have developed and implemented an identification method for the packaging components. As a result, the waiting period for analysis was reduced from ten days, with the previous technique, to same day service. <br>
 <br>
We can provide the same day service once we have included your packaging material in our identification library.<br>
<br>
Contact us if you are interested to speed up your production runs and need the same day analysis of the packaging material.<br>

            What is NIR?  Near Infrared Spectroscopy.<br>
<br>
-  In simple terms, a near infrared laser light is pointed at a sample using fibre optic probe and the reflected signal is processed for absorption or reflectance characteristics.  In other word, we take a <br>
chemical fingerprint of a material using infrared light at a <br>
specific point in time.<br>
<br>
- In spectroscopic terms, NIR means the measurement of the <br>
wavelength and intensities of the absorption of near infrared <br>
light by a sample.  The absorption or reflectance spectrum is <br>
directly proportional to the chemical composition of the sample.<br>
<br>
- In economical terms, near infrared means fast, accurate, <br>
reliable, cost-effective and non-destructive measurement for <br>
identification of materials and quality control.<br>
<br>
Near Infrared Spectroscopy has established itself as a non-destructive tool for identification of cable insulation in nuclear power plants.  NIR Technologies Inc.&#39;s founder  was responsible <br>
for the development and implementation of this technology at one of the top electric power producers in North America.  <br>
<br>
NIR Technologies Inc.  provided this services to RCM Technologies at Bruce power in the restart of units 3 &amp; 4 and continues to do the same in  the restart of  units 1 &amp; 2.<br>
<br>
Current R&amp;D activities at NIR Technologies Inc. are focused on the development of quantitative analysis of fatty acids in fats &amp; Oils and  food products.  We have currently specific models available for licensing for use with Fourier Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy.
