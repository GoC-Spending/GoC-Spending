                            Employees who notice that their well-being is important to their employers take the companys success to heart and are absent less often for health-related reasons. Health &amp; Wellness goes beyond employee health, it needs to be the heartbeat of the company. This will create a healthy, wealthy workplace both financially, enviromentally and physically.<br>

                            Corporate Overview of Beyond Rewards Outplacement Services:  <br>
<br>
Beyond Rewards provides individual, one-on-one outplacement services at a price point below many group seminar outplacement options, enabling employers to make the benefits of personalized career transition services available to all displaced employees within their organization rather than limiting availability to the executive level. <br>
<br>
Our consultants work with all displaced workers, from executive-level employees, Directors of Operations, Sales Managers, Sales Representatives, Marketing Directors, Marketing Managers, Plant Managers, Project Managers, IT Directors, Software Engineers, Network Administrators, Consultants, Construction Project Managers, Auditors, Accounting Specialists, production personnel and administrative support staff in partnership with your Human Resources Specialists on staff and or Senior Management.  Prices are geared to client needs or package options are available.<br>
<br>
Beyond Rewards Consultants are trained in Career Coaching, Assessments and one on one mentoring, have or are working towards our CHRP designation in Human Resources, Career Counseling, with Psychometrics Certification for Career Profiles and other Assessments.  <br>
<br>
Organizations that provide outplacement services build a culture of inclusiveness and a feeling of valued importance amongst employees.  The outplacement program instills:<br>
<br>
Morale and Corporate Well Being<br>
Corporations/Organizations that provide outplacement services to exiting employees create a warmth and holistic caring attitude not only to the exiting employee but also within the organization for those who remain within.  <br>
Corporate Loyalty<br>
Corporate Loyalty is vital to the success of your business.  A poorly handled termination not only affects the individual, it affects the morale and company loyalty of all other employees. It is critical to retain your employees (talent).  <br>
Motivation<br>
Beyond Rewards can help you reassure, motivate and reward workers remaining in the workplace. Employees not leaving the organization will  scrutinize decisions that management have made in navigating these difficult circumstances with consequences for employee productivity and motivation.<br>
Your Brand <br>
Exiting Employees may bad-mouth your organization.  By providing an exit process that assists them often reduces or alleviates the negative impact.  Your brand is important.  <br>
Liabilities:<br>
Outplacement Services reduce the risk of legal action by ensuring a termination is handled with fairness and dignity to all.<br>
<br>
The Process:<br>
<br>
Beyond Rewards focuses on the outplaced workers  the employee leaving your organization that may have been with you their entire career or just a short time; either scenario is often difficult. <br>
<br>
Our Outplacement Service for Administrative Workers is very comprehensive.  First steps will be a career profile.  The career profile will identify their career preferences.  This step often provides our clients with alternative career choices that they may not have considered otherwise. This step provides an opportunity to expand their choices.  Next a self assessment will be completed.  This step is provided in a workbook designed to assist the outplaced employee as they begin to plan for their career search or career change process.  <br>
<br>
We understand this is a challenging time of transition and the workbook is designed to help plan next steps and decide what actions are right for your employees.  Information and resources contained in this workbook will help conduct an effective job search.  <br>
<br>
Job hunting is not a skill you engage on a frequent basis.  Therefore, proficiency is not likely to be at the highest level.  Success in this endeavor requires a degree of expertise and effort.  The workbook will help build the needed job searching skills to be successful.  While no one has all the answers, the correct use of this information can provide a competitive edge in conducting a job search.<br>

In addition to the workbook, the career counselor assigned will work closely with the outplaced employee, assisting and guiding through the process; assessing career goals and job skills requirements.  Should the candidate need to brush up on technical skills, the opportunity to do so through our in-house training modules are available to them.  <br>
<br>
Self-Assessment:<br>
<br>
Overview  (from the outplaced employees perspective)<br>
Although this introspective process demands courage and, at times, painful honesty, the end result will be well worth the effort. By defining oneself, perhaps for the very first time, you will begin to develop a clearer understanding of your personal needs. Through this process, youll identify the challenges necessary to give you satisfaction, as well as the work environment that best supports your needs. Each of us has internal, as well as external needs, and the right job must satisfy both.<br>
<br>
The purposes for self-assessment include:<br>
	Reviewing your current situation, past experience, personal needs, and financial situation.<br>
	Deciding what aspects of past work have given you satisfaction<br>
	Becoming knowledgeable about your accomplishments, skills, and experience.<br>
<br>
How much emphasis should you place on self-assessment?  That depends.  Do you know exactly what you want to do? Have you analyzed your strengths and skills?  Have you developed a clear sense of what you need to be happy and fulfilled at work?  Do you know what skills can be transferred to a new job or career?  Have you defined the ideal work environment that matches your requirements?  If so, your time spent on self-assessment will be less than others.<br>
<br>

                            Employees who notice that their well-being is important to their employers take the companys success to heart and are absent less often for health-related reasons. Health &amp; Wellness goes beyond employee health, it needs to be the heartbeat of the company. This will create a healthy, wealthy workplace both financially, enviromentally and physically.<br>

                            Corporate Overview of Beyond Rewards Outplacement Services:  <br>
<br>
Beyond Rewards provides individual, one-on-one outplacement services at a price point below many group seminar outplacement options, enabling employers to make the benefits of personalized career transition services available to all displaced employees within their organization rather than limiting availability to the executive level. <br>
<br>
Our consultants work with all displaced workers, from executive-level employees, Directors of Operations, Sales Managers, Sales Representatives, Marketing Directors, Marketing Managers, Plant Managers, Project Managers, IT Directors, Software Engineers, Network Administrators, Consultants, Construction Project Managers, Auditors, Accounting Specialists, production personnel and administrative support staff in partnership with your Human Resources Specialists on staff and or Senior Management.  Prices are geared to client needs or package options are available.<br>
<br>
Beyond Rewards Consultants are trained in Career Coaching, Assessments and one on one mentoring, have or are working towards our CHRP designation in Human Resources, Career Counseling, with Psychometrics Certification for Career Profiles and other Assessments.  <br>
<br>
Organizations that provide outplacement services build a culture of inclusiveness and a feeling of valued importance amongst employees.  The outplacement program instills:<br>
<br>
Morale and Corporate Well Being<br>
Corporations/Organizations that provide outplacement services to exiting employees create a warmth and holistic caring attitude not only to the exiting employee but also within the organization for those who remain within.  <br>
Corporate Loyalty<br>
Corporate Loyalty is vital to the success of your business.  A poorly handled termination not only affects the individual, it affects the morale and company loyalty of all other employees. It is critical to retain your employees (talent).  <br>
Motivation<br>
Beyond Rewards can help you reassure, motivate and reward workers remaining in the workplace. Employees not leaving the organization will  scrutinize decisions that management have made in navigating these difficult circumstances with consequences for employee productivity and motivation.<br>
Your Brand <br>
Exiting Employees may bad-mouth your organization.  By providing an exit process that assists them often reduces or alleviates the negative impact.  Your brand is important.  <br>
Liabilities:<br>
Outplacement Services reduce the risk of legal action by ensuring a termination is handled with fairness and dignity to all.<br>
<br>
The Process:<br>
<br>
Beyond Rewards focuses on the outplaced workers  the employee leaving your organization that may have been with you their entire career or just a short time; either scenario is often difficult. <br>
<br>
Our Outplacement Service for Administrative Workers is very comprehensive.  First steps will be a career profile.  The career profile will identify their career preferences.  This step often provides our clients with alternative career choices that they may not have considered otherwise. This step provides an opportunity to expand their choices.  Next a self assessment will be completed.  This step is provided in a workbook designed to assist the outplaced employee as they begin to plan for their career search or career change process.  <br>
<br>
We understand this is a challenging time of transition and the workbook is designed to help plan next steps and decide what actions are right for your employees.  Information and resources contained in this workbook will help conduct an effective job search.  <br>
<br>
Job hunting is not a skill you engage on a frequent basis.  Therefore, proficiency is not likely to be at the highest level.  Success in this endeavor requires a degree of expertise and effort.  The workbook will help build the needed job searching skills to be successful.  While no one has all the answers, the correct use of this information can provide a competitive edge in conducting a job search.<br>
<br>
In addition to the workbook, the career counselor assigned will work closely with the outplaced employee, assisting and guiding through the process; assessing career goals and job skills requirements.  Should the candidate need to brush up on technical skills, the opportunity to do so through our in-house training modules are available to them.  <br>
<br>
Self-Assessment:<br>
<br>
Overview  (from the outplaced employees perspective)<br>
Although this introspective process demands courage and, at times, painful honesty, the end result will be well worth the effort. By defining oneself, perhaps for the very first time, you will begin to develop a clearer understanding of your personal needs. Through this process, youll identify the challenges necessary to give you satisfaction, as well as the work environment that best supports your needs. Each of us has internal, as well as external needs, and the right job must satisfy both.<br>
<br>
The purposes for self-assessment include:<br>
	Reviewing your current situation, past experience, personal needs, and financial situation.<br>
	Deciding what aspects of past work have given you satisfaction<br>
	Becoming knowledgeable about your accomplishments, skills, and experience.<br>
<br>
How much emphasis should you place on self-assessment?  That depends.  Do you know exactly what you want to do? Have you analyzed your strengths and skills?  Have you developed a clear sense of what you need to be happy and fulfilled at work?  Do you know what skills can be transferred to a new job or career?  Have you defined the ideal work environment that matches your requirements?  If so, your time spent on self-assessment will be less than others.<br>
<br>

Lynne possesses a great deal of business expertice that fits nicely with her role as an HR professional. Lynne is approachable, accommodating, resourceful and decisive in her dealings with every aspect of business that she is involved. Being in business and having Lynne on your team would be to any business leaders benefit. January 19, 2009 <br>
