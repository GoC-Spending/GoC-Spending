                        Speedi-Bleed has been sold to aprox 50% of all automotive and brake repair shops in the greater Vancouver Canada area, including over 50 new car dealerships.  The aim is to achieve a 10% market coverage of all automotive repair facilties in North America, and to branch out into other markets, such as schools, motor cycle industry, and the DIY market via lower cost / feature products.<br>
<br>
Like most professional trades people, many auto repair technicians can resist change , if the benefits of using a new product / procedure cannot be fully and easily demonstrated.  Comparison to previous or existing brake pressure bleeder tools is the most difficult barrier to overcome, in order to fully realize sales success of Speedi-Bleed in the professional techician market.  One area of concentration for maximizing sales numbers, is the proper education of younger automotive technicians  just entering the workforce. A comprehensive school marketing program (both trade and high school), will pay off not only short term with increased sales, but long term by educating and familiarizing our customers of the future , on the benefits of using Speedi-Bleed.   For certain a prospective customer that was without any negative opinion towards pressure brake bleeding devices would be a most likely result of an intensive school marketing program.  <br>
<br>
With both, the established auto tech, and the trainee in school, a well defined mulit faceted marketing program aimed at the professional technician market, would increase the sales numbers throughout North America, and allow for the option to expand overseas.   <br>
<br>
8000 Speedi-Bleed tools have been sold to-date, with a conservative estimate being a total of 80,000 units sold over the next 10 years with gross sales of $20,000,000 (USD million).  A marketing and sales budget of $200,000 per anum would be neded to achieve the targeted sales figures in the professional technician market.<br>
<br>
The DIY market is where potential sales fugures of Speedi-Bleed really get exciting with the much larger upside.  A conservative estimate would put the total number of Speedi-Bleed tools that could be sold to the DIY market, in the area of 2-5 million units throughout North America, for total gross sales of $150,000,000 to $300,000,000 (USD million)   The estimated marketing / sales budget to achieve the targeted sales numbers to the DIY would be $500,000 per anum.<br>
<br>
The large scale introduction of Speedi-Bleed into the DIY market, will allow any back yard repair person the option to purchase and use a totally professional brake pressure bleeder, at a cost that is within DIY price levels. Never before has a brake pressure bleeder been designed and built first for the professional repair industry, and then packaged and priced for the DIY market.   Speedi-Bleed will give the vast majority of the DIY market the option for the first time, to use a professional quality brake pressure bleeder product.  Most DIY have never seen a pro brake pressure bleeder, let alone purchase and use one.  <br>
<br>
Speedi-Bleed will have our complete K01A  kit with all 7 adapters, targeted to the professional techician / shop owner at a price of $349-389 USD.  The new DIY kits will be sold retail for $59-$99 and will include a single adapter plus a lower price pressure bottle.

              <h4>
                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              Pressurized brake bleding equipment has been around for over 30-40 years, and has generally received a neutral or negative approval from most automotive technicians and shop owners.  The tools of the past cost $500-1000 and were mainly used as a last resort or for only problem jobs.  The reasons being the tools were too slow in hooking up, adapter leakage, and too many different adapters. <br>
      I started developing Speedi-Bleed in 1991 with the goal of overcoming the shortcomings described above..  Speedi-Bleed started selling in 1995 with only 4 adapters and today has a total of 7 adapters.  The Speedi-Bleed rubber gaskets are softer, thicker, and combined with our unique strap (versus chains or bungee chords), well constructed adapters, and the hand held pressure regulator,  allows for much faster hookup and setting of the working pressure.    The key benefit of Speedi-Bleed is to give the user much more control and ease over setting the working pressure, and allow the user to correct any leakage that might occur, in a prompt effective manner.<br>
<br>
Speedi-Bleed comprises 2 major components, the pressure bottle which is small, light weight, and almost toy like in its novelty.  The air source for Speedi-Bleed is any automotive tire, verus the usual shop air, or a hand pump on the bottle, that requires repeated application.  Use of the tire is fast, safe, low pressure, and allows not only total portability , but means Speedi-Bleed can be used by anyone needing to perform a brake bleed / flush, while not having access to an air compressor.  The air pressure loss from a typical tire after performing a 4 wheel brake bleed / flush, is less than 3 psi (large truck and car tires will register almost zero pressure loss). This puts the tool within easy usage of the typical DIY auto repair person.  Using the tire versus shop air, also means not having to assemble a diaphram device into  the fluid container to place a barrier between the compressed air and the brake fluid, as air compressors / shop air are renowned for creating a lot of moisture, which cannot be allowed to contact the brake fluid.<br>
While the Speedi-Bleed fluid bottle is high in the novelty factor, it is the Speedi-Bleed adapters that clearly send a strong 1st impression that you are using a top quality, functioning automotive tool.  No brake bleeder is worth much, if it can not seal the working pressure inside the master cylinder, on a consistent basis, and without leakage.  The adapters need to be simple, fast connecting, leak resistant, and as close to one size fits all as possible (to keep the number of adapters to a minimum).  Speedi-Bleed has the best set of adapters on the market, from any pressure brake bleeder sold at any price, and we will always strive to improve and keep ahead of the competition.  We have had 2 competing companies purchase our adapters, to add to their own pressure bleeder products (selling in the $4000 range).   Our adapters are considered of high quality and function, that they are suitable for inclusion in a product costing 10 times the price of Speedi-Bleed.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Speedi-Bleed has a long list of satisfied customers and we have obtained many testonials explaining their positive experiences using our product.  The most drastic implementation of Speedi-Bleed by most of our customers, is that before they purchased our product, they had a bad opinion of brake pressure bleeder products in general.    Speedi-Bleed is now used by over 8000 repair shops, with many using it as their 1st choice method of brake bleeding / flushing.<br>
Repair shop owners no longer spend $500-1000 on a piece of equipment that will be seldom used, and often discover that their employess enjoy using Speedi-Bleed.  An easy using product that technicians like using, will also result in faster more effective brake flushes, meaning our customers do not have to view this type of purchase as an expense, but instead can consider Speedi-Bleed, a revenue generator (a typical brake fluid flush can be billed at $45-65 to the owner of the vehicle).<br>
<br>
To better highlight the implementation of Speedi-Bleed, below are 2 customer comments:<br>
<br>
1.  &quot;I just wanted to let you know how exceptional the SpeediBleed Brake Bleeding System is. We purchased our brake bleeder in December of 1998, and use it at least once a week.  In our business where we typically purchase equipment that exceeds tens of thousands of dollars it is rare that we actually find a piece of equipment that not only meets but exceeds our expectations. <br>
<br>
I can honestly say that our SpeediBleed brake bleeder is one of these exceptions. This product is without a doubt one piece of equipment that any repair shop doing brake service should own. I would not hesitate to recommend your brake bleeder to anyone and challenge them to compare it to any other tool or method that they are currently using because if they do, they will see for themselves that this is one piece of equipment that they cannot do without. <br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              1.  &quot;Im part of Ford Asset which is a 2 year Ford exclusive technical training program. During our class we experimented with many different types of brake bleeder. Not only to find the best one, but to find what kind of faults and benefits each exhibit. I believe we experimented with 7 or 8 ways to bleed brakes,i.e. pressure, vacuum &amp; pressure brake bleeder combined,and out of all those ,our class found Speedi-Bleed to be not only the easiest but the most versatile. <br>
For instance on some late model Ford Ranger&#39;s a technician can literally spend hours trying to bleed a slave cylinder on the clutch, but can be finished within minutes using Speedi-Bleed. The simplicity with which you hookup this tool and the adapters makes this brake bleeder the one to grab when the job needed to get done, and I think we can all agree that what&#39;s easy gets done. <br>
 I told my service manager at Diehl Ford about Speedi-Bleed, as he was preparing to buy a $4500 brake bleeder machine. I told him it was a waste of money and that your product was better,cheaper,and that he could buy more of them and still come out ahead in the long run if he went with Speedi-Bleed. <br>

6.  &quot;Simple, fast hookup and works great. I spent a lot of years twisting wrenches in dealerships before changing  careers, and this is the best pressure brake bleeder I&#39;ve ever used&quot;<br>

                        Speedi-Bleed has been sold to aprox 50% of all automotive and brake repair shops in the greater Vancouver Canada area, including over 50 new car dealerships.  The aim is to achieve a 10% market coverage of all automotive repair facilties in North America, and to branch out into other markets, such as schools, motor cycle industry, and the DIY market via lower cost / feature products.<br>
<br>
Like most professional trades people, many auto repair technicians can resist change , if the benefits of using a new product / procedure cannot be fully and easily demonstrated.  Comparison to previous or existing brake pressure bleeder tools is the most difficult barrier to overcome, in order to fully realize sales success of Speedi-Bleed in the professional techician market.  One area of concentration for maximizing sales numbers, is the proper education of younger automotive technicians  just entering the workforce. A comprehensive school marketing program (both trade and high school), will pay off not only short term with increased sales, but long term by educating and familiarizing our customers of the future , on the benefits of using Speedi-Bleed.   For certain a prospective customer that was without any negative opinion towards pressure brake bleeding devices would be a most likely result of an intensive school marketing program.  <br>
<br>
With both, the established auto tech, and the trainee in school, a well defined mulit faceted marketing program aimed at the professional technician market, would increase the sales numbers throughout North America, and allow for the option to expand overseas.   <br>
<br>
8000 Speedi-Bleed tools have been sold to-date, with a conservative estimate being a total of 80,000 units sold over the next 10 years with gross sales of $20,000,000 (USD million).  A marketing and sales budget of $200,000 per anum would be neded to achieve the targeted sales figures in the professional technician market.<br>
<br>
The DIY market is where potential sales fugures of Speedi-Bleed really get exciting with the much larger upside.  A conservative estimate would put the total number of Speedi-Bleed tools that could be sold to the DIY market, in the area of 2-5 million units throughout North America, for total gross sales of $150,000,000 to $300,000,000 (USD million)   The estimated marketing / sales budget to achieve the targeted sales numbers to the DIY would be $500,000 per anum.<br>
<br>
The large scale introduction of Speedi-Bleed into the DIY market, will allow any back yard repair person the option to purchase and use a totally professional brake pressure bleeder, at a cost that is within DIY price levels. Never before has a brake pressure bleeder been designed and built first for the professional repair industry, and then packaged and priced for the DIY market.   Speedi-Bleed will give the vast majority of the DIY market the option for the first time, to use a professional quality brake pressure bleeder product.  Most DIY have never seen a pro brake pressure bleeder, let alone purchase and use one.  <br>
<br>
Speedi-Bleed will have our complete K01A  kit with all 7 adapters, targeted to the professional techician / shop owner at a price of $349-389 USD.  The new DIY kits will be sold retail for $59-$99 and will include a single adapter plus a lower price pressure bottle.

              <h4>
                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              Pressurized brake bleding equipment has been around for over 30-40 years, and has generally received a neutral or negative approval from most automotive technicians and shop owners.  The tools of the past cost $500-1000 and were mainly used as a last resort or for only problem jobs.  The reasons being the tools were too slow in hooking up, adapter leakage, and too many different adapters. <br>
      I started developing Speedi-Bleed in 1991 with the goal of overcoming the shortcomings described above..  Speedi-Bleed started selling in 1995 with only 4 adapters and today has a total of 7 adapters.  The Speedi-Bleed rubber gaskets are softer, thicker, and combined with our unique strap (versus chains or bungee chords), well constructed adapters, and the hand held pressure regulator,  allows for much faster hookup and setting of the working pressure.    The key benefit of Speedi-Bleed is to give the user much more control and ease over setting the working pressure, and allow the user to correct any leakage that might occur, in a prompt effective manner.<br>
<br>
Speedi-Bleed comprises 2 major components, the pressure bottle which is small, light weight, and almost toy like in its novelty.  The air source for Speedi-Bleed is any automotive tire, verus the usual shop air, or a hand pump on the bottle, that requires repeated application.  Use of the tire is fast, safe, low pressure, and allows not only total portability , but means Speedi-Bleed can be used by anyone needing to perform a brake bleed / flush, while not having access to an air compressor.  The air pressure loss from a typical tire after performing a 4 wheel brake bleed / flush, is less than 3 psi (large truck and car tires will register almost zero pressure loss). This puts the tool within easy usage of the typical DIY auto repair person.  Using the tire versus shop air, also means not having to assemble a diaphram device into  the fluid container to place a barrier between the compressed air and the brake fluid, as air compressors / shop air are renowned for creating a lot of moisture, which cannot be allowed to contact the brake fluid.<br>
While the Speedi-Bleed fluid bottle is high in the novelty factor, it is the Speedi-Bleed adapters that clearly send a strong 1st impression that you are using a top quality, functioning automotive tool.  No brake bleeder is worth much, if it can not seal the working pressure inside the master cylinder, on a consistent basis, and without leakage.  The adapters need to be simple, fast connecting, leak resistant, and as close to one size fits all as possible (to keep the number of adapters to a minimum).  Speedi-Bleed has the best set of adapters on the market, from any pressure brake bleeder sold at any price, and we will always strive to improve and keep ahead of the competition.  We have had 2 competing companies purchase our adapters, to add to their own pressure bleeder products (selling in the $4000 range).   Our adapters are considered of high quality and function, that they are suitable for inclusion in a product costing 10 times the price of Speedi-Bleed.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Speedi-Bleed has a long list of satisfied customers and we have obtained many testonials explaining their positive experiences using our product.  The most drastic implementation of Speedi-Bleed by most of our customers, is that before they purchased our product, they had a bad opinion of brake pressure bleeder products in general.    Speedi-Bleed is now used by over 8000 repair shops, with many using it as their 1st choice method of brake bleeding / flushing.<br>
Repair shop owners no longer spend $500-1000 on a piece of equipment that will be seldom used, and often discover that their employess enjoy using Speedi-Bleed.  An easy using product that technicians like using, will also result in faster more effective brake flushes, meaning our customers do not have to view this type of purchase as an expense, but instead can consider Speedi-Bleed, a revenue generator (a typical brake fluid flush can be billed at $45-65 to the owner of the vehicle).<br>
<br>
To better highlight the implementation of Speedi-Bleed, below are 2 customer comments:<br>
<br>
1.  &quot;I just wanted to let you know how exceptional the SpeediBleed Brake Bleeding System is. We purchased our brake bleeder in December of 1998, and use it at least once a week.  In our business where we typically purchase equipment that exceeds tens of thousands of dollars it is rare that we actually find a piece of equipment that not only meets but exceeds our expectations. <br>
<br>
I can honestly say that our SpeediBleed brake bleeder is one of these exceptions. This product is without a doubt one piece of equipment that any repair shop doing brake service should own. I would not hesitate to recommend your brake bleeder to anyone and challenge them to compare it to any other tool or method that they are currently using because if they do, they will see for themselves that this is one piece of equipment that they cannot do without. <br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              1.  &quot;Im part of Ford Asset which is a 2 year Ford exclusive technical training program. During our class we experimented with many different types of brake bleeder. Not only to find the best one, but to find what kind of faults and benefits each exhibit. I believe we experimented with 7 or 8 ways to bleed brakes,i.e. pressure, vacuum &amp; pressure brake bleeder combined,and out of all those ,our class found Speedi-Bleed to be not only the easiest but the most versatile. <br>
For instance on some late model Ford Ranger&#39;s a technician can literally spend hours trying to bleed a slave cylinder on the clutch, but can be finished within minutes using Speedi-Bleed. The simplicity with which you hookup this tool and the adapters makes this brake bleeder the one to grab when the job needed to get done, and I think we can all agree that what&#39;s easy gets done. <br>
 I told my service manager at Diehl Ford about Speedi-Bleed, as he was preparing to buy a $4500 brake bleeder machine. I told him it was a waste of money and that your product was better,cheaper,and that he could buy more of them and still come out ahead in the long run if he went with Speedi-Bleed. <br>

6.  &quot;Simple, fast hookup and works great. I spent a lot of years twisting wrenches in dealerships before changing  careers, and this is the best pressure brake bleeder I&#39;ve ever used&quot;<br>
