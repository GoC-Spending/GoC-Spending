              ERIN MCLEOD, Canadian National Team &amp; Washington Freedom, Womens Pro Soccer League<br>
November 29, 2009: My name is Erin McLeod and I am a keeper for the Canadian National Team as well as the Women&#39;s Professional soccer team, Washington Freedom. I had the privilege of working with Sanjeev&#39;s +20 program born in 1996/97 for a number of weeks in Ottawa. I can honestly say that I have never seen so much talent for such a young group of girls. Their technical ability alone is better than any girls I have seen at that age anywhere in the USA and Canada. Sanjeev&#39;s focus to technical detail along with Kristina Kiss&#39;s focus on tactics allows for an incredible learning environment. This group had homework assignments every week, two girls per session were in charge of the team warm up, they shake all the coaches hands before and after practice, they have prepared resumes for possible universities; this is a team of professionals determined to be better people and players. Sanjeev and all of his coaching staff expect the most out of their players every session and this passionate group consistently delivers. I was able to run a few warm up drills for the entire group as well as work with the keepers. I noticed immediately that regardless of who is running the drills this group is eager to learn and listen, a group of girls like this is why people coach in the first place. They train like it is their career and I expect for most of them one day it will be.<br>
<br>
ELLIOT SIMMONS, Ottawa Fury Academy, U11<br>
December 10, 2008: Elliot has supplemented his regular club training with Parmar Sports for the past three years. He has just spent a succesful period of time training with Arsenal FC U11 boys in the UK and has recently received additional training/trial offers from West ham Utd and Chelsea FC . Having spoken to scouts/coaches from these three clubs, it is very apparant that the most important attributes they are looking for in young players between 8-12 is natural ability and mastery of the ball, ie First touch and overall technical ability etc. Other advanced tactical aspects of the game as it gets faster through the ages cannot be achieved unless these fundementals are in place first . Sanjeev&#39;s huge influence on Elliot over the years cannot be underestimated and his attention to technical detail has really made a difference, and played a significant role in Elliot being identified for these trial opportunities. If you take your game seriously, Put your trust in Sanjeev, I don&#39;t believe there is a better technical coach in the Ottawa area. We look forward to many more years of your programs.<br>
<br>
NESS TIMMONS, Canadian National Team Coach for World University Games 2003 and University of Cape Breton Women&#39;s Soccer, Nova Scotia<br>
October 12, 2003: &quot;Sanjeev makes the speed, agility, and quickness sessions sport specific. He has a way of taking the athletes to that next level. That explosive power is what we want in all our players and Sanjeev has the knack to bring it out.&quot;

                International capital projects:
              </h4>
         
              Parmar Sports Training Inc. has developed a great relationship with Youth Football Club Rurka Kalan in Punjab, India and Birtil Sinclair Soccer Academy in Trinidad and Tobago since 2008. <br>
<br>
Sanjeev travels to India at least once a year to work with YFC and was involved in a recent project in September 2010. He helped develop an instructional DVD in Punjabi which covered 25 session plans for coaches coaching 12 - 15 year old players.<br>
<br>
In association with the Australian Sports Commission and the Sports Department of Punjab, India, Gurmangal Das, president of Youth Football Club Rurka Kalan invited Sanjeev Parmar to Punjab, India to run a six day Grassroots Coaches Training Program. The program was organized from December 15 - 20 at the YFC academy in Rurkakalan, India. The program attracted 25 coaches from around various villages and cities in the state of Punjab. Coaches came from with different personal coaching backgrounds with the intention of learning and growing as coaches. <br>
<br>
We are continuously collecting soccer cleats and would love to collect them from you. The equipment will be dispersed to under priviliged children participating in the YFC satellite projects in the neighboring communities.

              In 2010 Sanjeev was the recipient of the prestigious Ottawa Business Journal Forty Under 40 award. Sanjeev received his CSA A License in the summer of 2007 and became one of the youngest coaches in the country to have achieved the highest coaching level for soccer in Canada. Sanjeev has been an Ontario Soccer Association Staff Coach / Course Conductor since 2003. In October 2010, Sanjeev was selected by the Ontario Soccer Association to participate in the first ever FIFA Futsal Course for Coaches. He is also certified with his NCCP Level II.

              </h4>
           
              ERIN MCLEOD, Canadian National Team &amp; Washington Freedom, Womens Pro Soccer League<br>
November 29, 2009: My name is Erin McLeod and I am a keeper for the Canadian National Team as well as the Women&#39;s Professional soccer team, Washington Freedom. I had the privilege of working with Sanjeev&#39;s +20 program born in 1996/97 for a number of weeks in Ottawa. I can honestly say that I have never seen so much talent for such a young group of girls. Their technical ability alone is better than any girls I have seen at that age anywhere in the USA and Canada. Sanjeev&#39;s focus to technical detail along with Kristina Kiss&#39;s focus on tactics allows for an incredible learning environment. This group had homework assignments every week, two girls per session were in charge of the team warm up, they shake all the coaches hands before and after practice, they have prepared resumes for possible universities; this is a team of professionals determined to be better people and players. Sanjeev and all of his coaching staff expect the most out of their players every session and this passionate group consistently delivers. I was able to run a few warm up drills for the entire group as well as work with the keepers. I noticed immediately that regardless of who is running the drills this group is eager to learn and listen, a group of girls like this is why people coach in the first place. They train like it is their career and I expect for most of them one day it will be.<br>
<br>
ELLIOT SIMMONS, Ottawa Fury Academy, U11<br>
December 10, 2008: Elliot has supplemented his regular club training with Parmar Sports for the past three years. He has just spent a succesful period of time training with Arsenal FC U11 boys in the UK and has recently received additional training/trial offers from West ham Utd and Chelsea FC . Having spoken to scouts/coaches from these three clubs, it is very apparant that the most important attributes they are looking for in young players between 8-12 is natural ability and mastery of the ball, ie First touch and overall technical ability etc. Other advanced tactical aspects of the game as it gets faster through the ages cannot be achieved unless these fundementals are in place first . Sanjeev&#39;s huge influence on Elliot over the years cannot be underestimated and his attention to technical detail has really made a difference, and played a significant role in Elliot being identified for these trial opportunities. If you take your game seriously, Put your trust in Sanjeev, I don&#39;t believe there is a better technical coach in the Ottawa area. We look forward to many more years of your programs.<br>
<br>
NESS TIMMONS, Canadian National Team Coach for World University Games 2003 and University of Cape Breton Women&#39;s Soccer, Nova Scotia<br>
October 12, 2003: &quot;Sanjeev makes the speed, agility, and quickness sessions sport specific. He has a way of taking the athletes to that next level. That explosive power is what we want in all our players and Sanjeev has the knack to bring it out.&quot;
           
            
        
                
     
  
    

    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                International capital projects:
              </h4>
         
              Parmar Sports Training Inc. has developed a great relationship with Youth Football Club Rurka Kalan in Punjab, India and Birtil Sinclair Soccer Academy in Trinidad and Tobago since 2008. <br>
<br>
Sanjeev travels to India at least once a year to work with YFC and was involved in a recent project in September 2010. He helped develop an instructional DVD in Punjabi which covered 25 session plans for coaches coaching 12 - 15 year old players.<br>
<br>
In association with the Australian Sports Commission and the Sports Department of Punjab, India, Gurmangal Das, president of Youth Football Club Rurka Kalan invited Sanjeev Parmar to Punjab, India to run a six day Grassroots Coaches Training Program. The program was organized from December 15 - 20 at the YFC academy in Rurkakalan, India. The program attracted 25 coaches from around various villages and cities in the state of Punjab. Coaches came from with different personal coaching backgrounds with the intention of learning and growing as coaches. <br>
<br>
We are continuously collecting soccer cleats and would love to collect them from you. The equipment will be dispersed to under priviliged children participating in the YFC satellite projects in the neighboring communities.
