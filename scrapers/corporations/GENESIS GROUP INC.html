                            A/F Protein Inc.&#39;s principal focus is to develop the commercial <br>
potential of a group of proteins known as antifreeze proteins.  <br>
The antifreeze proteins have been shown to be highly effective in <br>
preserving mammalian tissues and organs under conditions of cold <br>
and freezing, which would normally result in their destruction.  <br>
In addition, the gene which controls the production of antifreeze <br>
proteins has been successfully spliced with a fish growth hormone <br>
gene (a ``transgene``) to produce fish that grow at a rate <br>
dramatically faster that presently known fish (salmon).<br>
<br>
As a result of these discoveries, A/F Proteins Inc. Has <br>
identified significant business opportunities in the fields of <br>
medicine , agriculture, aquaculture, food preservation and <br>
biological research.  Currently, purified antifreeze proteins are <br>
for sale to the research community and to industry; license <br>
agreements for use of anti-freeze proteins in cryogenic <br>
solutions, preservation of bovine embryos, production of <br>
transgenic salmon for aquaculture, and the development of <br>
transgenic salon brood stock are being secured.<br>

                            A bacterial enzyme has been developed to provide a means of <br>
producing Cheddar cheese with a reduced ripening period.  When <br>
the enzyme is added to raw, pasteurized or partially pasteurized <br>
milk used for cheese making it accelerate the cheese ripening <br>
process.  The enzyme has no direct effect on the growth of <br>
starter cultures normally employed in cheese making and can be <br>
added to the milk either before or after the addition of such <br>
starter cultures and either before or simultaneously with the <br>
addition of the renetting agent.  The manufacture of Cheddar <br>
cheese can then be carried out entirely in the conventional way <br>
to give a Cheddar cheese product which ripens more quickly than <br>
conventional Cheddar cheese, thereby reducing the considerable <br>
cost of providing storage for the ripening process.  This <br>
ripening aid can be used in conjunction with calf rennet or any <br>
rennet substitute, although those of animal origin are preferred.<br>

                            Researchers at Memorial University of Newfoundland, have <br>
conducted research on a biological control agent specifically for <br>
spruce budworm and hemlock looper and have identified a <br>
naturally-occurring fungus that uses these pests&#39; larval stage as <br>
its host.  The researches have developed a growing median for the <br>
biological reactor to produce the fungus, while having it remain <br>
virulent to spruce budworm and hemlock looper.  The concept of <br>
the use of this fungus is to dope the forest with hyphal bodies <br>
to the fungus early in the insect infestation and enhance the <br>
natural process, thereby strictly limiting the magnitude of the <br>
infestation.  This product would be a market for this technology <br>
include the provincial departments and organizations that are <br>
charged with the responsibility of forest pest control.<br>

which shows promise a sa source for pigment and protein feed for <br>
aquacultured species.  The new yeast was able to utilize a wide <br>
variety of organic nitrogen sources such as molasses and grew in <br>
a wide pH range (pH3-10).  When compared with Phaffia rhodozyma, <br>
the carotenoid yeast grew much faster attaining a much superior <br>
biomass yield. (g dry wt/L), and a greater concentration of <br>
pigment.  The new carotenoid yeast could replace the use of <br>
astaxanthin which is used primarily as a color supplement in fish <br>

                            Researches have developed an economic and practical delivery <br>
system for biological materials for use in aquaculture.  <br>
Entrapment of antigen into multi-lamellar vesicles (liposomes), <br>
has been demonstrated by MUN researches to enhance immune <br>
responses to the associated antigen.  The use of liposomes to <br>
encapsulate antigens can also adjuvant activity and potentially <br>
increase immune responses to antigens delivered via any route.  <br>
The liposomal delivery system technology can be designed to <br>
package and deliver vaccines, antibodies, vitamins and minerals, <br>
viruses and any other components requiring packaging.  This <br>
technology could improve fish quality and quantity by reducing <br>
fish disease in fish husbandry.<br>

                            Fish Feeding regimes and strategies for controlling the onset or <br>
delay of reproduction in aquaculture subjects, preferable by <br>
using cheap, naturally occurring or slightly modified food <br>
components is under investigation.  Several hey biochemical <br>
factors have been identified as being the key to manipulating <br>
reproduction in fish.  The manipulation of reproduction in other <br>
fish is being studied using the same biochemical factors.  The <br>
critical periods for when to add these biochemical factors to the <br>
feed regimes is under investigation.  The possibility that <br>
feeding can be manipulated to ``turn-off`` fish reproduction <br>
means that energy can be directed to muscle (flesh) quality <br>
rather than reproduction.  The nutritional control of fish <br>
reproduction is reversible so that fish which shoe good growth <br>
characteristics after ``turn-off`` can be subsequently used as <br>

                            The invention pertains to the use of a TRANSPORT PROTEIN used to <br>
transport and load molecules (diagnostic and pharmaceutical <br>
agents) into lipoprotein particles (LDL, VLDL, HDL) which <br>
subsequently have use as a delivery system.  One advantage of <br>
this system is that a larger amount of an ``agent`` can be loaded <br>
into a lipoprotein particle without destabilizing the delivery <br>
system and allows the system to retain the natural biological <br>
appearance of the human LDL particle.  Lipoprotein meets most of <br>
the requirements for a satisfactory drug carrier :<br>
-	they are endogenous and can avoid such typical carrier <br>
        problems as immunological reaction and rapid plasma <br>
        clearance due to uptake by reticuloendothelial cells;<br>
-	receptor-mediated endocytosis enables intracellular <br>
        uptake of the drug in specific tissues;<br>
-	lipoprotein particles are totally biodegradable;<br>
-	they provide a biocompatible vehicle for lipophilic <br>
        drugs.  This is of special importance if the drug is <br>
        prone to decomposition.<br>
<br>
The improved particles have application towards :<br>
1)development of novel anticancer therapy;<br>
2)development of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for early   <br>
detection of atherosclerosis<br>
3)development of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for detection of <br>
  tumors;<br>
4)development of specific anti-HIV drug therapy;<br>
5)potential development of specific delivery vehicles for gene   <br>
therapy<br>
6)cosmetic applications.<br>

                            The present invention relates to a novel family of immediate <br>
early response genes discovered during embryonic development.  <br>
This family of mammalian genes are transcribed in the immediate <br>
early phase following exposure to FGF during mesoderm induction, <br>
termed Mesoderm Induction Early Response (MIER) genes.  One <br>
member of this mammalian family of genes, the Er1 gene, has been <br>
found over-expressed in breast carcinoma and cervical carcinoma <br>
cell lines.  Er1 is also over expressed in an abnormal T-cell <br>
subset (CD28-) whose numbers increase with disease progression in <br>
AIDS patients.  This CD28- subset also increases in chronic <br>
inflammatory disorders.  Therefore this gene and its product are <br>
potential targets for diagnosis and treatment of various cancers <br>
as well as immune disorders such as AIDS.  This family of genes <br>
could have many uses in Cancer and AIDS diagnostic and <br>
therapeutic applications such as : use in drug design, <br>
vaccination protocols, diagnostic markers for rapidly <br>
proliferating cells, diagnostic kits containing antibodies<br>
to the gene product of any one of the gene members, use as <br>
primers in PCR amplification for R&amp;D purposes, screening <br>
assays, etc.<br>

                            Terra Nova Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (TNB) is a privately-held <br>
company based in St. John&#39;s, Newfoundland, Canada since 1988.  <br>
TNB uses its expertise in immunology and molecular biology to <br>
develop, produce, and market monoclonal antibodies for in-vitro <br>
diagnostic use.  TNB is producing a set of monoclonal antibodies, <br>
in kit form, against the polymorphism of HLA-DP that will allow <br>
tissue typing to be done by serological methods.  This will play <br>
a crucial role in matching bone marrow transplant (BMT) <br>
donors/recipients.  TNB&#39;s recent research into the Human <br>
Leucocyte Antigen, HLA-DR4, has resulted in production of <br>
monoclonal antibodies capable of recognizing the specific subsets <br>
of the HLA system that are associated with an individual&#39;s <br>
susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.  Since May 1995, the <br>
company has been marketing the NovaPRO test kit which has <br>
potential to play a key role in both the diagnosis and prognosis <br>
of rheumatoid arthritis patients.  In addition, the company <br>
undertakes genetic testing in cases of disputed paternity.  TNB <br>
also offers specialized services related to production and <br>
research such as contract mAb manufacturing and investigative R&amp;D <br>
for its customers.<br>

                            PA Pure Additions Inc., through its extensive research, has <br>
developed a powdered cooked-cured-n\meat pigment which is <br>
identical to the natural pink-colored pigment found in nitrite <br>
cured-meat.  This pigment , in combination with a sequestrant, an <br>
antioxidant and an antimicrobial agent for meat curing, has been <br>
found very effective in reproducing the color, oxidative <br>
stability and flavor, as well as the antimicrobial effects of <br>
nitrite.  The pigment combination has been applied to both solid <br>
and emulsified meat products, tested and found effective.  The <br>
sensory acceptability of this nitrite alternative has been tested <br>
through the use of blind taste-tests, with excellent results.<br>

                            The AQUALERT emits an acoustic warning signal which can be detected by whales, porpoises and dolphins at ranges exceeding 1 km, alerting them to the presence of the fishing gear and allowing them to avoid becoming entrapped.  Field tests of the AQUALERT have been conducted off the coast of New Hampshire, USA, on groundfish gillnets, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada on cod traps, and in waters off Queensland, Australia on shark gillnets.  The results showed significant reductions in the by-catch of humpback whales.<br>
<br>
The Government of Queensland was very impressed with the AQUALERT during the test<br>
program and has purchased 75 units for the continued prevention of whale entrapment.<br>
Preliminary testing of these units on groundfish gillnets has indicated promising results in<br>
reduction of harbour porpoise by-catch.<br>
<br>
The AQUALERT attaches easily to fishing gear and emits a consistent, loud acoustic warning signal which emanates in all directions at an interval which can be set to 3, 6, or 10 seconds.  The signal is well within the audible frequency range of marine mammals and can be detected at ranges of 1 km or more.  Range will vary depending on species and ambient noise levels. <br>
<br>
Features include:   Dimensions are: 30 cm height, 17 cm maximum diameter  Durable design constructed of aluminum alloy with zinc anodes to  prevent corrosion, no protruding parts to tangle with gear  Functions continuously for up to 12 weeks on one battery  Reusable, will provide many seasons of protection.   Powered by common 6 V alkaline lantern battery which is easily replaced Weighs 3.5 kg, is neutrally buoyant  AQUALERT price is $400 U.S.  Special pricing is available to those groups or organizations willing to provide documentation of by-catch data for fishing equipment protected by AQUALERT.<br>

                            The Biology Dept. At Memorial University of Newfoundland has been conducting research in a control agent for spruce budworm/hemlock looper and has identified a naturally occurring fungus that uses these pests&#39; larval stages as its hosts, and is probably a major factor in the natural collapse of the pest population. A growing medium Patent (pending) has been developed for use in a biological reactor to produce the fungus, while having it remain virulent to spruce budworm and hemlock looper!<br>
<br>
The concept of the use of this fungus is to dope the forest with hyphal bodies of the fungus early in the insect infestation, and enhance the natural process, thereby strictly limiting the magnitude of infestation. The fungus has been produced in 10 L scale fermenters, and has been tested and found effective in Forestry Canada&#39;s greenhouses.  A U.S. patent has been issued and a Canadian patent is pending.<br>

                            Bio-ID Corporation Limited was formed in 1990 to develop and <br>
promote a novel procedure referred to as Forensically Informative <br>
Nucleotide Sequencing (FINS).  This process can determine the <br>
biological origin of a specimen (i.e. the species or breed of <br>
animal from which the sample came).  Unlike conventional methods <br>
of specie identification, which usually depend on morphological <br>
characteristics of biochemical genetics which usually depend on <br>
morphological characteristics of biochemical genetics which <br>
examine proteins, FINS makes use of DNA - the molecule that <br>
contains the genetic information.  A species&#39; DNA consists of <br>
segments that are (1) unique to individuals, (2) shared by breeds <br>
or populations, (3) found in all members of that species, and (4) <br>
common in related species.  FINS combines procedures in <br>
biotechnology with a data base that is under constant <br>
construction.<br>

                            A/F Protein Inc.&#39;s principal focus is to develop the commercial <br>
potential of a group of proteins known as antifreeze proteins.  <br>
The antifreeze proteins have been shown to be highly effective in <br>
preserving mammalian tissues and organs under conditions of cold <br>
and freezing, which would normally result in their destruction.  <br>
In addition, the gene which controls the production of antifreeze <br>
proteins has been successfully spliced with a fish growth hormone <br>
gene (a ``transgene``) to produce fish that grow at a rate <br>
dramatically faster that presently known fish (salmon).<br>
<br>
As a result of these discoveries, A/F Proteins Inc. Has <br>
identified significant business opportunities in the fields of <br>
medicine , agriculture, aquaculture, food preservation and <br>
biological research.  Currently, purified antifreeze proteins are <br>
for sale to the research community and to industry; license <br>
agreements for use of anti-freeze proteins in cryogenic <br>
solutions, preservation of bovine embryos, production of <br>
transgenic salmon for aquaculture, and the development of <br>
transgenic salon brood stock are being secured.<br>

                            A bacterial enzyme has been developed to provide a means of <br>
producing Cheddar cheese with a reduced ripening period.  When <br>
the enzyme is added to raw, pasteurized or partially pasteurized <br>
milk used for cheese making it accelerate the cheese ripening <br>
process.  The enzyme has no direct effect on the growth of <br>
starter cultures normally employed in cheese making and can be <br>
added to the milk either before or after the addition of such <br>
starter cultures and either before or simultaneously with the <br>
addition of the renetting agent.  The manufacture of Cheddar <br>
cheese can then be carried out entirely in the conventional way <br>
to give a Cheddar cheese product which ripens more quickly than <br>
conventional Cheddar cheese, thereby reducing the considerable <br>
cost of providing storage for the ripening process.  This <br>
ripening aid can be used in conjunction with calf rennet or any <br>
rennet substitute, although those of animal origin are preferred.<br>

                            Researchers at Memorial University of Newfoundland, have <br>
conducted research on a biological control agent specifically for <br>
spruce budworm and hemlock looper and have identified a <br>
naturally-occurring fungus that uses these pests&#39; larval stage as <br>
its host.  The researches have developed a growing median for the <br>
biological reactor to produce the fungus, while having it remain <br>
virulent to spruce budworm and hemlock looper.  The concept of <br>
the use of this fungus is to dope the forest with hyphal bodies <br>
to the fungus early in the insect infestation and enhance the <br>
natural process, thereby strictly limiting the magnitude of the <br>
infestation.  This product would be a market for this technology <br>
include the provincial departments and organizations that are <br>
charged with the responsibility of forest pest control.<br>

                            A new strain of carotenoid yeast has been isolated from yoghourt <br>
which shows promise a sa source for pigment and protein feed for <br>
aquacultured species.  The new yeast was able to utilize a wide <br>
variety of organic nitrogen sources such as molasses and grew in <br>
a wide pH range (pH3-10).  When compared with Phaffia rhodozyma, <br>
the carotenoid yeast grew much faster attaining a much superior <br>
biomass yield. (g dry wt/L), and a greater concentration of <br>
pigment.  The new carotenoid yeast could replace the use of <br>
astaxanthin which is used primarily as a color supplement in fish <br>

                            Researches have developed an economic and practical delivery <br>
system for biological materials for use in aquaculture.  <br>
Entrapment of antigen into multi-lamellar vesicles (liposomes), <br>
has been demonstrated by MUN researches to enhance immune <br>
responses to the associated antigen.  The use of liposomes to <br>
encapsulate antigens can also adjuvant activity and potentially <br>
increase immune responses to antigens delivered via any route.  <br>
The liposomal delivery system technology can be designed to <br>
package and deliver vaccines, antibodies, vitamins and minerals, <br>
viruses and any other components requiring packaging.  This <br>
technology could improve fish quality and quantity by reducing <br>
fish disease in fish husbandry.<br>

                            Fish Feeding regimes and strategies for controlling the onset or <br>
delay of reproduction in aquaculture subjects, preferable by <br>
using cheap, naturally occurring or slightly modified food <br>
components is under investigation.  Several hey biochemical <br>
factors have been identified as being the key to manipulating <br>
reproduction in fish.  The manipulation of reproduction in other <br>
fish is being studied using the same biochemical factors.  The <br>
critical periods for when to add these biochemical factors to the <br>
feed regimes is under investigation.  The possibility that <br>
feeding can be manipulated to ``turn-off`` fish reproduction <br>
means that energy can be directed to muscle (flesh) quality <br>
rather than reproduction.  The nutritional control of fish <br>
reproduction is reversible so that fish which shoe good growth <br>
characteristics after ``turn-off`` can be subsequently used as <br>
brood stock.<br>

                            The invention pertains to the use of a TRANSPORT PROTEIN used to <br>
transport and load molecules (diagnostic and pharmaceutical <br>
agents) into lipoprotein particles (LDL, VLDL, HDL) which <br>
subsequently have use as a delivery system.  One advantage of <br>
this system is that a larger amount of an ``agent`` can be loaded <br>
into a lipoprotein particle without destabilizing the delivery <br>
system and allows the system to retain the natural biological <br>
appearance of the human LDL particle.  Lipoprotein meets most of <br>
the requirements for a satisfactory drug carrier :<br>
-	they are endogenous and can avoid such typical carrier <br>
        problems as immunological reaction and rapid plasma <br>
        clearance due to uptake by reticuloendothelial cells;<br>
-	receptor-mediated endocytosis enables intracellular <br>
        uptake of the drug in specific tissues;<br>
-	lipoprotein particles are totally biodegradable;<br>
-	they provide a biocompatible vehicle for lipophilic <br>
        drugs.  This is of special importance if the drug is <br>
        prone to decomposition.<br>
<br>
The improved particles have application towards :<br>
1)development of novel anticancer therapy;<br>
2)development of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for early   <br>
detection of atherosclerosis<br>
3)development of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals for detection of <br>
  tumors;<br>
4)development of specific anti-HIV drug therapy;<br>
5)potential development of specific delivery vehicles for gene   <br>
therapy<br>
6)cosmetic applications.<br>

                            The present invention relates to a novel family of immediate <br>
early response genes discovered during embryonic development.  <br>
This family of mammalian genes are transcribed in the immediate <br>
early phase following exposure to FGF during mesoderm induction, <br>
termed Mesoderm Induction Early Response (MIER) genes.  One <br>
member of this mammalian family of genes, the Er1 gene, has been <br>
found over-expressed in breast carcinoma and cervical carcinoma <br>
cell lines.  Er1 is also over expressed in an abnormal T-cell <br>
subset (CD28-) whose numbers increase with disease progression in <br>
AIDS patients.  This CD28- subset also increases in chronic <br>
inflammatory disorders.  Therefore this gene and its product are <br>
potential targets for diagnosis and treatment of various cancers <br>
as well as immune disorders such as AIDS.  This family of genes <br>
could have many uses in Cancer and AIDS diagnostic and <br>
therapeutic applications such as : use in drug design, <br>
vaccination protocols, diagnostic markers for rapidly <br>
proliferating cells, diagnostic kits containing antibodies<br>
to the gene product of any one of the gene members, use as <br>
primers in PCR amplification for R&amp;D purposes, screening <br>
assays, etc.<br>

                            Terra Nova Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (TNB) is a privately-held <br>
company based in St. John&#39;s, Newfoundland, Canada since 1988.  <br>
TNB uses its expertise in immunology and molecular biology to <br>
develop, produce, and market monoclonal antibodies for in-vitro <br>
diagnostic use.  TNB is producing a set of monoclonal antibodies, <br>
in kit form, against the polymorphism of HLA-DP that will allow <br>
tissue typing to be done by serological methods.  This will play <br>
a crucial role in matching bone marrow transplant (BMT) <br>
donors/recipients.  TNB&#39;s recent research into the Human <br>
Leucocyte Antigen, HLA-DR4, has resulted in production of <br>
monoclonal antibodies capable of recognizing the specific subsets <br>
of the HLA system that are associated with an individual&#39;s <br>
susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.  Since May 1995, the <br>
company has been marketing the NovaPRO test kit which has <br>
potential to play a key role in both the diagnosis and prognosis <br>
of rheumatoid arthritis patients.  In addition, the company <br>
undertakes genetic testing in cases of disputed paternity.  TNB <br>
also offers specialized services related to production and <br>
research such as contract mAb manufacturing and investigative R&amp;D <br>
for its customers.<br>

                            PA Pure Additions Inc., through its extensive research, has <br>
developed a powdered cooked-cured-n\meat pigment which is <br>
identical to the natural pink-colored pigment found in nitrite <br>
cured-meat.  This pigment , in combination with a sequestrant, an <br>
antioxidant and an antimicrobial agent for meat curing, has been <br>
found very effective in reproducing the color, oxidative <br>
stability and flavor, as well as the antimicrobial effects of <br>
nitrite.  The pigment combination has been applied to both solid <br>
and emulsified meat products, tested and found effective.  The <br>
sensory acceptability of this nitrite alternative has been tested <br>
through the use of blind taste-tests, with excellent results.<br>

                            The AQUALERT emits an acoustic warning signal which can be detected by whales, porpoises and dolphins at ranges exceeding 1 km, alerting them to the presence of the fishing gear and allowing them to avoid becoming entrapped.  Field tests of the AQUALERT have been conducted off the coast of New Hampshire, USA, on groundfish gillnets, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada on cod traps, and in waters off Queensland, Australia on shark gillnets.  The results showed significant reductions in the by-catch of humpback whales.<br>
<br>
The Government of Queensland was very impressed with the AQUALERT during the test<br>
program and has purchased 75 units for the continued prevention of whale entrapment.<br>
Preliminary testing of these units on groundfish gillnets has indicated promising results in<br>
reduction of harbour porpoise by-catch.<br>
<br>
The AQUALERT attaches easily to fishing gear and emits a consistent, loud acoustic warning signal which emanates in all directions at an interval which can be set to 3, 6, or 10 seconds.  The signal is well within the audible frequency range of marine mammals and can be detected at ranges of 1 km or more.  Range will vary depending on species and ambient noise levels. <br>

                            The Biology Dept. At Memorial University of Newfoundland has been conducting research in a control agent for spruce budworm/hemlock looper and has identified a naturally occurring fungus that uses these pests&#39; larval stages as its hosts, and is probably a major factor in the natural collapse of the pest population. A growing medium Patent (pending) has been developed for use in a biological reactor to produce the fungus, while having it remain virulent to spruce budworm and hemlock looper!<br>
<br>
The concept of the use of this fungus is to dope the forest with hyphal bodies of the fungus early in the insect infestation, and enhance the natural process, thereby strictly limiting the magnitude of infestation. The fungus has been produced in 10 L scale fermenters, and has been tested and found effective in Forestry Canada&#39;s greenhouses.  A U.S. patent has been issued and a Canadian patent is pending.<br>

                            Bio-ID Corporation Limited was formed in 1990 to develop and <br>
promote a novel procedure referred to as Forensically Informative <br>
Nucleotide Sequencing (FINS).  This process can determine the <br>
biological origin of a specimen (i.e. the species or breed of <br>
animal from which the sample came).  Unlike conventional methods <br>
of specie identification, which usually depend on morphological <br>
characteristics of biochemical genetics which usually depend on <br>
morphological characteristics of biochemical genetics which <br>
examine proteins, FINS makes use of DNA - the molecule that <br>
contains the genetic information.  A species&#39; DNA consists of <br>
segments that are (1) unique to individuals, (2) shared by breeds <br>
or populations, (3) found in all members of that species, and (4) <br>
common in related species.  FINS combines procedures in <br>
biotechnology with a data base that is under constant <br>
construction.<br>
