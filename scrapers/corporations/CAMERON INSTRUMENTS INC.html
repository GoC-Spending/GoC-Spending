                            Piston Sensors for Liquids:  High-Pressure<br>
<br>
A spring-loaded piston/magnet sensor is magnetically coupled to a pointer to indicate a pressure difference.  Sensing is completely separated from the indicator, switches, relay or transmitter.  A high pressure rated housing is machined from a single block making these a natural for high pressure applications.  Includes the 1201, 1203 &amp; 1303 series.<br>
Diaphragm Sensor for Gases &amp; Liquids<br>
<br>
For air or gas applications and no bypass, consider the diaphragm sensor design.  Built on a design similar to the piston units, a diaphragm replaces the piston and separates the high and low pressure ports.  A variety of diaphragm designs are available; small for more common DP measurements, large for more sensitive applications and a rolling diaphragm for high DP measurements.  The gauges can be accompanied by a switch, relay or transmitter.  Includes the 1502, 1516, 1518 &amp; 1831 series.<br>
Hazardous Location Models<br>
<br>
Switches, relays and transmitters are enclosed in UL, CSA, FM and CENELEC approved enclosures that have a gauge option for local indication.  Choose one or two switches, SPST, SPDT or a DPDT relay, available in a variety of voltages.  Transmitters allow for continuous remote location monitoring.  These enclosures meet Class I, Div. I specifications along with Nema-3, 4X, 7, 9 and 12.  Both piston and diaphragm sensor models are available to make this the most comprehensive offering in the industry.  Includes the 1204, 1504 &amp; 1514 series.<br>

                            Biological processes generate gas compositions that make special demands on measuring equipment.  The robust Multitec 540 provides the ability to measure six gases simultaneously.  The use of infrared measuring techniques for methane and carbon dioxide means that there is no possibility of misleading results due to interaction with other gases.  This makes it ideal for use in waste disposal sites, sewage plants and biogas plants.  A large display allows all parameters to be displayed simultaneously and quickly read from a single screen.  Measurement data is stored in log files and can be transferred without difficulty to a PC over the USB link.<br>

                            Quick test fittings from Ralston Instruments provide a convenient method of connecting Ralston Pumps and micro bore hoses to your pressure calibrators, test gauges and to the instrument under test.  Connections that use the Ralston knurled probe nut are finger tight.  Quick-test hose and adapters seal via an O-ring and probe.  The probe slides into the O-ring and provides the seal while the threads keep the probe in place.  This simple and reliable method allows for leak-free connections in any calibration.  FIttings are available up to 10,000psi and most are available in both 316 SS and brass.<br>

CPF Fittings and Hoses are a new line of quick-test pressure fittings for calibration and test applications - designed with an emphasis on safety.  Crystal Pressure Fittings (CPF) perform up to 10 000 psi/1000 bar, and feature a safety weep hole to alert you before you accidentally disconnect from a pressurized system.  It can also be used as a bleed point.<br>
<br>
Each fitting is machined in 316 Stainless Steel and laser markings indicate the fitting type, size, part number, and Maximum Allowable Working Pressure to prevent a mismatched connection.<br>
<br>
An industry-first patented o-ring connection allows CPF Fittings to maintain a leak-free seal up to 10 000 psi with only finger-tightening.  This offers an alternative to commonly-used NPT Fittings, which require technicians to wrap their fittings in thread tape and use a wrench to tighten each installation.  Unlike other quick-change fittings, the o-rings in CPF Fittings are also easily replaceable.<br>

                            The molbloc/molbox gas flow calibration system from Fluke’s DH Instruments Division<br>
<br>
uses laminar flow element and sonic nozzle technology to deliver fast, repeatable calibrations in the range of less than 1 sccm to over 5,000 slm. Customers can choose from two different measurement terminals and multiple flow element ranges and calibration options to allow measurements with uncertainty as low as ±0.125% of reading in several gases. Measurements are traceable through DHI’s GFS2102 primary gravimetric flow system.<br>
<br>
All molbloc elements allow precise real-time readings to enable quick testing and easy adjustment of instruments under test. The system is ideal for testing mass flow meters and controllers, rotameters and other gas flow devices. Many calibrations can be fully automated and adjustments for the effect of varying ambient conditions on these devices can be automatically performed using COMPASS for Flow software.  <br>

                            The Model 2482 is a high precision standard that provides unsurpassed performance in the field of differential pressure metrology at high static line pressures. Designed to calibrate virtually any differential pressure sensing device, the 2482 combines exceptional accuracy along with speed and ease of use. Featuring a triple-axis piston assembly this primary standard provides both pneumatic and hydraulic differential pressure calibrations to 850 inH20 (2100 mbar) at line pressures up to 2900 psi (200 bar).<br>
<br>
A precision load cell supports the differential piston assembly and serves to quickly and accurately zero the standard at elevated line pressures. Until now, this has been a time consuming and technique dependent process. Supplied with Windows based menu driven software to control the piston gauge and provide the full range of corrections and calculations, the 2482 is the ideal standard for calibrating transmitters used in applications such as turbine efficiency testing and custody transfer measurements.<br>

                            The advantage of Perma-Cal Direct Drive pressure gauges over conventional C-tube gauges is simple; only one moving part.  Perma-Cal gauges have a unique helical-wound element that is attached directly to the pointer shaft.  This eliminates the need for any movement-amplifying gears or linkages - the parts of a C tube gauge that fail most frequently.  Perma-Cal gauges maintain their structural integrity and accurate calibration in the most demanding environments, even during prolonged and rugged use.<br>

                            The MPC Model 202 sight flow indicator (SFI) is an inexpensive, compact device used to visually detect flow, color, and relative movement of liquid. A few of the most common applications for the SFI include the monitoring of cooling water to welding and die casting machines.<br>
<br>
This low-cost indicator uses the flow of liquid to agitate multi-colored balls in a clear Lexan® dome. The solid brass alloy body is designed to be easily installed in the pipe line or to be panel mounted for observing multi-line applications. The MPC SFI operates in all planes and positions, vertical and horizontal, providing visibility from virtually any angle.<br>

                            Piston Sensors for Liquids:  High-Pressure<br>
<br>
A spring-loaded piston/magnet sensor is magnetically coupled to a pointer to indicate a pressure difference.  Sensing is completely separated from the indicator, switches, relay or transmitter.  A high pressure rated housing is machined from a single block making these a natural for high pressure applications.  Includes the 1201, 1203 &amp; 1303 series.<br>
Diaphragm Sensor for Gases &amp; Liquids<br>
<br>
For air or gas applications and no bypass, consider the diaphragm sensor design.  Built on a design similar to the piston units, a diaphragm replaces the piston and separates the high and low pressure ports.  A variety of diaphragm designs are available; small for more common DP measurements, large for more sensitive applications and a rolling diaphragm for high DP measurements.  The gauges can be accompanied by a switch, relay or transmitter.  Includes the 1502, 1516, 1518 &amp; 1831 series.<br>
Hazardous Location Models<br>
<br>
Switches, relays and transmitters are enclosed in UL, CSA, FM and CENELEC approved enclosures that have a gauge option for local indication.  Choose one or two switches, SPST, SPDT or a DPDT relay, available in a variety of voltages.  Transmitters allow for continuous remote location monitoring.  These enclosures meet Class I, Div. I specifications along with Nema-3, 4X, 7, 9 and 12.  Both piston and diaphragm sensor models are available to make this the most comprehensive offering in the industry.  Includes the 1204, 1504 &amp; 1514 series.<br>

                            Biological processes generate gas compositions that make special demands on measuring equipment.  The robust Multitec 540 provides the ability to measure six gases simultaneously.  The use of infrared measuring techniques for methane and carbon dioxide means that there is no possibility of misleading results due to interaction with other gases.  This makes it ideal for use in waste disposal sites, sewage plants and biogas plants.  A large display allows all parameters to be displayed simultaneously and quickly read from a single screen.  Measurement data is stored in log files and can be transferred without difficulty to a PC over the USB link.<br>

                            Quick test fittings from Ralston Instruments provide a convenient method of connecting Ralston Pumps and micro bore hoses to your pressure calibrators, test gauges and to the instrument under test.  Connections that use the Ralston knurled probe nut are finger tight.  Quick-test hose and adapters seal via an O-ring and probe.  The probe slides into the O-ring and provides the seal while the threads keep the probe in place.  This simple and reliable method allows for leak-free connections in any calibration.  FIttings are available up to 10,000psi and most are available in both 316 SS and brass.<br>

CPF Fittings and Hoses are a new line of quick-test pressure fittings for calibration and test applications - designed with an emphasis on safety.  Crystal Pressure Fittings (CPF) perform up to 10 000 psi/1000 bar, and feature a safety weep hole to alert you before you accidentally disconnect from a pressurized system.  It can also be used as a bleed point.<br>
<br>
Each fitting is machined in 316 Stainless Steel and laser markings indicate the fitting type, size, part number, and Maximum Allowable Working Pressure to prevent a mismatched connection.<br>
<br>
An industry-first patented o-ring connection allows CPF Fittings to maintain a leak-free seal up to 10 000 psi with only finger-tightening.  This offers an alternative to commonly-used NPT Fittings, which require technicians to wrap their fittings in thread tape and use a wrench to tighten each installation.  Unlike other quick-change fittings, the o-rings in CPF Fittings are also easily replaceable.<br>

                            The molbloc/molbox gas flow calibration system from Fluke’s DH Instruments Division<br>
<br>
uses laminar flow element and sonic nozzle technology to deliver fast, repeatable calibrations in the range of less than 1 sccm to over 5,000 slm. Customers can choose from two different measurement terminals and multiple flow element ranges and calibration options to allow measurements with uncertainty as low as ±0.125% of reading in several gases. Measurements are traceable through DHI’s GFS2102 primary gravimetric flow system.<br>
<br>
All molbloc elements allow precise real-time readings to enable quick testing and easy adjustment of instruments under test. The system is ideal for testing mass flow meters and controllers, rotameters and other gas flow devices. Many calibrations can be fully automated and adjustments for the effect of varying ambient conditions on these devices can be automatically performed using COMPASS for Flow software.  <br>

                            The advantage of Perma-Cal Direct Drive pressure gauges over conventional C-tube gauges is simple; only one moving part.  Perma-Cal gauges have a unique helical-wound element that is attached directly to the pointer shaft.  This eliminates the need for any movement-amplifying gears or linkages - the parts of a C tube gauge that fail most frequently.  Perma-Cal gauges maintain their structural integrity and accurate calibration in the most demanding environments, even during prolonged and rugged use.<br>

                            The MPC Model 202 sight flow indicator (SFI) is an inexpensive, compact device used to visually detect flow, color, and relative movement of liquid. A few of the most common applications for the SFI include the monitoring of cooling water to welding and die casting machines.<br>
<br>
This low-cost indicator uses the flow of liquid to agitate multi-colored balls in a clear Lexan® dome. The solid brass alloy body is designed to be easily installed in the pipe line or to be panel mounted for observing multi-line applications. The MPC SFI operates in all planes and positions, vertical and horizontal, providing visibility from virtually any angle.<br>
