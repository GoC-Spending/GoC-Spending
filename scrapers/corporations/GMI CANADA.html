        <br>            Our core principles have worked in manufacturing, retail, software development, and telecommunications. They understand what it takes to run a business, what affects business and the need to be efficient and take opportunities when they are offered.  <br>Our end users have worked with software developers to develop a practical software  that is adaptable to many industries. <br> GMI Canada has a strong core that combines technical abilities with strong management roles (financial, cost accounting, cash management, quality, efficiencies, cost reductions, HR, Health &amp; Safety, program development, system development etc.,). Due to the economic need to initiate programs that identify weak or problem areas; we have developed projects to improve quality, efficiencies and/or cost reductions for many industries. GMI transcended into designing software that would utilize tablets in industries that had legislative, industry, and or internal requirements for reporting. <br>We have international business experience in both large and small business.<br>We have a strong background in internal controls, developing and training adult personnel, record keeping, policies and procedures, system development. Our team has outstanding abilities to identify problems and provide effective solutions.<br><br>

                            We are a small company that has designed and are in the final phases of programming a software application that would be valuable to your company.  Our software solves due diligent issues for managers and director, however it is much more than that. It is a method to keep your employees safe and informed. It is customizable to your business/industry.<br>
Let your staff do value added work! Work smarter!<br>
Our software can be web or tablet based (recommended) and will help reduce workload and provide better reporting.<br>
This software app, will streamline work, and allow managers to work on value added projects. It will reduce work, provide better information, provide a system for capturing information critical to the operations, and drive the information to those who need it.<br>
<br>
Within the next few years many valuable key personnel will be retiring, are you ready for them to leave? Our software will help you get there and improve the process.<br>
We have developed a new software application for Health &amp; Safety, policy and procedures, checklists, ISO, training, communication, etc. The software can interface with other software or as a standalone package. The software can provide ROI through efficiencies in time, quality, education, communication, loss of time due to accidents and savings in administration tasks. It provides information directly to those who need it. It can provide strong documentation for due diligence as well as raw data for analytical analysis. We maximize current technology so that it can be used in all industries.<br>
Our training module essentially operates without intervention after the initial setup, unless;<br>
	changes are required due to legislation <br>
	capital asset additions <br>
	change of content <br>
	employee changes<br>
Our Software was designed by END users collaborating with SOFTWARE developers. <br>
The software can be used as a web based application, or with tablets. If used with tablets (recommended) the knowledge base remains with the tablet and syncs when within range. <br>
Are you using your information to the best of it capabilities?	<br>
<br>
Our company is comprised of financial controllers, adult trainers, efficiency specialist (lean, ISO, team concept, etc.) health and safety specialists and software developers.<br>
Our application is a web base product that uses tablets as an added value tool. Our software will save time and money, improve quality, ensure employee participation, safe guard employees and the companys assets. It will capture the knowledge and best practices and place it into the hands of the individual who needs it. The process will;<br>
 Develop or update current SOPs, best practices, policy and procedures and map it to relevant tasks. For example an employee will be able to access the SOP or training module from the equipment, or the task, or an employee can access the training module from the SOP.<br>
 Develop new web and tablet based training (we can create new information or use existing information to develop the web based training modules) this training will be mapped to relevant tasks.<br>
 Ensure that employees provide detailed information by each task; this will ensure that the knowledge base is complete.<br>
Employees, managers, supervisors, HR etc., will sign off on all completed tasks. Trials will be done to ensure accuracy of the process.<br>
<br>
We will help your Company ensure that the knowledge from your leaders and skilled workforce is captured and tested. This will ensure that the knowledge remains with the company if an employee leaves, retires, is involved in an accidents etc.<br>
<br>
 If we can make checklists easier to do, they will get done.<br>
 If SOPs and procedures are available at our finger tips, they will be followed more consistently.<br>
 If training is available to us 24/7, we can take it when we want to.<br>
 If training is available 24/7, we can choose to take additional training to upgrade our skills for advancement.<br>
 If there is a procedure that is only completed once every 6 months, we can access it to familiarize ourselves with it before attempting the procedure. This could keep us safe; this could keep the equipment from being damaged.<br>
Each industry has reporting requirements, some are clearly defined (ISO) and others are vague, and require the employer to show compliance based on documentation of regular audits and reporting.<br>
Our software package IMC, will address the key measurements required to meet regulatory requirements by using an application we have developed to be used on tablets. Although the intelligence remains on the tablet, it can send and receive information to a server for reporting and distributions. Depending on the companys IT infrastructure, information could be used to create work orders, notify managers of critical issues via reporting or e-mail notification.<br>
For example the Ontario Health &amp; Safety Act (OHSA) requires that employers show due diligence. This is done by having written, up to date, understandable policies and procedures for all hazardous activities at the workplace. These policy and procedures need to be updated as equipment, workplace practices, OHSA requirements or standards evolve.<br>
Our software would allow a company to develop checklists that could include:<br>
 The ability to build customizable check lists<br>
 Information sections provide help pertaining to the question as well as linking to the Companies Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs)<br>
 The ability to attach a picture or document of the non-compliant item<br>
 The ability to include a QR scan<br>
 Checklist completion would be based on the requirement; shift change, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. These checklists could provide documentation of routine inspections, notification, and companies SOPs as well as procedures.<br>
 Distribution of non-compliant or Opportunity for Improvement (OFI) would be based on the Companys requirement, i.e... E-mail distribution, H&amp;S to the H&amp;S Manager, repair and maintenance to the Maintenance Manager, etc. Reports would be developed based on the Companys requirement. Ongoing communication/coordination/ reporting of issues or tasks required would be addressed through either reports or e-mail. This would ensure communicating of issues with equipment and or work conditions. This notification is crucial to identify and remind all of risks and hazards, and help establish due diligence.<br>
Notes, records, and documents in support of company SOPs, policy and procedures is essential (i.e.... training records with agendas, checklist, tests retained, signed off on rules, procedures; audits and assessments of hazards and recorded; written training plan/training matrix; documentation of dates/content; documented communications, etc.) all support whether or not a company can prove they met the rules of due diligence (due diligence can only be determined by the courts).<br>
Our software will help Companies become compliant with their regulatory obligations. If checklists are not completed, emails can be sent to managers for further follow up. Since the time and date is captured from the system, employees must complete them on schedule to avoid an electronic notification to their supervisor or H&amp;S officer. This is all completed and stored electronically, with the ability to be recalled at a later date.<br>
Additional applications are; <br>
<br>
 Employee training, testing, tracking  notifications to HR and employees<br>
 ISO checklist and audits<br>
 Computer-aided Lean Management (CALM) <br>
 Forms  Hazard assessments, hospital forms, lab forms, quality checks and assessments, etc.<br>
<br>
What is the software commercialization application? Its almost limitless.<br>
<br>
 Software application developed for all industries that require document processes<br>
 Application can be used by any size of company from a Sole Proprietor with a tablet to a large Corporation with multiple servers and locations<br>
 Reduce noncompliance fines and penalties<br>
 Reduce legal and court cost for failing to help show due diligence. Avoid astounding high corporate OH&amp;S penalties for high risk issues  even where no accident occurs. Penalties are intended to hit hard and represent more than a slap on the wrist<br>
 Training tools and training programs are developed and tracked<br>
 Added value product for quality programs such as Lean programs<br>
 Remain ISO compliant  remain being able to supply contracts that require ISO certification<br>
 Hazard assessment  trades going to new sites, new procedures, new setups<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ISO certifications - we have specialists for various ISO programs<br>
There are in excess of 900,000 organizations registered (or &#39;certified&#39;) to ISO Standards. The bulk of the registrations (over 80%) are ISO 9001:2008<br>
 ISO 9001 (Quality Management System Requirements) requires that an organization carry out Internal Audits (ISO 9001:2008 clause 8.2.2) &#39;&quot;at planned intervals to determine whether the quality management system conforms to planned arrangements&quot; and other criteria. More Internal Audits provide more value to the Organization<br>
 ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System Requirements) requires that an organization do 2 kinds of audits. The first kind is stated in clause 4.5.2 of ISO 14001:2004. This clause requires a &#39;compliance&#39; audit &quot;for evaluating compliance with applicable legal requirements&quot;. In addition, clause 4.5.5 mimics the ISO 9001:2008 requirements for Internal Audits<br>
 OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Auditing Standard) has the same requirements as ISO 14001<br>
 There are a number of ISO standards built on ISO 9001: TS 16949 (Automotive), TL 9000 (Telecommunications), AS 9100 (Aerospace) and others. They all have the same or more stringent requirements<br>
 Examples of other ISO standards requiring Internal Audits are: ISO 13485, ISO 15189, ISO 17025<br>
 In all cases, Registrars (QMI/SAI, BSI, SGS and CGSB) report that one of the top 3 areas of non-conformance for registered companies is the failure to carry out corrective actions.<br>
Our software would provide follow up notification; until the corrective issues were signed off (electronically) <br>
our software can be segregated by departments, employees, sectors, groups, and associations etc., whatever works for your company.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
This application has great potential for many industries. Every company struggles with checklists regardless of the size. However, as we can see with the enforcement aspect, these checklists must be completed in a manner that is:<br>
	Simple and easy to use <br>
	Information pertaining to the question, company SOPs etc. can be added to the database <br>
	Failure to complete a checklist will notify the responsible manager <br>
	Documentation can be used to established a routine of completing checklists <br>
	Easy to notify the appropriate departments with e-mail and reporting distributions <br>
Checklists can be implemented into the environment and become a useful tool rather than something to just get done. It can be integrated into other systems, it can capture data to be used as an analytical tool, and it can grow well beyond a simple check list. The system has the capabilities and flexibility to grow into a customized system that is useful to everyone.<br>
Our application is so much more than a checklist, it can change and improve efficiencies, communication and reporting requirements, it can be a tool that provides knowledge at any hour of the day or night. It removes administration cost.<br>

                            We are a small company that has designed and are in the final phases of programming a software application that would be valuable to your company.  Our software solves due diligent issues for managers and director, however it is much more than that. It is a method to keep your employees safe and informed. It is customizable to your business/industry.<br>
Let your staff do value added work! Work smarter!<br>
Our software can be web or tablet based (recommended) and will help reduce workload and provide better reporting.<br>
This software app, will streamline work, and allow managers to work on value added projects. It will reduce work, provide better information, provide a system for capturing information critical to the operations, and drive the information to those who need it.<br>
<br>
Within the next few years many valuable key personnel will be retiring, are you ready for them to leave? Our software will help you get there and improve the process.<br>
We have developed a new software application for Health &amp; Safety, policy and procedures, checklists, ISO, training, communication, etc. The software can interface with other software or as a standalone package. The software can provide ROI through efficiencies in time, quality, education, communication, loss of time due to accidents and savings in administration tasks. It provides information directly to those who need it. It can provide strong documentation for due diligence as well as raw data for analytical analysis. We maximize current technology so that it can be used in all industries.<br>
Our training module essentially operates without intervention after the initial setup, unless;<br>
	changes are required due to legislation <br>
	capital asset additions <br>
	change of content <br>
	employee changes<br>
Our Software was designed by END users collaborating with SOFTWARE developers. <br>
The software can be used as a web based application, or with tablets. If used with tablets (recommended) the knowledge base remains with the tablet and syncs when within range. <br>
Are you using your information to the best of it capabilities?	<br>
<br>
Our company is comprised of financial controllers, adult trainers, efficiency specialist (lean, ISO, team concept, etc.) health and safety specialists and software developers.<br>
Our application is a web base product that uses tablets as an added value tool. Our software will save time and money, improve quality, ensure employee participation, safe guard employees and the companys assets. It will capture the knowledge and best practices and place it into the hands of the individual who needs it. The process will;<br>
 Develop or update current SOPs, best practices, policy and procedures and map it to relevant tasks. For example an employee will be able to access the SOP or training module from the equipment, or the task, or an employee can access the training module from the SOP.<br>
 Develop new web and tablet based training (we can create new information or use existing information to develop the web based training modules) this training will be mapped to relevant tasks.<br>
 Ensure that employees provide detailed information by each task; this will ensure that the knowledge base is complete.<br>
Employees, managers, supervisors, HR etc., will sign off on all completed tasks. Trials will be done to ensure accuracy of the process.<br>
<br>
We will help your Company ensure that the knowledge from your leaders and skilled workforce is captured and tested. This will ensure that the knowledge remains with the company if an employee leaves, retires, is involved in an accidents etc.<br>
<br>
 If we can make checklists easier to do, they will get done.<br>
 If SOPs and procedures are available at our finger tips, they will be followed more consistently.<br>
 If training is available to us 24/7, we can take it when we want to.<br>
 If training is available 24/7, we can choose to take additional training to upgrade our skills for advancement.<br>
 If there is a procedure that is only completed once every 6 months, we can access it to familiarize ourselves with it before attempting the procedure. This could keep us safe; this could keep the equipment from being damaged.<br>
Each industry has reporting requirements, some are clearly defined (ISO) and others are vague, and require the employer to show compliance based on documentation of regular audits and reporting.<br>
Our software package IMC, will address the key measurements required to meet regulatory requirements by using an application we have developed to be used on tablets. Although the intelligence remains on the tablet, it can send and receive information to a server for reporting and distributions. Depending on the companys IT infrastructure, information could be used to create work orders, notify managers of critical issues via reporting or e-mail notification.<br>
For example the Ontario Health &amp; Safety Act (OHSA) requires that employers show due diligence. This is done by having written, up to date, understandable policies and procedures for all hazardous activities at the workplace. These policy and procedures need to be updated as equipment, workplace practices, OHSA requirements or standards evolve.<br>
Our software would allow a company to develop checklists that could include:<br>
 The ability to build customizable check lists<br>
 Information sections provide help pertaining to the question as well as linking to the Companies Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs)<br>
 The ability to attach a picture or document of the non-compliant item<br>
 The ability to include a QR scan<br>
 Checklist completion would be based on the requirement; shift change, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. These checklists could provide documentation of routine inspections, notification, and companies SOPs as well as procedures.<br>
 Distribution of non-compliant or Opportunity for Improvement (OFI) would be based on the Companys requirement, i.e... E-mail distribution, H&amp;S to the H&amp;S Manager, repair and maintenance to the Maintenance Manager, etc. Reports would be developed based on the Companys requirement. Ongoing communication/coordination/ reporting of issues or tasks required would be addressed through either reports or e-mail. This would ensure communicating of issues with equipment and or work conditions. This notification is crucial to identify and remind all of risks and hazards, and help establish due diligence.<br>
Notes, records, and documents in support of company SOPs, policy and procedures is essential (i.e.... training records with agendas, checklist, tests retained, signed off on rules, procedures; audits and assessments of hazards and recorded; written training plan/training matrix; documentation of dates/content; documented communications, etc.) all support whether or not a company can prove they met the rules of due diligence (due diligence can only be determined by the courts).<br>
Our software will help Companies become compliant with their regulatory obligations. If checklists are not completed, emails can be sent to managers for further follow up. Since the time and date is captured from the system, employees must complete them on schedule to avoid an electronic notification to their supervisor or H&amp;S officer. This is all completed and stored electronically, with the ability to be recalled at a later date.<br>
Additional applications are; <br>
<br>
 Employee training, testing, tracking  notifications to HR and employees<br>
 ISO checklist and audits<br>
 Computer-aided Lean Management (CALM) <br>
 Forms  Hazard assessments, hospital forms, lab forms, quality checks and assessments, etc.<br>
<br>
What is the software commercialization application? Its almost limitless.<br>
<br>
 Software application developed for all industries that require document processes<br>
 Application can be used by any size of company from a Sole Proprietor with a tablet to a large Corporation with multiple servers and locations<br>
 Reduce noncompliance fines and penalties<br>
 Reduce legal and court cost for failing to help show due diligence. Avoid astounding high corporate OH&amp;S penalties for high risk issues  even where no accident occurs. Penalties are intended to hit hard and represent more than a slap on the wrist<br>
 Training tools and training programs are developed and tracked<br>
 Added value product for quality programs such as Lean programs<br>
 Remain ISO compliant  remain being able to supply contracts that require ISO certification<br>
 Hazard assessment  trades going to new sites, new procedures, new setups<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ISO certifications - we have specialists for various ISO programs<br>
There are in excess of 900,000 organizations registered (or &#39;certified&#39;) to ISO Standards. The bulk of the registrations (over 80%) are ISO 9001:2008<br>
 ISO 9001 (Quality Management System Requirements) requires that an organization carry out Internal Audits (ISO 9001:2008 clause 8.2.2) &#39;&quot;at planned intervals to determine whether the quality management system conforms to planned arrangements&quot; and other criteria. More Internal Audits provide more value to the Organization<br>
 ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System Requirements) requires that an organization do 2 kinds of audits. The first kind is stated in clause 4.5.2 of ISO 14001:2004. This clause requires a &#39;compliance&#39; audit &quot;for evaluating compliance with applicable legal requirements&quot;. In addition, clause 4.5.5 mimics the ISO 9001:2008 requirements for Internal Audits<br>
 OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Auditing Standard) has the same requirements as ISO 14001<br>
 There are a number of ISO standards built on ISO 9001: TS 16949 (Automotive), TL 9000 (Telecommunications), AS 9100 (Aerospace) and others. They all have the same or more stringent requirements<br>
 Examples of other ISO standards requiring Internal Audits are: ISO 13485, ISO 15189, ISO 17025<br>
 In all cases, Registrars (QMI/SAI, BSI, SGS and CGSB) report that one of the top 3 areas of non-conformance for registered companies is the failure to carry out corrective actions.<br>
Our software would provide follow up notification; until the corrective issues were signed off (electronically) <br>
our software can be segregated by departments, employees, sectors, groups, and associations etc., whatever works for your company.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
This application has great potential for many industries. Every company struggles with checklists regardless of the size. However, as we can see with the enforcement aspect, these checklists must be completed in a manner that is:<br>
	Simple and easy to use <br>
	Information pertaining to the question, company SOPs etc. can be added to the database <br>
	Failure to complete a checklist will notify the responsible manager <br>
	Documentation can be used to established a routine of completing checklists <br>
	Easy to notify the appropriate departments with e-mail and reporting distributions <br>
Checklists can be implemented into the environment and become a useful tool rather than something to just get done. It can be integrated into other systems, it can capture data to be used as an analytical tool, and it can grow well beyond a simple check list. The system has the capabilities and flexibility to grow into a customized system that is useful to everyone.<br>
Our application is so much more than a checklist, it can change and improve efficiencies, communication and reporting requirements, it can be a tool that provides knowledge at any hour of the day or night. It removes administration cost.<br>
