                            DragonWave® Harmony Eband is the industry’s first 70/80 GHz, multipurpose platform designed to address both fronthaul and backhaul applications.  A compact, all-outdoor radio that delivers single carrier native 2.6 Gbps full-duplex capacity and up to 4 Gbps of compressed traffic. By utilizing large and generally untapped frequency bands, the Harmony Eband provides a cost-effective alternative to other, more congested (23 – 38 GHz), microwave frequencies for path distances up to 8 km.  System reach is industry leading with high output power, multiple-input/multiple output (MIMO) capability, and adaptive modulation and waveform techniques providing much greater reach than traditional Eband systems. Using an ultra-low delay mode and Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI), Harmony Eband is an ideal solution for high-capacity fronthaul applications.<br>
<br>
Solution Highlights:<br>
<br>
- Longest Reach E-Band System<br>
- High availability and reliability<br>

                Success stories:

              Clearwire is using microwave links and an all-IP network to enable high capacity backhaul for its award winning 4G mobile network spanning the United States.  Clearwires multi-year build-out is enabling advanced fixed digital voice &amp; high-speed mobile Internet service at speeds several times faster than 3G. <br>
Clearwire set out to pioneer the United States first nationwide 4G network  and it planned to do so at a much lower cost with much greater capacity than traditional cellular networks.  A key enabler of their strategy was the use of a cost effective backhaul solution that was simple to install and manage. Deploying fiber would have resulted in immense capital costs, while leased lines would have meant large monthly expenses, and in many cases would fail to deliver the capacity that Clearwire needed.  It became apparent that packet microwave was the backhaul solution of choice, offering an optimal combination of capacity, reliability and cost efficiency. <br>
Building a greenfield microwave backhaul network afforded Clearwire the flexibility to select packet microwave radios that met the following key requirements: Packet-based, all-IP solution to ensure greater efficiency and compatibility with next generation applications and services;  High capacity and scalability; Low latency supporting real-time applications including voice and video over IP;  Rapid deployment; Carrier-grade reliability utilizing Clearwires advanced ring architecture  <br>
An extensive assessment of packet microwave vendors led Clearwire to select DragonWave as one of its packet microwave radio suppliers.<br>

           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;In many parts of the United States, mobile services remain poor-in part because the backhaul connections linking rural cell towers deployed legacy technologies that were not designed to support today&#39;s advanced, broadband applications,&quot; said Robert Parsloe, Chief Executive Officer of Northeast Wireless Networks. &quot;The DragonWave solution effectively creates &#39;fiber in the sky&#39;, enabling us to offer our customers the most innovative, cost-efficient and secure broadband wireless services without incurring prohibitive operational and capital expenditures.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Execulink is pleased to extend access to high-speed Internet to the residents and businesses in Oxford County. With the help of DragonWave, we are able to provide a high-quality and affordable product to our consumers,&quot; said Jonathan E. Scott, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Operations with Execulink Telecom. &quot;After extensive evaluation and a public bid in which many solutions were considered, we chose the Horizon Compact because it allows us to offer the best Quality of Service (QoS) to our customers. Plus, its superior technical design translates into significant ongoing savings in operational expenditures (OPEX), and implementation is essentially seamless.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;Leasing costs are a major capital expense for system operators, carriers and enterprises that support their own microwave capability,&quot; said Richard Webb, Directing Analyst - Microwave for Infonetics Research. &quot;By integrating the modem and radio in the same robust outdoor system, DragonWave&#39;s Horizon Compact+ makes interior rack space available for other components and reduces rental expenditures.&quot;

<br>
- Reduced CAPEX because fewer links are required per node;  this results in as little as 25% of the CAPEX requirement at maximum capacity when compared to a path using 6 GHz – 42 GHz<br>
- Reduced OPEX as a result of low-cost spectrum, low energy consumption and a small form factor<br>
- Increased network scalability enabled by 4+Gbps system throughput<br>
- Greater reach than traditional Eband systems thanks to dual-mode MIMO with integrated high-gain antenna and hitless adaptive modulation<br>

              </h4>
           
              Clearwire is using microwave links and an all-IP network to enable high capacity backhaul for its award winning 4G mobile network spanning the United States.  Clearwires multi-year build-out is enabling advanced fixed digital voice &amp; high-speed mobile Internet service at speeds several times faster than 3G. <br>
Clearwire set out to pioneer the United States first nationwide 4G network  and it planned to do so at a much lower cost with much greater capacity than traditional cellular networks.  A key enabler of their strategy was the use of a cost effective backhaul solution that was simple to install and manage. Deploying fiber would have resulted in immense capital costs, while leased lines would have meant large monthly expenses, and in many cases would fail to deliver the capacity that Clearwire needed.  It became apparent that packet microwave was the backhaul solution of choice, offering an optimal combination of capacity, reliability and cost efficiency. <br>
Building a greenfield microwave backhaul network afforded Clearwire the flexibility to select packet microwave radios that met the following key requirements: Packet-based, all-IP solution to ensure greater efficiency and compatibility with next generation applications and services;  High capacity and scalability; Low latency supporting real-time applications including voice and video over IP;  Rapid deployment; Carrier-grade reliability utilizing Clearwires advanced ring architecture  <br>
An extensive assessment of packet microwave vendors led Clearwire to select DragonWave as one of its packet microwave radio suppliers.<br>

           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;In many parts of the United States, mobile services remain poor-in part because the backhaul connections linking rural cell towers deployed legacy technologies that were not designed to support today&#39;s advanced, broadband applications,&quot; said Robert Parsloe, Chief Executive Officer of Northeast Wireless Networks. &quot;The DragonWave solution effectively creates &#39;fiber in the sky&#39;, enabling us to offer our customers the most innovative, cost-efficient and secure broadband wireless services without incurring prohibitive operational and capital expenditures.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Execulink is pleased to extend access to high-speed Internet to the residents and businesses in Oxford County. With the help of DragonWave, we are able to provide a high-quality and affordable product to our consumers,&quot; said Jonathan E. Scott, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Operations with Execulink Telecom. &quot;After extensive evaluation and a public bid in which many solutions were considered, we chose the Horizon Compact because it allows us to offer the best Quality of Service (QoS) to our customers. Plus, its superior technical design translates into significant ongoing savings in operational expenditures (OPEX), and implementation is essentially seamless.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;Leasing costs are a major capital expense for system operators, carriers and enterprises that support their own microwave capability,&quot; said Richard Webb, Directing Analyst - Microwave for Infonetics Research. &quot;By integrating the modem and radio in the same robust outdoor system, DragonWave&#39;s Horizon Compact+ makes interior rack space available for other components and reduces rental expenditures.&quot;
