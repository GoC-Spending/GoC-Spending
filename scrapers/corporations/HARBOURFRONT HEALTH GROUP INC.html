              <h4>
                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              EXECUTIVE CONSULTANT, OSHAWA HEALTH CENTER<br>
<br>
Reporting directly to the primary shareholders of the governing Ontario corporation, relating internally to all practitioners and staff, externally to area community health stakeholders including Chief of Staff, Lakeridge Health Corporation, CEO Central LHIN, Queens University, Mayor of Oshawa and Chamber of Commerce, Durham Member of Parliament, local Members of Provincial Parliament and staff at MOHLTC.<br>
<br>
Opportunity: The Oshawa Health Centre required experienced healthcare executive guidance and leadership in fulfilling its ambitious vision to become a leading edge care centre for the region with integrated care expertise to be disseminated on a national basis.<br>
<br>
Actions: Current operating costs, balance sheet and cash flow reports were thoroughly analyzed for the transition into a facility four-fold the size of the previous centre.  Detailed financial plans were constructed with elaboration of current and future management and characteristics of debt/asset accumulation with corresponding operating costs and cash flows.  Financial resource objectives were implemented to ensure long term sustainability of the centre with a recruiting strategy for private health care services as well as practitioners to form a core group for the facilitys delivery of health care to the community.  The financial objectives developed were congruence with the overall vision of the centre to improve access for the community and develop best practices in multidisciplinary, integrated care. <br>
<br>
Resulting from our in-depth experience in the healthcare marketplace, optimal lease agreements were negotiated with service organizations to maximally benefit service to the community and impact revenue streams.  Compensation packages and benefits were formulated to create a competitive offering to the market and the recruiting strategy was successfully implemented in association with the Durham Chamber of Commerce.  Numerous detailed applications to the MOHLTC for public funding support were made through various envelopes identified as a result of research and ongoing relations with senior Ministry staff.  Integration of resources in a regional context was developed through consultation with senior hospital, LHIN, and political executives and staff.<br>
<br>
Administrative and support staff protocols were formed and documented to optimize human resource utility and satisfaction with standardized training programs.  Such documents were crucial in the equitable settlement of employee and union issues with administrative staff.  <br>
<br>
Annual reports to Revenue Canada were reviewed prior to Chartered Accountant preparation for submission to maximize compliance with legislation and reporting requirements.<br>
<br>
To develop shared vision and collaboration in a rapidly expanding professional and administrative staff, tenets of the Learning Organization (Senge, MIT, 1990) were adapted to multidisciplinary care giving rise to the Learning Model of Integrated Care (Ashton, Duffie, Aiken, 2007).  HFHG&#39;s client obtained expert advice and a plan for program evaluation was developed in collaboration with health service researchers at Queens University.<br>
<br>
Results: The Oshawa Health Centre successfully grew to a collaborative group of 35 health professionals and staff members from 12 two years previous, and provides comprehensive, high quality primary care services to the Durham community.  Debt/equity ratios have improved dramatically.<br>
<br>
HFHG&#39;s Learning Model of Integrated Care (LMIC) has received national attention with a presentation at the 2007 National Health Leadership Conference, a feature article in the September 2007 Medical Post entitled Programs that Work, and has been cited by the Health Quality Council.  The (LMIC) article is currently under review for publication.

              EXECUTIVE CONSULTING, CANADIAN FORCES HEALTH SERVICES<br>
<br>
Internally reporting to the Director, Health Human Resources and Training, relating to the Director General Health Services, the Surgeon General of Canada and senior administrative staff.<br>
<br>
Opportunity: The opportunity existed to assist the Canadian Forces Health Services (CFHS) in the analysis and development of strategic plans for short and long term Health Human Resources (HHR) to address the expanding needs for health services in an increasingly operational environment faced by the Canadian Forces (CF).<br>
<br>
Actions:  An environmental scan and trend analysis was completed regarding physician resources throughout Canada.  Training opportunities in family medicine at the undergraduate and graduate level, specifically for the CF, were negotiated with Deans of Admissions Departments of medical schools across Canada.  Administrative protocols were established for streamlined recruitment, including expeditious security clearance for physicians and medical students entering the CF at all career levels.  Licensing requirements in a multi-jurisdictional environment were developed as part of the protocols, in addition to task-specific training requirements.  Costing for all entry level plans and existing staff was conducted and advice provided in compliance with   the environmental scan to develop compensation packages for CF Medical Officers.  This included present value calculation of all compensation and pension plans as part of the offering.  Employment contracts for CF physicians were analyzed in detail.<br>
<br>
Internal resource optimization was conducted in part through detailed review of the $34M HHR outsourcing contract.  Areas within the contractual document to optimize returns to the CF were reviewed in detail with CF legal counsel.  A detailed opportunity and risk/ benefit analysis was produced for high ranking executives consideration.<br>
<br>
Results:  A detailed ten year strategic plan, to ensure predictable availability of physician resources, was adopted by the CFHS executive.  Through collaboration with allied health executive staff, the plan developed was adopted as the current template for strategic HHR resource planning by CFHS.<br>
<br>
EXECUTIVE CONSULTING, CANADIAN FORCES HEALTH SERVICES<br>
<br>
Opportunity:  The Canadian Forces Health Services branch was the Canadian pioneers in the training and utilization of Physician Assistants (PAs), a health provider that is a significant component of the US health system with 65,000 currently practicing PAs.  To fulfill accreditation requirements for continuing endorsement by the Canadian Medical Association (CMA), the Canadian Association of Physician Assistants (CAPA) and the allied Canadian Council for Physician Assistant Certification (CCPAC) required executive guidance in the evolution to become independent not-for-profit organizations (NPO), representing a new national regulated health provider.<br>
<br>
Actions: Internal reporting was as previously noted, in addition to directly reporting to the 14 member CAPA Board of Directors.  While administrative support existed in Ottawa, the associations functioned on a national basis with personnel distributed across Canada.<br>
 <br>
The PA education and training plans were reviewed through assessment of the Canadian Forces Medical Services School program and curriculum.  A comprehensive health labour trend and competitive analysis through literature review and stakeholder consultations was created to optimize positioning of the PA profession in the context of a competitive mid-level health provider arena.  This was conducted in the dual scenarios of the PA profession as a current non-regulated health provider and the implications of pursuing regulation under provincial Acts, particularly in compliance with the requirements for regulation through the Health Professions Regulatory Advisory Committee (HPRAC) in Ontario.<br>
<br>
Current legal status of CAPA and CCPAC was reviewed at length through discussions of funding agreements and by-laws with CF legal counsel.  Optimal governance of the association was illustrated to the Board of Directors through my advice in addition to training and ongoing consultation with the DeGroote School of Business, Health Leadership Institute. <br>
<br>
Optimal resource utilization made it apparent to align with the strategic objectives of the Ministry of Ontario Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) in view of the 2006 Ministerial announcement to include PAs in the provinces health provider mix.  In-depth dialogue was established with the Assistant Deputy Minister of Health and responsible staff, to ensure CAPAs and CCPACs position as the representative bodies for the profession in Ontario.  Ministry and professional needs for practice liability insurance were met and implemented, initially through discussions with the Canadian Medical Protective Association, followed by research, analysis and solicitation to the private market.<br>
<br>
The rollout of the initial Ontario PA pilot projects aligned with the Ministrys and Associations needs, and were facilitated through extensive discussion with MOHLTC legal staff, review of employment contracts and compensation plans, and the negotiation of prerequisites for CCPAC certification in conjunction with the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA) hiring criteria.<br>
<br>
Financial sustainability for the Association was planned through Activity Based Costing (ABC) of strategic objectives over a five year period, including infrastructure assessment and HR staff planning.  Review of a $5M Treasury Board Contribution application was performed, in addition to identification of other public and private funding sources.  On the recommendation of the Executive-in-Residence at DeGroote and the CAPA Board, Letters Patent and a governance structure were drafted for a separate NPO which would act as a Foundation for the Association.  Legal implications of a separate NPO as well as the details of the Letters Patent were reviewed with CF legal counsel.  Finally, a strategic plan with costing, risk/benefit analysis was formed for professional regulation through an application to the Ontario Minister and subsequent referral to HPRAC.<br>
<br>
Results:  Both CAPA and CCPAC evolved to become thriving organizations, firmly entrenched as a leading stakeholder in the development and implementation of the Physician Assistant profession.

Opportunity: The Oshawa Health Centre required experienced healthcare executive guidance and leadership in fulfilling its ambitious vision to become a leading edge care centre for the region with integrated care expertise to be disseminated on a national basis.<br>
<br>
Actions: Current operating costs, balance sheet and cash flow reports were thoroughly analyzed for the transition into a facility four-fold the size of the previous centre.  Detailed financial plans were constructed with elaboration of current and future management and characteristics of debt/asset accumulation with corresponding operating costs and cash flows.  Financial resource objectives were implemented to ensure long term sustainability of the centre with a recruiting strategy for private health care services as well as practitioners to form a core group for the facilitys delivery of health care to the community.  The financial objectives developed were congruence with the overall vision of the centre to improve access for the community and develop best practices in multidisciplinary, integrated care. <br>
<br>
Resulting from our in-depth experience in the healthcare marketplace, optimal lease agreements were negotiated with service organizations to maximally benefit service to the community and impact revenue streams.  Compensation packages and benefits were formulated to create a competitive offering to the market and the recruiting strategy was successfully implemented in association with the Durham Chamber of Commerce.  Numerous detailed applications to the MOHLTC for public funding support were made through various envelopes identified as a result of research and ongoing relations with senior Ministry staff.  Integration of resources in a regional context was developed through consultation with senior hospital, LHIN, and political executives and staff.<br>
<br>
Administrative and support staff protocols were formed and documented to optimize human resource utility and satisfaction with standardized training programs.  Such documents were crucial in the equitable settlement of employee and union issues with administrative staff.  <br>
<br>
Annual reports to Revenue Canada were reviewed prior to Chartered Accountant preparation for submission to maximize compliance with legislation and reporting requirements.<br>
<br>
To develop shared vision and collaboration in a rapidly expanding professional and administrative staff, tenets of the Learning Organization (Senge, MIT, 1990) were adapted to multidisciplinary care giving rise to the Learning Model of Integrated Care (Ashton, Duffie, Aiken, 2007).  HFHG&#39;s client obtained expert advice and a plan for program evaluation was developed in collaboration with health service researchers at Queens University.<br>
<br>
Results: The Oshawa Health Centre successfully grew to a collaborative group of 35 health professionals and staff members from 12 two years previous, and provides comprehensive, high quality primary care services to the Durham community.  Debt/equity ratios have improved dramatically.<br>
<br>
HFHG&#39;s Learning Model of Integrated Care (LMIC) has received national attention with a presentation at the 2007 National Health Leadership Conference, a feature article in the September 2007 Medical Post entitled Programs that Work, and has been cited by the Health Quality Council.  The (LMIC) article is currently under review for publication.

              </h4>
           
              EXECUTIVE CONSULTING, CANADIAN FORCES HEALTH SERVICES<br>
<br>
Internally reporting to the Director, Health Human Resources and Training, relating to the Director General Health Services, the Surgeon General of Canada and senior administrative staff.<br>
<br>
Opportunity: The opportunity existed to assist the Canadian Forces Health Services (CFHS) in the analysis and development of strategic plans for short and long term Health Human Resources (HHR) to address the expanding needs for health services in an increasingly operational environment faced by the Canadian Forces (CF).<br>
<br>
Actions:  An environmental scan and trend analysis was completed regarding physician resources throughout Canada.  Training opportunities in family medicine at the undergraduate and graduate level, specifically for the CF, were negotiated with Deans of Admissions Departments of medical schools across Canada.  Administrative protocols were established for streamlined recruitment, including expeditious security clearance for physicians and medical students entering the CF at all career levels.  Licensing requirements in a multi-jurisdictional environment were developed as part of the protocols, in addition to task-specific training requirements.  Costing for all entry level plans and existing staff was conducted and advice provided in compliance with   the environmental scan to develop compensation packages for CF Medical Officers.  This included present value calculation of all compensation and pension plans as part of the offering.  Employment contracts for CF physicians were analyzed in detail.<br>
<br>
Internal resource optimization was conducted in part through detailed review of the $34M HHR outsourcing contract.  Areas within the contractual document to optimize returns to the CF were reviewed in detail with CF legal counsel.  A detailed opportunity and risk/ benefit analysis was produced for high ranking executives consideration.<br>
<br>
Results:  A detailed ten year strategic plan, to ensure predictable availability of physician resources, was adopted by the CFHS executive.  Through collaboration with allied health executive staff, the plan developed was adopted as the current template for strategic HHR resource planning by CFHS.<br>
<br>
EXECUTIVE CONSULTING, CANADIAN FORCES HEALTH SERVICES<br>
<br>
Opportunity:  The Canadian Forces Health Services branch was the Canadian pioneers in the training and utilization of Physician Assistants (PAs), a health provider that is a significant component of the US health system with 65,000 currently practicing PAs.  To fulfill accreditation requirements for continuing endorsement by the Canadian Medical Association (CMA), the Canadian Association of Physician Assistants (CAPA) and the allied Canadian Council for Physician Assistant Certification (CCPAC) required executive guidance in the evolution to become independent not-for-profit organizations (NPO), representing a new national regulated health provider.<br>
<br>
Actions: Internal reporting was as previously noted, in addition to directly reporting to the 14 member CAPA Board of Directors.  While administrative support existed in Ottawa, the associations functioned on a national basis with personnel distributed across Canada.<br>
 <br>
The PA education and training plans were reviewed through assessment of the Canadian Forces Medical Services School program and curriculum.  A comprehensive health labour trend and competitive analysis through literature review and stakeholder consultations was created to optimize positioning of the PA profession in the context of a competitive mid-level health provider arena.  This was conducted in the dual scenarios of the PA profession as a current non-regulated health provider and the implications of pursuing regulation under provincial Acts, particularly in compliance with the requirements for regulation through the Health Professions Regulatory Advisory Committee (HPRAC) in Ontario.<br>
<br>
Current legal status of CAPA and CCPAC was reviewed at length through discussions of funding agreements and by-laws with CF legal counsel.  Optimal governance of the association was illustrated to the Board of Directors through my advice in addition to training and ongoing consultation with the DeGroote School of Business, Health Leadership Institute. <br>
<br>
Optimal resource utilization made it apparent to align with the strategic objectives of the Ministry of Ontario Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) in view of the 2006 Ministerial announcement to include PAs in the provinces health provider mix.  In-depth dialogue was established with the Assistant Deputy Minister of Health and responsible staff, to ensure CAPAs and CCPACs position as the representative bodies for the profession in Ontario.  Ministry and professional needs for practice liability insurance were met and implemented, initially through discussions with the Canadian Medical Protective Association, followed by research, analysis and solicitation to the private market.<br>
<br>
The rollout of the initial Ontario PA pilot projects aligned with the Ministrys and Associations needs, and were facilitated through extensive discussion with MOHLTC legal staff, review of employment contracts and compensation plans, and the negotiation of prerequisites for CCPAC certification in conjunction with the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA) hiring criteria.<br>
<br>
Financial sustainability for the Association was planned through Activity Based Costing (ABC) of strategic objectives over a five year period, including infrastructure assessment and HR staff planning.  Review of a $5M Treasury Board Contribution application was performed, in addition to identification of other public and private funding sources.  On the recommendation of the Executive-in-Residence at DeGroote and the CAPA Board, Letters Patent and a governance structure were drafted for a separate NPO which would act as a Foundation for the Association.  Legal implications of a separate NPO as well as the details of the Letters Patent were reviewed with CF legal counsel.  Finally, a strategic plan with costing, risk/benefit analysis was formed for professional regulation through an application to the Ontario Minister and subsequent referral to HPRAC.<br>
<br>
Results:  Both CAPA and CCPAC evolved to become thriving organizations, firmly entrenched as a leading stakeholder in the development and implementation of the Physician Assistant profession.
