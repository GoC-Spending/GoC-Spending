                            Analytic Systems manufactures two different kinds of DC-DC Voltage Converters. The first is Common Negative, where the input and the output share the same ground. These do not typically use a transformer and are less expensive to build. Models are available to step-down (Buck), step up (Boost), or a combination of step down and step up (Buck-Boost). The second is Isolated, where a high frequency transformer is used to provide electrical isolation between input and output. These are typically used where there are different grounds for the input and output voltages, or if there is a large difference between the input voltage and output voltage.<br>
<br>
Common Negative: <br>
Step down VTC140, VTC180, VTC240, VTC300 and VTC600 models from handle up to 100 VDC input, stepping down to 12 to 48 VDC with power ranges 90 to 600 watts . Step up VTC305 and VTC605 models stabilize a 12V system, or step 12VDC up to 24 or 32 VDC with power ranges of 300 to 600 watts. Buck-Boost models for 18 to 30VDC input to 24VDC output are available by request.<br>
<br>
Fully Isolated:<br>
<br>
Models from 300 watts to 1500 watts in both shelf and rack mount. Low input voltage VTC315, VTC615 and VTC1015 models handle input voltages from 24 to 72VDC. High input voltage VTC310, VTC610, VTC1000 and VTC1505 models handle input voltages from 100 to 400 VDC. All models have output voltage ranges from 12 to 48 VDC. Bright easy to read LED voltage and current meters are an available option on most models.<br>
<br>
Also available is a hybrid VTC120i model that features transformer isolated 12 or 14 VDC Input and 5, 12 or 24 VDC Output with a 5 amp (VTC120i) or 7 amp (VTC120ih) linear post-regulator for the lowest ripple and noise.<br>

                            Analytic Systems has been producing Pure Sinewave Inverters since 1994. Originally designed for running navigation computers on commercial and fishing vessels, the line has evolved into a range of models with power outputs from 300 to 3600 watts featuring Digital Signal Processor control. High power MosFet technology creates a low voltage Sinewave that is fed into a compact toroidal step-up transformer to produce a very clean low EMI AC output. Northrup Grumman evaluated inverters from all major manufacturers and chose the IPSi series by Analytic Systems for their Army portable command centers for precisely this reason.<br>
<br>
Battery voltages of 12, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72 and 125 volts DC are supported, although the SPSi2400 and SPSi3600 are not available for 12 volts DC In (currents are too high) and the SPS300 does not support 125 volts DC In.<br>
<br>
All models are available in a standard shelf mount industrial form factor and also in a more rugged MS configuration featuring military connectors for both DC In and AC Out connections along with extra ruggedization and wide temperature operation.<br>
<br>
Using the free to download ‘Power Wizard’ software, the user can select output frequency, output voltage (within +/- 10 percent of the standard voltage), output frequency (50 or 60 Hz) and low voltage shutdown parameters (to match the battery voltage) from any laptop through the standard micro-usb interface.<br>
<br>
Safety features include current limiting, short circuit protection, inrush protection (during connection to the DC source), over-temperature de-rating and shutdown and low input voltage warning and shutdown. Most models offer an Off-Line UPS options that allows external AC to be routed through the inverter for high power UPS function if the external AC fails.<br>

                            Whether you produce electricity from Wind Turbines, Solar Panels or Small Scale Hydro Electric systems, the power needs to be stored in battery banks without wasting a watt. <br>
<br>
Analytic Systems’ patented MPPT Charge Controllers handle open circuit input voltages to 200 Volts and pump out up to 100 amps into battery banks up to 48 VDC. A full line of high efficiency DC-AC Inverters and DC-DC Voltage Converters up to 3000 watts output allow the stored energy to be used for any desired purpose. Aluminum enclosures, stainless fasteners, conformal coated circuit boards and conservative components ensure long life and reliability.<br>

Application: Clean, Well-Controlled Power &quot;Although there are plenty of larger (2kw) and up inverters from which to choose, when the application demands quality regulated output from a smaller unit, with the notable exception of those produced by Analytic Systems, the results are usually disappointing. Time and again I have customers who have purchased small RV or marine superstore inverters complain that; &quot;the TV has lines, the sound system or radio is noisy, small battery chargers don&#39;t work etc.&quot; My response is &quot;what do you expect? You are asking a cheaply produced and sold toy to do a sophisticated job&quot;. Some do some don&#39;t. Operating these kind of appliances successfully and with out potential damage requires clean stable power input.<br>
<br>
Both the quasi-sine and sine wave inverters from Analytic Systems produce just that, clean, well-regulated, stable power. Noisy TV sets, sound systems clean up, tools deliver full power. Battery chargers don&#39;t &quot;fry&quot; the battery and so on.<br>
<br>
Even more importantly, more sophisticated stuff such as scientific monitors, meters, and other recording and analytic equipment simply won&#39;t work properly if at all on mass market small inverters. This expensive equipment which may be analyzing or monitoring critical environmental or industrial processes require the best power input possible, not to mention potential damage to the equipment from fluctuating voltage, current and frequency. You get what you pay for and while the other units may adequately power most appliances satisfactorily, if you require clean well controlled power input you can&#39;t beat Analytic&#39;s inverters.&quot;<br>

                            Analytic Systems manufactures two different kinds of DC-DC Voltage Converters. The first is Common Negative, where the input and the output share the same ground. These do not typically use a transformer and are less expensive to build. Models are available to step-down (Buck), step up (Boost), or a combination of step down and step up (Buck-Boost). The second is Isolated, where a high frequency transformer is used to provide electrical isolation between input and output. These are typically used where there are different grounds for the input and output voltages, or if there is a large difference between the input voltage and output voltage.<br>
<br>
Common Negative: <br>
Step down VTC140, VTC180, VTC240, VTC300 and VTC600 models from handle up to 100 VDC input, stepping down to 12 to 48 VDC with power ranges 90 to 600 watts . Step up VTC305 and VTC605 models stabilize a 12V system, or step 12VDC up to 24 or 32 VDC with power ranges of 300 to 600 watts. Buck-Boost models for 18 to 30VDC input to 24VDC output are available by request.<br>
<br>
Fully Isolated:<br>
<br>
Models from 300 watts to 1500 watts in both shelf and rack mount. Low input voltage VTC315, VTC615 and VTC1015 models handle input voltages from 24 to 72VDC. High input voltage VTC310, VTC610, VTC1000 and VTC1505 models handle input voltages from 100 to 400 VDC. All models have output voltage ranges from 12 to 48 VDC. Bright easy to read LED voltage and current meters are an available option on most models.<br>
<br>
Also available is a hybrid VTC120i model that features transformer isolated 12 or 14 VDC Input and 5, 12 or 24 VDC Output with a 5 amp (VTC120i) or 7 amp (VTC120ih) linear post-regulator for the lowest ripple and noise.<br>

                            Analytic Systems has been producing Pure Sinewave Inverters since 1994. Originally designed for running navigation computers on commercial and fishing vessels, the line has evolved into a range of models with power outputs from 300 to 3600 watts featuring Digital Signal Processor control. High power MosFet technology creates a low voltage Sinewave that is fed into a compact toroidal step-up transformer to produce a very clean low EMI AC output. Northrup Grumman evaluated inverters from all major manufacturers and chose the IPSi series by Analytic Systems for their Army portable command centers for precisely this reason.<br>
<br>
Battery voltages of 12, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72 and 125 volts DC are supported, although the SPSi2400 and SPSi3600 are not available for 12 volts DC In (currents are too high) and the SPS300 does not support 125 volts DC In.<br>
<br>
All models are available in a standard shelf mount industrial form factor and also in a more rugged MS configuration featuring military connectors for both DC In and AC Out connections along with extra ruggedization and wide temperature operation.<br>
<br>
Using the free to download ‘Power Wizard’ software, the user can select output frequency, output voltage (within +/- 10 percent of the standard voltage), output frequency (50 or 60 Hz) and low voltage shutdown parameters (to match the battery voltage) from any laptop through the standard micro-usb interface.<br>
<br>
Safety features include current limiting, short circuit protection, inrush protection (during connection to the DC source), over-temperature de-rating and shutdown and low input voltage warning and shutdown. Most models offer an Off-Line UPS options that allows external AC to be routed through the inverter for high power UPS function if the external AC fails.<br>

                            Analytic Systems began in the marine market, with the first 32 to 12 volt Switchmode DC-DC voltage converter designed in 1976 by founder Lloyd Hargrove specifically for powering 12V 150 Watt SSB radios directly from 32V engine starting batteries. <br>
<br>
Today we manufacture a full line of marine grade power conversion products including step-up and step-down DC to DC Voltage Converters from 60 to 1500 Watts, Multi-Bank Programmable Battery Chargers for 12, 24 and 32 volt batteries up to 100 Amps and Pure Sine Wave DC to AC Inverters from 12, 24 or 32 volt batteries up to 3000 Watts.<br>

                            Whether you produce electricity from Wind Turbines, Solar Panels or Small Scale Hydro Electric systems, the power needs to be stored in battery banks without wasting a watt. <br>
<br>
Analytic Systems’ patented MPPT Charge Controllers handle open circuit input voltages to 200 Volts and pump out up to 100 amps into battery banks up to 48 VDC. A full line of high efficiency DC-AC Inverters and DC-DC Voltage Converters up to 3000 watts output allow the stored energy to be used for any desired purpose. Aluminum enclosures, stainless fasteners, conformal coated circuit boards and conservative components ensure long life and reliability.<br>

              We received the 650W power supply and were very impressed. It is rugged and has performed well for us. Thank you for helping us through the purchase process.<br>
Have a good evening,<br>

The IVS1000 inverter we bought from you last year is working nicely. The time has arrived (overdue) to get a spare inverter. <br>

I really appreciate your follow through on our potential equipment needs. Your equipment worked flawlessly in our first season. We now have at least one season ahead of us before we will be in need of added equipment. If more is needed, you definitely will be our supplier of choice.<br>

Application: Clean, Well-Controlled Power &quot;Although there are plenty of larger (2kw) and up inverters from which to choose, when the application demands quality regulated output from a smaller unit, with the notable exception of those produced by Analytic Systems, the results are usually disappointing. Time and again I have customers who have purchased small RV or marine superstore inverters complain that; &quot;the TV has lines, the sound system or radio is noisy, small battery chargers don&#39;t work etc.&quot; My response is &quot;what do you expect? You are asking a cheaply produced and sold toy to do a sophisticated job&quot;. Some do some don&#39;t. Operating these kind of appliances successfully and with out potential damage requires clean stable power input.<br>
<br>
Both the quasi-sine and sine wave inverters from Analytic Systems produce just that, clean, well-regulated, stable power. Noisy TV sets, sound systems clean up, tools deliver full power. Battery chargers don&#39;t &quot;fry&quot; the battery and so on.<br>
<br>
Even more importantly, more sophisticated stuff such as scientific monitors, meters, and other recording and analytic equipment simply won&#39;t work properly if at all on mass market small inverters. This expensive equipment which may be analyzing or monitoring critical environmental or industrial processes require the best power input possible, not to mention potential damage to the equipment from fluctuating voltage, current and frequency. You get what you pay for and while the other units may adequately power most appliances satisfactorily, if you require clean well controlled power input you can&#39;t beat Analytic&#39;s inverters.&quot;<br>
