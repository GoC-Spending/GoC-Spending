              &quot;We have found Eric to provide quick and thorough service in situations that demand immediate response.  Eric can provide information to our employees with little or no notice. Eric is a capable and energetic consultant to our site and continually provides value-added services<br>
Mr. Alex Bustard, P. Eng.<br>
LANXESS Inc.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this, or any business, success is all about being able to find that niche that sets you above and beyond your competition. This can be achieved in many ways. Be it demonstrating exemplary people skills and the ability to connect with your clients on a personal level, or being able to offer consistent  reliable  prompt and professional services to your clients day in and day out without exception. Eric has managed to achieve both these qualities. From the experiences we have had with Eric I am sure he will continue to grow, prosper and continue to be an exceptional asset to the Sarnia-Lambton Community for years to come.<br>
Mr. John Hardick, President<br>
Canadian Industrial Specialties Ltd.<br>
<br>
Mr. Ruggles on many occasions has provided prompt and exceptional services, any time that advice is required; Eric Ruggles has shared his expertise and knowledge. I would not hesitate to recommend him.<br>
Mr. Sigfred Carletti<br>
Belfor Property Restoration<br>
<br>
I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Eric Ruggles over the past three years. During that time Eric was the key contact related to a number of construction projects that the County of Lambton was undertaking. Each project included significant issues related to Health and Safety as well as environmental concerns.  I can attest to the fact that Eric provided professional and courteous service for the duration of both projects. He displayed sensitivity to issues at hand and provided a high level of customer service.<br>
Mr. Howard Lucas<br>
Manager, Procurement and Projects<br>
County of Lambton<br>
<br>
I had the pleasure of working with Eric ... extremely professional and courteous ...<br>
he arrived promptly at our centre and sat down and listened to our concerns (both the tenants and our boards). He addressed his qualifications and the procedures that he would take to complete the testing. He walked through the area in question and was empathetic to our tenants concerns. Eric immediately brought in the necessary testing equipment and within a short period of time was able to put both our tenants and boards concerns at ease... I would recommend his services to anyone facing air quality concerns.<br>
Anita Minielly, Executive Director<br>
The Chris Dawson Foundation<br>
<br>
Our company has dealt with Eric Ruggles for many years. Dealing with insurance claims can be tenuous and we must rely on responsible and knowledgeable service providers to be of assistance to the insured and insurers. Eric Ruggles service has been extraordinary. He is responsive to our needs and those of the property owner. He provides excellent, concise reports that help everyone understand the complexities of dealing with todays restoration business. Eric created ENSPEC so that he could be more<br>
responsive to the local community and our small local businesses. He saw a need for the non-large corporate entities and he created ENSPEC Inc. to respond quickly, accurately and financially responsibly to the needs of small business and private property owners in Lambton County.<br>
David F. Calquhoun<br>
Crawford and Company<br>
<br>
Mr. Ruggles has always responded quickly to Community-Living Sarnia LambtonHe often performs the investigations himself and is professional to all whom he encounters. Mr. Ruggles provides correspondence regularly throughout the course of all projects to allow Community-Living Sarnia Lambton to make informed decisions during an investigation. He often provides valuable resources (at no additional cost) including qualified sub-contractors, interpretation of regulations, etc., to aid in investigations or remediation where required. Mr. Ruggles adheres to his proposed scheduling and often outlines his intentions and scheduling prior to mobilization to a particular site. Mr. Ruggles is a well-spoken, polite and professional individual and I have never heard anything less than the same. Mr. Ruggles provides clear and detailed final products which can be understood by all employees, sub-contractors, health and safety committee members, and even The Ministry of Labour.<br>
The Ministry of Labour and our Local Union havehave never questioned Eric`s outcomes.<br>
Mr. John Hagens, Executive Director<br>
Community Living Sarnia-Lambton<br>
<br>
Mr. Ruggles service is one that many people do not have the background to understand and because of this his fairness, genuine concern and approachable manner developed a level of trust that put my mind at ease. I am quick to suggest ENSPEC to anyone that has had the same situation or in need of environmental hygienic diagnosis. Not only does Mr. Ruggles possess the knowledge to satisfy industrial clients but he has the sincerity and compassion to ease the everyday residential client. Mr. Eric Ruggles is a most deserving businessman and friend to those of us that need an understanding face when dealing with an issue that is not easily understood.<br>

              &quot;We have found Eric to provide quick and thorough service in situations that demand immediate response.  Eric can provide information to our employees with little or no notice. Eric is a capable and energetic consultant to our site and continually provides value-added services<br>
Mr. Alex Bustard, P. Eng.<br>
LANXESS Inc.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this, or any business, success is all about being able to find that niche that sets you above and beyond your competition. This can be achieved in many ways. Be it demonstrating exemplary people skills and the ability to connect with your clients on a personal level, or being able to offer consistent  reliable  prompt and professional services to your clients day in and day out without exception. Eric has managed to achieve both these qualities. From the experiences we have had with Eric I am sure he will continue to grow, prosper and continue to be an exceptional asset to the Sarnia-Lambton Community for years to come.<br>
Mr. John Hardick, President<br>
Canadian Industrial Specialties Ltd.<br>
<br>
Mr. Ruggles on many occasions has provided prompt and exceptional services, any time that advice is required; Eric Ruggles has shared his expertise and knowledge. I would not hesitate to recommend him.<br>
Mr. Sigfred Carletti<br>
Belfor Property Restoration<br>
<br>
I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Eric Ruggles over the past three years. During that time Eric was the key contact related to a number of construction projects that the County of Lambton was undertaking. Each project included significant issues related to Health and Safety as well as environmental concerns.  I can attest to the fact that Eric provided professional and courteous service for the duration of both projects. He displayed sensitivity to issues at hand and provided a high level of customer service.<br>
Mr. Howard Lucas<br>
Manager, Procurement and Projects<br>
County of Lambton<br>
<br>
I had the pleasure of working with Eric ... extremely professional and courteous ...<br>
he arrived promptly at our centre and sat down and listened to our concerns (both the tenants and our boards). He addressed his qualifications and the procedures that he would take to complete the testing. He walked through the area in question and was empathetic to our tenants concerns. Eric immediately brought in the necessary testing equipment and within a short period of time was able to put both our tenants and boards concerns at ease... I would recommend his services to anyone facing air quality concerns.<br>
Anita Minielly, Executive Director<br>
The Chris Dawson Foundation<br>
<br>
Our company has dealt with Eric Ruggles for many years. Dealing with insurance claims can be tenuous and we must rely on responsible and knowledgeable service providers to be of assistance to the insured and insurers. Eric Ruggles service has been extraordinary. He is responsive to our needs and those of the property owner. He provides excellent, concise reports that help everyone understand the complexities of dealing with todays restoration business. Eric created ENSPEC so that he could be more<br>
responsive to the local community and our small local businesses. He saw a need for the non-large corporate entities and he created ENSPEC Inc. to respond quickly, accurately and financially responsibly to the needs of small business and private property owners in Lambton County.<br>
David F. Calquhoun<br>
Crawford and Company<br>
<br>
Mr. Ruggles has always responded quickly to Community-Living Sarnia LambtonHe often performs the investigations himself and is professional to all whom he encounters. Mr. Ruggles provides correspondence regularly throughout the course of all projects to allow Community-Living Sarnia Lambton to make informed decisions during an investigation. He often provides valuable resources (at no additional cost) including qualified sub-contractors, interpretation of regulations, etc., to aid in investigations or remediation where required. Mr. Ruggles adheres to his proposed scheduling and often outlines his intentions and scheduling prior to mobilization to a particular site. Mr. Ruggles is a well-spoken, polite and professional individual and I have never heard anything less than the same. Mr. Ruggles provides clear and detailed final products which can be understood by all employees, sub-contractors, health and safety committee members, and even The Ministry of Labour.<br>
The Ministry of Labour and our Local Union havehave never questioned Eric`s outcomes.<br>
Mr. John Hagens, Executive Director<br>
Community Living Sarnia-Lambton<br>
<br>
Mr. Ruggles service is one that many people do not have the background to understand and because of this his fairness, genuine concern and approachable manner developed a level of trust that put my mind at ease. I am quick to suggest ENSPEC to anyone that has had the same situation or in need of environmental hygienic diagnosis. Not only does Mr. Ruggles possess the knowledge to satisfy industrial clients but he has the sincerity and compassion to ease the everyday residential client. Mr. Eric Ruggles is a most deserving businessman and friend to those of us that need an understanding face when dealing with an issue that is not easily understood.<br>
