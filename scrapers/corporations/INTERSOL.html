                            Throughout the public and private sectors, the need to involve employees and stakeholders in the shaping of policies and programs  as well as products and services- continues to grow.  Intersol provides comprehensive employee, stakeholder and public consultation services.    We incorporate a number of people engagement and consultation strategies depending on the requirements and culture of the organization or groups including: lecture series, town-hall meetings, bear-pit sessions, think-tanks, armchair discussions, forums, study tours, round table discussions, breakout group discussions, and electronic consultations.<br>
<br>
Whether the consultation is local or national in scope, Intersol brings state of the art design in public consultation, which includes logistics, facilitation, coordination and reporting.  For large-group consultation, we have adapted the intervention methodology developed by the U.S. firm Dannemiller Tyson for the Canadian context.<br>

                            Creating and sustaining high performance teams, within and across functional boundaries, is a major challenge for organizations. Intersol has structured approaches and methodologies to work with high performing and project teams.  This may include project team start-up and correction, process improvement, team performance, re-engineering and conflict resolution.<br>
Intersol helps teams to address specific, time-sensitive issues by providing processes and group dynamics skills which allow task-oriented teams to make the best use of their resources and to explore challenges, solve problems, make decisions and develop action plans.<br>
<br>
Intersols consultants are equipped to help leaders and teams identify and address important alignment issues and challenges.  Leading and participating in teams requires skills that do not necessarily come naturally. Intersol has programs to help team members acquire the skills of high performance team members.  Intersol also creates and customizes training for project leaders and teams. Intersols generic process toolbox can accommodate and build on existing corporate project management methods.<br>

              </h4>
           
              Intersol has significant experience working with large organizations that are national in scope, which include federal, provincial and municipals governments, and national and international corporations.  The following projects provide a synopsis of the types of services that we are typically engaged for by our clients.<br>
<br>
Canada Post Corporation:  Executive Strategy Renewal<br>
The COO at Canada Post brought together his team of Vice Presidents in January, 2005 to plan future strategies for the corporation.  Significant work had been done by all parts of the organization in preparation for the workshop.  Each division was to put forth its proposals for strategies which would enable Canada Post to move forward most effectively.  The purpose of the meeting was to share information on progress being made and to identify priorities for further consideration.  Intersol contributed to the planning of the agenda and process for the meeting to follow.  The role was to work with meeting organizers and VP representatives to ensure the approach and methodology met their needs and to help plan the session.  Intersol then facilitated the one-day strategy renewal session.<br>
<br>
Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)/Ontario Region: Strategies for Settlement and Language Training<br>
In May through August 2006, the governments of Canada and Ontario agreed to develop a collaborative planning, priority setting and evaluation process for federal and provincial settlement services and funding in Ontario and to develop and implement a coordinated adult language training system. The governments identified the need for current information on the needs of newcomers to Ontario, unmet needs and expectations plus the perspectives and experience of service organizations and delivery system in responding to those newcomers. This required a specifically designed consultation with deep reach into the newcomer community and the service delivery system. As consultants to Citizenship and Immigration Canada-Ontario Region and the Ministry of Immigration and Citizenship, the Team (comprised of Intersol in partnership with InterQuest and Graybridge Malkam) designed, facilitated and reported on a series of sessions in eleven cities across Ontario within a 4-week time span. The purpose of the sessions was to provide input to the development of the four year strategy from the perspective of the newcomers and the service delivery organizations and  to  inform the design of specific strategies to address unmet needs, improve relevant services, harmonize programs and funding, and move toward more integrated, more user friendly and accessible delivery models. <br>
<br>
Council of the Federation (COF)/ Ontario Ministry of Intergovernmental Affairs (MIA):  National Summit on Post Secondary Education<br>
The COF/MIA  hosted a National Summit with approximately 300 stakeholders from the post-secondary education and skills training sectors. The event was hosted by Premiers McGuinty and Charest.  Also present were 6 other Premiers and numerous provincial and territorial ministers. <br>
The Summit encompassed stakeholders from all provinces and territories and planned to develop options that would contribute to the Council of the Federation strategy on matters and issues affecting stakeholders. Students, colleges, universities, business, labour, provinces and territories discussed key issues and challenges in post-secondary education and skills training, with the goal of generating ideas, targets and options for the future. Intersol provided guidance and advice on the design of the Summit. Intersol provided end-to-end bilingual facilitation of the event.  The facilitation services provided by Intersol included lead facilitation for plenary sessions throughout the day, as well as bilingual facilitation services for 14 breakout discussions that ran concurrently.   Intersol also led the report back by each of the breakout groups to plenary and the eight Premiers.<br>
<br>
Defence Research (DRDC)  Annual Managers Forum<br>
The annual managers forum is an opportunity for the entire management cadre of DRDC (approximately 100 middle and senior managers) to meet and discuss strategy for the agency.  The management group includes the ADM, DGs, directors and managers.  Culturally, this is a group which values leadership and results. During the four years that Intersol has supported this event, themes for the forum have included: Branding the Agency; Our Environment and the Impact of our Science: Broadening our Horizons; Enhancing Internal &amp; External Relationship and in 2005, Embracing our New Frontiers.<br>
<br>
Federal Judicial Affairs(FJA): Leading &amp; Communicating Culture Change<br>
Changing processes is easy  changing culture is more challenging.  FJA needed to respond to its changing environment.  New demands from Treasury Board around HR modernization and the need to streamline process and strategies were two key drivers for change. Working at arms length from the Department of Justice, Federal Judicial Affairs needed to revitalize and develop clear proactive strategies to provide innovative high quality services.  Building staff commitment to both lead and implement these changes was critical to the success of the change initiative.  Intersol provided a sound change framework and a clear structure for the change project. Intersol also designed, developed and delivered change management workshops and provided advice to the employee communication strategy. Employee and management interviews were an integral part of this project.<br>
<br>
Health Canada: Legislative Renewal Consultations - Phase 1<br>
This project involved a series of regional and national consultations to identify the health protection issues and gaps in the current legislative and regulatory framework in Canada. Intersol did the initial scoping out of the consultation project objectives and the project plan, including scale, methods, time frames and costs. Intersol also designed and facilitated the 2 day multi-stakeholder workshops which were held in locations across Canada. Each event brought together approximately 80 to 200 Canadians representing various perspectives and interests of the population, including consumers, industry representatives, special interest groups, academia, provincial government representatives and others. In the 1998 initiative Intersol worked closely with the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Department responsible for the initiative who chaired each of the consultation sessions. Intersol also assisted with the design of materials and data capture tools such as the participant workbooks used to record the views of participants who attended the consultation sessions and other Canadians who could not. The data captured via these tools was then used to prepare the finding reports and ultimately, to develop a legislative proposal to renew the federal health protection legislation. There were multiple meeting dates and locations, including Halifax, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver, Yellowknife, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Whitehorse.<br>
<br>
Health Canada: Legislative Renewal - Phase 2<br>
In 2003, Intersol designed and facilitated a series of multi-stakeholder consultation workshops held across the country, the purpose of which was to obtain feedback on a proposal to renew the federal health protection legislation, that is, the laws aimed at addressing risks to health before they lead to injury or death. Intersol also worked with the secretariat to design the workshops that focused on the proposal generally, and designed several additional workshops that focused on specific themes contained in the proposal where greater discussion was required by informed stakeholders. Intersol designed the session report data capture tools used to assist participants in their discussions and to record their views.<br>
<br>
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC):  Housing and Homelessness Consultations <br>
As consultants to HRSDC and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), Intersol designed, facilitated and reported on a series of one day multi-stakeholder workshops in eleven cities across Canada, within a 5 week time span. Each event brought together approximately 50 to 100 Canadians representing various perspectives and interests of the population including citizens, industry leaders, special interest groups, academia, provincial government representatives and others.  Participants included the Minister, and a panel of senior government executives.  The purpose of the sessions was to provide an opportunity for representatives from community stakeholder groups to present in person, to a federal government panel, their input on the development of a new Canadian Housing framework. The Minister or delegate spoke at each of the sessions and responded to questions.<br>
<br>
Industry Canada: Consultation Blue Print<br>
On behalf of Industry Canada, Intersol developed the Industry Canada Consultation Blueprint.  This guide is intended for Operations Sector staff and managers at all levels who are interested in learning more about employee consultation and engagement and in designing and conducting consultations with employees.  The guide was developed in line with the key values and principles set out in the Public Service Labour Relations Act and with the values of the Operations Sector in mind.<br>
<br>
The tool enables staff, team leaders and managers of all levels to determine who should be consulted as well as gain a more thorough understanding of consultation.  The guide focuses specifically on the hows of consultation.  The roles of facilitator, team builder, negotiator, and diplomat were outside the scope of this initiative.  Intersol developed the guide in collaboration with Industry Canada representatives, leveraging Intersols core intellectual property on facilitation and best practices in consultation.<br>
<br>
Industry Canada: Competition Bureau Management Committee Retreat<br>
Intersol designed, facilitated and reported on the Bureau Management Committees retreat aimed at revising and improving the Bureaus planning cycle and priority setting process.  The objectives of the Bureau Management Committee Retreat were to lay the ground work for the establishment of a short term plan (1 to 2 years), identify high priority, high risk areas, provide opportunities to exchange information and develop new insights.  The retreat led to BMCs development of a draft planning cycle for the bureau as well as a draft plan that contained short term priorities and the elements of a strategic and operational plan. This project involved the facilitation of three small working sessions of 4 to 6 people culminating in a retreat involving over 40 Directors General, Directors and Deputy Commissioners.<br>
<br>
ING  Microsoft Partnering Workshop<br>
Over the course of 2004-2005, Intersol designed, developed, facilitated and reported on a partnering workshop with key executives from the ING Group (Banking and Insurance) and Microsoft Corporation (Software).  The Chief Executive Officers of both corporations had  expressed a desire to develop mutually beneficial business opportunities going beyond the traditional lines of a supplier-client relationship.  Intersol was brought into the project by the Chief Information Officer and the Managing Director for Wholesale Relationships of the ING group and we worked closely with the Microsoft Global Account Representative.  The Team quickly developed a Joint Business Development Approach, the central feature of which is a Think Tank, an idea incubator of sorts that identified, selected and developed innovative ideas related to products and services. Over the course of eight months, a program was assembled to prepare the forty-five participants for the Joint Business Development Framework Think Tank.  Intersol designed and facilitated the process by which Think Tank participants brainstormed, selected and defined ideas that would lead to new products and services beneficial to both businesses.  The Think Tank event took place September 24-30th, 2005.  At the conclusion of the Think Tank, over 25 ideas had been retained and were being further investigated by three distinct teams.  Throughout the project, Intersol facilitated numerous working sessions of executives from both firms.  Facilitated meetings were held in November and December 2004, February 2005, and subsequently on a monthly basis right up until the Think Tank event.<br>
<br>
Lac Carling Congress:  A Unique Annual Forum for Canadian CIOs<br>
The principal requirement of this CIO gathering was for the preparation, design, facilitation and reporting associated with the Lac Carling Congress.  Intersol has been involved in this capacity with Lac Carling Congress IV to X (2000-2005).  The Congress brings together two hundred and fifty CIO and private sector representatives into working sessions.  These working sessions are structured according to Intersols unique adaptation of sound large groups principles and methodologies.  Simply put, specific themes are identified, the content is framed for adequate scope, structured discussions are conducted, common discussion points are identified and the consensus view is then refined into a go forward strategy and related action plan that is the object of a report to subsequent Congresses.<br>
<br>
Ministers Roundtable for the Species at Risk Act (SARA), Environment Canada<br>
Over the course of nine months leading to December 2006, Intersol planned and facilitated the two-day Environment Ministers Roundtable. Participants included senior executives from the various stakeholders including First Nations, environmental organizations, industry, federal/provincial/territorial governments and others. The planning included engaging stakeholders in the development of the agenda.  The purpose of the roundtable was to generate recommendations for the Minister in the implementation of the Species at Risk Act.<br>
<br>
Public Service Commission<br>
Intersol has worked with PSC since 2002.  At that time, Intersol was involved at the corporate level, helping the President and the management team through important change management initiatives.  In February 2002, the PSC Transformation/Modernization project and meeting.  In the spring of that same year, Intersol designed and facilitated a Workshop for Executives and Managers on a HR Modernization and Change Agenda.  In Oct 2003, Intersol facilitated an HR Modernization meeting to discuss a renewed PSC.  Intersol has also worked with different branches/groups:<br>
 PSC Recourse Branch in March 2003 (setting direction and identifying priorities)<br>
 Interdepartmental Group on Conflict Management in Nov 2002 (about identifying terms of reference and planning the work of the group)<br>
 Accountability Directorate; worked throughout 2005 to help improve the effectiveness of the management team and then at an all-staff meeting to identify ways of improving the work of the Directorate and the workplace.<br>
 Planning work/session on PSRS system<br>
 Language Assessment Unit, January 2004<br>
<br>
Intersol also provided consulting and facilitation services in support of the meeting planned for January 15th and 16th, 2004, focusing on the language assessment system.  Outcomes included an action plan focusing on the next 18 months outlining key resources and timeframes.<br>
<br>
Transport Canada - Strategic Planning Workshop<br>
On June 7, 2006, Intersol led the strategic planning exercise for the Security and Emergency Preparedness Directorate of Transport Canada&#39;s Ontario Region.  The Directorate is responsible for regulating security operations across all modes of transportation in Ontario.  This includes ports, airports, bridges and tunnels. Intersol worked with the Directorate executive team to craft the strategic priorities against which resources would be focused the current and following fiscal year. The process centred on a series of two meetings.  The first Meeting focused on the environmental scanning process and identification of key result areas and recommended strategies.  The second meeting involved the validation of recommended strategies and the assignment of priorities for the recommended actions.

                            Throughout the public and private sectors, the need to involve employees and stakeholders in the shaping of policies and programs  as well as products and services- continues to grow.  Intersol provides comprehensive employee, stakeholder and public consultation services.    We incorporate a number of people engagement and consultation strategies depending on the requirements and culture of the organization or groups including: lecture series, town-hall meetings, bear-pit sessions, think-tanks, armchair discussions, forums, study tours, round table discussions, breakout group discussions, and electronic consultations.<br>
<br>
Whether the consultation is local or national in scope, Intersol brings state of the art design in public consultation, which includes logistics, facilitation, coordination and reporting.  For large-group consultation, we have adapted the intervention methodology developed by the U.S. firm Dannemiller Tyson for the Canadian context.<br>

                            Creating and sustaining high performance teams, within and across functional boundaries, is a major challenge for organizations. Intersol has structured approaches and methodologies to work with high performing and project teams.  This may include project team start-up and correction, process improvement, team performance, re-engineering and conflict resolution.<br>
Intersol helps teams to address specific, time-sensitive issues by providing processes and group dynamics skills which allow task-oriented teams to make the best use of their resources and to explore challenges, solve problems, make decisions and develop action plans.<br>
<br>
Intersols consultants are equipped to help leaders and teams identify and address important alignment issues and challenges.  Leading and participating in teams requires skills that do not necessarily come naturally. Intersol has programs to help team members acquire the skills of high performance team members.  Intersol also creates and customizes training for project leaders and teams. Intersols generic process toolbox can accommodate and build on existing corporate project management methods.<br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Intersol has significant experience working with large organizations that are national in scope, which include federal, provincial and municipals governments, and national and international corporations.  The following projects provide a synopsis of the types of services that we are typically engaged for by our clients.<br>
<br>
Canada Post Corporation:  Executive Strategy Renewal<br>
The COO at Canada Post brought together his team of Vice Presidents in January, 2005 to plan future strategies for the corporation.  Significant work had been done by all parts of the organization in preparation for the workshop.  Each division was to put forth its proposals for strategies which would enable Canada Post to move forward most effectively.  The purpose of the meeting was to share information on progress being made and to identify priorities for further consideration.  Intersol contributed to the planning of the agenda and process for the meeting to follow.  The role was to work with meeting organizers and VP representatives to ensure the approach and methodology met their needs and to help plan the session.  Intersol then facilitated the one-day strategy renewal session.<br>
<br>
Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)/Ontario Region: Strategies for Settlement and Language Training<br>
In May through August 2006, the governments of Canada and Ontario agreed to develop a collaborative planning, priority setting and evaluation process for federal and provincial settlement services and funding in Ontario and to develop and implement a coordinated adult language training system. The governments identified the need for current information on the needs of newcomers to Ontario, unmet needs and expectations plus the perspectives and experience of service organizations and delivery system in responding to those newcomers. This required a specifically designed consultation with deep reach into the newcomer community and the service delivery system. As consultants to Citizenship and Immigration Canada-Ontario Region and the Ministry of Immigration and Citizenship, the Team (comprised of Intersol in partnership with InterQuest and Graybridge Malkam) designed, facilitated and reported on a series of sessions in eleven cities across Ontario within a 4-week time span. The purpose of the sessions was to provide input to the development of the four year strategy from the perspective of the newcomers and the service delivery organizations and  to  inform the design of specific strategies to address unmet needs, improve relevant services, harmonize programs and funding, and move toward more integrated, more user friendly and accessible delivery models. <br>
<br>
Council of the Federation (COF)/ Ontario Ministry of Intergovernmental Affairs (MIA):  National Summit on Post Secondary Education<br>
The COF/MIA  hosted a National Summit with approximately 300 stakeholders from the post-secondary education and skills training sectors. The event was hosted by Premiers McGuinty and Charest.  Also present were 6 other Premiers and numerous provincial and territorial ministers. <br>
The Summit encompassed stakeholders from all provinces and territories and planned to develop options that would contribute to the Council of the Federation strategy on matters and issues affecting stakeholders. Students, colleges, universities, business, labour, provinces and territories discussed key issues and challenges in post-secondary education and skills training, with the goal of generating ideas, targets and options for the future. Intersol provided guidance and advice on the design of the Summit. Intersol provided end-to-end bilingual facilitation of the event.  The facilitation services provided by Intersol included lead facilitation for plenary sessions throughout the day, as well as bilingual facilitation services for 14 breakout discussions that ran concurrently.   Intersol also led the report back by each of the breakout groups to plenary and the eight Premiers.<br>
<br>
Defence Research (DRDC)  Annual Managers Forum<br>
The annual managers forum is an opportunity for the entire management cadre of DRDC (approximately 100 middle and senior managers) to meet and discuss strategy for the agency.  The management group includes the ADM, DGs, directors and managers.  Culturally, this is a group which values leadership and results. During the four years that Intersol has supported this event, themes for the forum have included: Branding the Agency; Our Environment and the Impact of our Science: Broadening our Horizons; Enhancing Internal &amp; External Relationship and in 2005, Embracing our New Frontiers.<br>
<br>
Federal Judicial Affairs(FJA): Leading &amp; Communicating Culture Change<br>
Changing processes is easy  changing culture is more challenging.  FJA needed to respond to its changing environment.  New demands from Treasury Board around HR modernization and the need to streamline process and strategies were two key drivers for change. Working at arms length from the Department of Justice, Federal Judicial Affairs needed to revitalize and develop clear proactive strategies to provide innovative high quality services.  Building staff commitment to both lead and implement these changes was critical to the success of the change initiative.  Intersol provided a sound change framework and a clear structure for the change project. Intersol also designed, developed and delivered change management workshops and provided advice to the employee communication strategy. Employee and management interviews were an integral part of this project.<br>
<br>
Health Canada: Legislative Renewal Consultations - Phase 1<br>
This project involved a series of regional and national consultations to identify the health protection issues and gaps in the current legislative and regulatory framework in Canada. Intersol did the initial scoping out of the consultation project objectives and the project plan, including scale, methods, time frames and costs. Intersol also designed and facilitated the 2 day multi-stakeholder workshops which were held in locations across Canada. Each event brought together approximately 80 to 200 Canadians representing various perspectives and interests of the population, including consumers, industry representatives, special interest groups, academia, provincial government representatives and others. In the 1998 initiative Intersol worked closely with the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Department responsible for the initiative who chaired each of the consultation sessions. Intersol also assisted with the design of materials and data capture tools such as the participant workbooks used to record the views of participants who attended the consultation sessions and other Canadians who could not. The data captured via these tools was then used to prepare the finding reports and ultimately, to develop a legislative proposal to renew the federal health protection legislation. There were multiple meeting dates and locations, including Halifax, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver, Yellowknife, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Whitehorse.<br>
<br>
Health Canada: Legislative Renewal - Phase 2<br>
In 2003, Intersol designed and facilitated a series of multi-stakeholder consultation workshops held across the country, the purpose of which was to obtain feedback on a proposal to renew the federal health protection legislation, that is, the laws aimed at addressing risks to health before they lead to injury or death. Intersol also worked with the secretariat to design the workshops that focused on the proposal generally, and designed several additional workshops that focused on specific themes contained in the proposal where greater discussion was required by informed stakeholders. Intersol designed the session report data capture tools used to assist participants in their discussions and to record their views.<br>
<br>
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC):  Housing and Homelessness Consultations <br>
As consultants to HRSDC and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), Intersol designed, facilitated and reported on a series of one day multi-stakeholder workshops in eleven cities across Canada, within a 5 week time span. Each event brought together approximately 50 to 100 Canadians representing various perspectives and interests of the population including citizens, industry leaders, special interest groups, academia, provincial government representatives and others.  Participants included the Minister, and a panel of senior government executives.  The purpose of the sessions was to provide an opportunity for representatives from community stakeholder groups to present in person, to a federal government panel, their input on the development of a new Canadian Housing framework. The Minister or delegate spoke at each of the sessions and responded to questions.<br>
<br>
Industry Canada: Consultation Blue Print<br>
On behalf of Industry Canada, Intersol developed the Industry Canada Consultation Blueprint.  This guide is intended for Operations Sector staff and managers at all levels who are interested in learning more about employee consultation and engagement and in designing and conducting consultations with employees.  The guide was developed in line with the key values and principles set out in the Public Service Labour Relations Act and with the values of the Operations Sector in mind.<br>
<br>
The tool enables staff, team leaders and managers of all levels to determine who should be consulted as well as gain a more thorough understanding of consultation.  The guide focuses specifically on the hows of consultation.  The roles of facilitator, team builder, negotiator, and diplomat were outside the scope of this initiative.  Intersol developed the guide in collaboration with Industry Canada representatives, leveraging Intersols core intellectual property on facilitation and best practices in consultation.<br>
<br>
Industry Canada: Competition Bureau Management Committee Retreat<br>
Intersol designed, facilitated and reported on the Bureau Management Committees retreat aimed at revising and improving the Bureaus planning cycle and priority setting process.  The objectives of the Bureau Management Committee Retreat were to lay the ground work for the establishment of a short term plan (1 to 2 years), identify high priority, high risk areas, provide opportunities to exchange information and develop new insights.  The retreat led to BMCs development of a draft planning cycle for the bureau as well as a draft plan that contained short term priorities and the elements of a strategic and operational plan. This project involved the facilitation of three small working sessions of 4 to 6 people culminating in a retreat involving over 40 Directors General, Directors and Deputy Commissioners.<br>
<br>
ING  Microsoft Partnering Workshop<br>
Over the course of 2004-2005, Intersol designed, developed, facilitated and reported on a partnering workshop with key executives from the ING Group (Banking and Insurance) and Microsoft Corporation (Software).  The Chief Executive Officers of both corporations had  expressed a desire to develop mutually beneficial business opportunities going beyond the traditional lines of a supplier-client relationship.  Intersol was brought into the project by the Chief Information Officer and the Managing Director for Wholesale Relationships of the ING group and we worked closely with the Microsoft Global Account Representative.  The Team quickly developed a Joint Business Development Approach, the central feature of which is a Think Tank, an idea incubator of sorts that identified, selected and developed innovative ideas related to products and services. Over the course of eight months, a program was assembled to prepare the forty-five participants for the Joint Business Development Framework Think Tank.  Intersol designed and facilitated the process by which Think Tank participants brainstormed, selected and defined ideas that would lead to new products and services beneficial to both businesses.  The Think Tank event took place September 24-30th, 2005.  At the conclusion of the Think Tank, over 25 ideas had been retained and were being further investigated by three distinct teams.  Throughout the project, Intersol facilitated numerous working sessions of executives from both firms.  Facilitated meetings were held in November and December 2004, February 2005, and subsequently on a monthly basis right up until the Think Tank event.<br>
<br>
Lac Carling Congress:  A Unique Annual Forum for Canadian CIOs<br>
The principal requirement of this CIO gathering was for the preparation, design, facilitation and reporting associated with the Lac Carling Congress.  Intersol has been involved in this capacity with Lac Carling Congress IV to X (2000-2005).  The Congress brings together two hundred and fifty CIO and private sector representatives into working sessions.  These working sessions are structured according to Intersols unique adaptation of sound large groups principles and methodologies.  Simply put, specific themes are identified, the content is framed for adequate scope, structured discussions are conducted, common discussion points are identified and the consensus view is then refined into a go forward strategy and related action plan that is the object of a report to subsequent Congresses.<br>
<br>
Ministers Roundtable for the Species at Risk Act (SARA), Environment Canada<br>
Over the course of nine months leading to December 2006, Intersol planned and facilitated the two-day Environment Ministers Roundtable. Participants included senior executives from the various stakeholders including First Nations, environmental organizations, industry, federal/provincial/territorial governments and others. The planning included engaging stakeholders in the development of the agenda.  The purpose of the roundtable was to generate recommendations for the Minister in the implementation of the Species at Risk Act.<br>
<br>

Intersol has worked with PSC since 2002.  At that time, Intersol was involved at the corporate level, helping the President and the management team through important change management initiatives.  In February 2002, the PSC Transformation/Modernization project and meeting.  In the spring of that same year, Intersol designed and facilitated a Workshop for Executives and Managers on a HR Modernization and Change Agenda.  In Oct 2003, Intersol facilitated an HR Modernization meeting to discuss a renewed PSC.  Intersol has also worked with different branches/groups:<br>
 PSC Recourse Branch in March 2003 (setting direction and identifying priorities)<br>
 Interdepartmental Group on Conflict Management in Nov 2002 (about identifying terms of reference and planning the work of the group)<br>
 Accountability Directorate; worked throughout 2005 to help improve the effectiveness of the management team and then at an all-staff meeting to identify ways of improving the work of the Directorate and the workplace.<br>

<br>
Transport Canada - Strategic Planning Workshop<br>
On June 7, 2006, Intersol led the strategic planning exercise for the Security and Emergency Preparedness Directorate of Transport Canada&#39;s Ontario Region.  The Directorate is responsible for regulating security operations across all modes of transportation in Ontario.  This includes ports, airports, bridges and tunnels. Intersol worked with the Directorate executive team to craft the strategic priorities against which resources would be focused the current and following fiscal year. The process centred on a series of two meetings.  The first Meeting focused on the environmental scanning process and identification of key result areas and recommended strategies.  The second meeting involved the validation of recommended strategies and the assignment of priorities for the recommended actions.
