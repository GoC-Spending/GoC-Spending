                            The vertical-axis 4Power Generator is the newest development of ELECTROSA Inc.<br>
<br>
It has no vibrations, infrasound and starts to rotate at 0 m/s wind speed, reaches nominal (rated/plate) power output at 5 m/s and unlike traditional turbines continues to generate more and more energy till wind speed reaches 80 m/s.<br>
<br>
It starts to generate electricity at very low wind speed, even if the wind speed is 0 m/s, it will still rotate with magnetic energy. You will have slow, but steady energy flow starting from 5 m/s. It also starts to generate almost the same amount of electricity out of solar energy from sunrise till sunset. When turbine starts to rotate, it will start to create and collect the static electric. So, this innovation uses 4 different natural energy sources to produce electricity. <br>
<br>
Simple, no-friction construction minimizes maintenance and repair downtime, increases life span and efficiency overall.   <br>

                            V-Count People Traffic Counter<br>
<br>
PEOPLE COUNTING:<br>
With an average of  96% counting accuracy, our most recent V-Count 3G people counting device is one of the best in the global market. It&#39;s also the only GSM ready (3G), &quot;plug and play&quot; hardware available; making it both efficient and easy to use. Moreover, being 3G, the people counting data will be transferred through your clients preferred local GSM operators, so the hassle of pulling network cables across locations will be eliminated. Making it very easy to set up. Of course our tech team will give you remote support and training for you to learn set up as well. <br>
Our people counting solutions are bidirectional. They can separate children and adults. They can also compare people traffic to the weather forecast on a daily basis, and show your clients whether there is any correlation in between their busier days and the weather. (These are all new features and only available with V-count)<br>
Not only that, we provide leading Cloud reporting services with each of our V-Count devices, that will enable your client to access all the measurements and comparisons they require. In fact, please log-in to our demo account to see for yourself and explore the wide range of reports we have to offer. You can also give me a call so we can go through the reports together one by one, so you are fully aware of all its capabilities... <br>
 <br>
We offer three different hardware models: <br>
<br>
                V-Count 2D requires‎ network cable only (power over Ethernet -PoE) so you need to run a cat5/cat6 cable from your router. <br>
                V-Count 2D+3G requires power connection only. It transfers data through a cellular wireless network just like your mobile phone. This is the first and only people counter in the world that doesn&#39;t require customer&#39;s internet access point.<br>
               V-Count 3D This new technology can calculate depth, and therefore can differentiate between adults and children as they pass under the counter. Not only that, this ground breaking device can work outdoors too, meaning it can count people in direct sunlight conditions and also on public transportation. V-Count 3D also presents the option to calculate those who pass by your stores, but don’t enter. It can do so by being mounted with a slight angle at the entrance, and thus can keep track of people passing by the window displays!<br>
<br>
Our hardware is very easy to install, does not require any special knowledge for physical installation and is calibrated remotely by our service team. We also have an online health-check service that monitors each device 24/7 and notifies you in case a problem occurs. <br>
<br>
Our differences: <br>
<br>
- The most accurate mono lens IP camera based people counter on the market even in low lightening and shady conditions, <br>
- Low device cost<br>
- Up to 15m working height<br>
- Flawless operation over the escalators.<br>

                            The vertical-axis 4Power Generator is the newest development of ELECTROSA Inc.<br>
<br>
It has no vibrations, infrasound and starts to rotate at 0 m/s wind speed, reaches nominal (rated/plate) power output at 5 m/s and unlike traditional turbines continues to generate more and more energy till wind speed reaches 80 m/s.<br>
<br>
It starts to generate electricity at very low wind speed, even if the wind speed is 0 m/s, it will still rotate with magnetic energy. You will have slow, but steady energy flow starting from 5 m/s. It also starts to generate almost the same amount of electricity out of solar energy from sunrise till sunset. When turbine starts to rotate, it will start to create and collect the static electric. So, this innovation uses 4 different natural energy sources to produce electricity. <br>
<br>
Simple, no-friction construction minimizes maintenance and repair downtime, increases life span and efficiency overall.   <br>

                            V-Count People Traffic Counter<br>
<br>
PEOPLE COUNTING:<br>
With an average of  96% counting accuracy, our most recent V-Count 3G people counting device is one of the best in the global market. It&#39;s also the only GSM ready (3G), &quot;plug and play&quot; hardware available; making it both efficient and easy to use. Moreover, being 3G, the people counting data will be transferred through your clients preferred local GSM operators, so the hassle of pulling network cables across locations will be eliminated. Making it very easy to set up. Of course our tech team will give you remote support and training for you to learn set up as well. <br>
Our people counting solutions are bidirectional. They can separate children and adults. They can also compare people traffic to the weather forecast on a daily basis, and show your clients whether there is any correlation in between their busier days and the weather. (These are all new features and only available with V-count)<br>
Not only that, we provide leading Cloud reporting services with each of our V-Count devices, that will enable your client to access all the measurements and comparisons they require. In fact, please log-in to our demo account to see for yourself and explore the wide range of reports we have to offer. You can also give me a call so we can go through the reports together one by one, so you are fully aware of all its capabilities... <br>
 <br>
We offer three different hardware models: <br>
<br>
                V-Count 2D requires‎ network cable only (power over Ethernet -PoE) so you need to run a cat5/cat6 cable from your router. <br>
                V-Count 2D+3G requires power connection only. It transfers data through a cellular wireless network just like your mobile phone. This is the first and only people counter in the world that doesn&#39;t require customer&#39;s internet access point.<br>
               V-Count 3D This new technology can calculate depth, and therefore can differentiate between adults and children as they pass under the counter. Not only that, this ground breaking device can work outdoors too, meaning it can count people in direct sunlight conditions and also on public transportation. V-Count 3D also presents the option to calculate those who pass by your stores, but don’t enter. It can do so by being mounted with a slight angle at the entrance, and thus can keep track of people passing by the window displays!<br>
<br>
Our hardware is very easy to install, does not require any special knowledge for physical installation and is calibrated remotely by our service team. We also have an online health-check service that monitors each device 24/7 and notifies you in case a problem occurs. <br>
<br>
Our differences: <br>
<br>
- The most accurate mono lens IP camera based people counter on the market even in low lightening and shady conditions, <br>
- Low device cost<br>
- Up to 15m working height<br>
- Flawless operation over the escalators.<br>
- Free Basic cloud service and web based reporting software V-Cloud<br>
- V-Cloud Premium package is complete reporting software with no limitations, no restrictions, no levels and at very low cost,<br>
- We are the designer of the software and the hardware. This makes us flexible for big projects,<br>
- We provide API and Web service SOAP Protocol. Easy adaptation into third party software.<br>
We also have our very own V-Count application available on IOS and Android which means your clients can follow up on Cloud reports from their Smartphone with ease. In fact, out application has a brand new feature that shows real time data of the number of people within a location. So it can calculate the entering and exiting visitors, and then tell you how many people are in your shopping mall in real time!! This is only available with V-Count and has been a huge success so far.  <br>
