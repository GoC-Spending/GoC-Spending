Computer modelling has been <br>performed for hundreds of buildings, and a formula for predicting the energy cost requirements for B.C. schools has been developed for the Ministry of Education. <br><br><br>BC Hydro Power Smart New Building Design Studies have been completed on The VEFRA Building (finalist for BC Hydro 1993 award), Lambrick Secondary School, Database Filetech <br>Building, Gateway Village, Nootka Court BCBC Lease Area, and Myra Systems. <br><br><br>BC Hydro Power Smart Building Improvement Studies have been completed on the Victoria Law Courts, The Butchart Gardens, Harbour Centre, Windsor Court, Tillicum Mall, <br>Mr.Grocer-Duncan, The Strathcona Gardens Recreation Centre, The Kerry Park Recreation Centre, Hartwig Court, and The Harbour House Hotel. <br><br><br>Other facilities which we have upgraded include Spectrum Community School (winner of the ASHRAE Technology Award for northwest North America in 1990), Victoria City Hall, <br>The Crystal Pool, Government House, and the Victoria Youth Detention Centre. <br><br><br>Full Energy Accounting services have been provided for the City of Victoria (3 years) and the School District of Greater Victoria (3 years). <br><br><br>Specifically, we have direct experience with the following technologies: Design of energy efficient building systems for numerous office buildings, schools, art galleries, museums, hotels, swimming pools, archives, greenhouses, commercial freezers, laboratories, restaurants, a ship repair unit, a movie theatre, warehouses and residences. <br><br><br>Computer (DDC) control of buildings including numerous office buildings, schools, 6 public pools, arena ice plants, commercial freezers, The Provincial Museum, greenhouses, laboratories, restaurants, numerous federal facilities, and an artifact storage facility. <br><br><br>Heat reclaim: a commercial laundry, public swimming pools, an artifact storage facility, a bowling alley, restaurants and residential buildings; adjustable speed drives, high efficiency motors, and synchronous belts in building HVAC systems.; numerous lighting retrofits for offices, malls, pools, restaurants, parking lots etc. ; complete conversion of steam to hot water space heating for the Pacific Forestry Centre, Royal Roads Recreation Centre, The Fairfield Health Centre, and the Naden Recreation Centre; conversion of numerous buildings from electric, propane and oil heat to natural gas; low emissivity ceilings, refrigerative reclaim dehumidifiers, and desiccant dehumidifiers; california Loop heat pump systems; greenhouse shade curtains at the Butchart Gardens; analysis and evaluation of various glazing types, and of architectural and mechanical insulation levels; design, installation and maintenance of District Heating systems and Combined Heat and Power systems; residential, industrial and commercial solar energy applications; cooling with lake water; biogas, photovoltaics, and Solarwall feasibility; computer energy simulations for hundreds of buildings; evaluation, testing, balancing and commissioning of numerous mechanical systems. <br><br><br>2. ENERGY RESEARCH: Avalon was one of six organizations (including Hydro Quebec and the University of Calgary) to produce reports (September &#39;98) concerning technologies which could reduce <br>Canadian greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030. This Energy Technologies Futures project output is used by Natural Resources Canada as a catalyst for immediate work on <br>energy systems, development of policy, and long term R&amp;D. <br><br><br>Avalon worked with a market research firm to provide BC Hydro with program evaluation of their New Building Design Program, and their Natural Choice Program in 1996. <br><br><br>Avalon provided the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, B.C. (MEMPR) with detailed critical evaluations of the National Research Council&#39;s National Energy Code <br>for Buildings (NECB), 1.0 and 2.0. We authored many revisions to the NECB which were adopted into the Code. In 1996, we provided the Canadian Government with a comprehensive <br>training plan (aimed at all Canadian trades, inspectors and design professionals) for implementation of the NECB. In 1997, we created Information Sheets (posters) concerning NECB <br>envelope, lighting and mechanical requirements. Avalon was the only Canadian consultant on the team which developed the performance simulation software for the NECB. <br><br><br>Solar energy feasibility studies have been conducted on the following Vancouver Island buildings: Government House, The Brannan Lake Correctional Centre, The Waddington <br>Building, The Richard Blanshard Building, and the Jack Davis Building. Monitoring of a solar assisted heat pump system has been performed on a large apartment building. We have <br>recently completed a study on solar systems in salmon hatcheries for Natural Resources Canada (CANMET). <br><br><br>The following are examples of technical documents produced by Avalon: Client: CMHC(Ottawa); Topic: West Coast Ventilation Strategies, published 1990; CMHC (Ottawa): Research Report on Air Leakage and Movement in BC High-rise Apartments, published 1991; CANMET (Ottawa): Site Evaluations and System; design for Solar Heating of Aquaculture Process Water , 1995; BCBC Energy Mgmt: Report on HVAC Fan Power Consumption in Government Buildings. 1993; BCBC Head Office: Corporate Air Filtration Guidelines and Specifications, 1989; Bassai Industries<br>Field-Verified Savings Associated with Low-Emissivity Ceilings, 1992; BCBC Energy Mgmt: Energy Saving Potential of Flue-Mounted Devices on Combustion Appliances, 1988; BCBC Environment:<br>Guidelines for Ozone Depleting Substances; Purchasing, and Maintenance. 1992; BCBC Energy Mgmt:<br>Guidelines for Window Selection in Commercial Buildings in BC., 1986; BCBC PMU #1: Detailed Window Replacement Evaluation for The Douglas Building; Energy, Maintenance, Aesthetics and Ventilation. 1994.<br><br><br>Current Standing Offers: Defence Construction Canada; Energy Innovators Initiative, Natural Resources Canada; The Victoria Airport Authority; NRCan CANMET Energy Technology Centre; New Building Institute.<br><br><br>3. INDOOR AIR QUALITY: Studies, including more than 50 Provincial Government buildings and 60 schools, have been performed, and recommended improvements have been implemented in most cases. More <br>than one million dollars worth of upgrades have been implemented in the BC Ministry of Health Building alone. <br><br><br>We have produced air filtration guidelines and generic specifications for The B.C. Buildings Corporation (B.C.B.C.), and have completed a two year research project concerning <br>residential ventilation for CMHC (Ottawa). Another research project on air leakage in BC high-rise apartments was completed for CMHC and published in the fall of 1991. <br><br><br>Avalon possesses computerized data acquisition equipment for CO2, CO, relative humidity, and temperature. Microbiological testing, radon, formaldehyde, ozone and hydrogen <br>sulphide testing have been performed on past projects. Questionnaires have been administered at numerous buildings.<br>

2.  ENERGY RESEARCH: Avalon was one of six organizations (including Hydro Quebec and the University of Calgary) to produce reports (September &#39;98) concerning technologies which could reduce Canadian greenhouse gas emissions by the<br>
year 2030.  This Energy Technologies Futures project output is used by Natural Resources Canada as a catalyst for immediate work on energy systems, development of policy, and long term R&amp;D.<br>
<br>
<br>
Avalon worked with a market research firm to provide BC Hydro with program evaluation of their New Building Design Program, and their Natural Choice Program in 1996.<br>
<br>
<br>
Avalon provided the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, B.C. (MEMPR) with detailed critical evaluations of the National Research Council&#39;s National Energy Code for Buildings (NECB), 1.0 and 2.0.  We<br>
authored many revisions to the NECB which were adopted into the Code.  In 1996, we provided the Canadian Government with a comprehensive training plan (aimed at all Canadian trades, inspectors and design professionals) for<br>
implementation of the NECB.  In 1997, we created Information Sheets (posters) concerning NECB envelope, lighting and mechanical requirements. Avalon was the only Canadian consultant on the team which developed the<br>
performance simulation software for the NECB.<br>
<br>
<br>
Solar energy feasibility studies have been conducted on the following Vancouver Island buildings: Government House, The Brannan Lake Correctional Centre, The Waddington Building, The Richard Blanshard Building, and the<br>
Jack Davis Building.  Monitoring of a solar assisted heat pump system has been performed on a large apartment building.  We have recently completed a study on solar systems in salmon hatcheries for Natural Resources Canada<br>
(CANMET).<br>

Studies, including more than 50 Provincial Government buildings and 60 schools, have been performed, and recommended improvements have been implemented in most cases.  More than one  million dollars worth of upgrades<br>
have been implemented in the BC Ministry of Health Building alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
We have produced air filtration guidelines and generic specifications for The B.C. Buildings Corporation (B.C.B.C.), and have completed a two year research project concerning residential ventilation for CMHC (Ottawa).<br>
Another research project on air leakage  in BC high-rise apartments was completed for CMHC and published in the fall of 1991.<br>

2.  ENERGY RESEARCH: Avalon was one of six organizations (including Hydro Quebec and the University of Calgary) to produce reports (September &#39;98) concerning technologies which could reduce Canadian greenhouse gas emissions by the<br>
year 2030.  This Energy Technologies Futures project output is used by Natural Resources Canada as a catalyst for immediate work on energy systems, development of policy, and long term R&amp;D.<br>
<br>
<br>
Avalon worked with a market research firm to provide BC Hydro with program evaluation of their New Building Design Program, and their Natural Choice Program in 1996.<br>
<br>
<br>
Avalon provided the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, B.C. (MEMPR) with detailed critical evaluations of the National Research Council&#39;s National Energy Code for Buildings (NECB), 1.0 and 2.0.  We<br>
authored many revisions to the NECB which were adopted into the Code.  In 1996, we provided the Canadian Government with a comprehensive training plan (aimed at all Canadian trades, inspectors and design professionals) for<br>
implementation of the NECB.  In 1997, we created Information Sheets (posters) concerning NECB envelope, lighting and mechanical requirements. Avalon was the only Canadian consultant on the team which developed the<br>
performance simulation software for the NECB.<br>
<br>
<br>
Solar energy feasibility studies have been conducted on the following Vancouver Island buildings: Government House, The Brannan Lake Correctional Centre, The Waddington Building, The Richard Blanshard Building, and the<br>
Jack Davis Building.  Monitoring of a solar assisted heat pump system has been performed on a large apartment building.  We have recently completed a study on solar systems in salmon hatcheries for Natural Resources Canada<br>
(CANMET).<br>
