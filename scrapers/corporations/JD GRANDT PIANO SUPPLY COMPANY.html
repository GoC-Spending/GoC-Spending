                            Steingraeber &amp; Söhne, is one of Germany&#39;s oldest existing piano builders, manufacturing in the handcrafted traditions of the original founding family members since 1852.  The small number of skilled craftsmen produce less than 150 pianos each year for the global market.  Steingraeber pianos are characterized by their almost magical and dream-like tonal qualities.  Unlike any other piano manufacturer, throughout the later 1800&#39;s Steingraeber was influenced not only by the emerging virtuoso piano performer (Franz Liszt being a regular visitor to the factory) but also with great attention to the &#39;voice&#39; generated by the instrument by way of the influence of one of histories most powerful opera composers, Richard Wagner.  Since 1852, the Steingraeber &amp; Söhne factory has been located in the Bavarian city of Bayreuth, home of Wagner&#39;s Festspielhaus and annual Wagner Festival.<br>

              &quot; your piano [Steingraeber] is what a piano should sound and feel like, totally unmatched by any other. The touch is exquisite, its tone awesome. I felt my right eye become slightly teary, a tear of pure happiness that I finally found a piano that fulfilled all my expectations&quot;<br>
(Aurora, ON)<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear Mr. Schienke,<br>
I want to again thank you for helping me sell my Yamaha U1 piano. Since you actually found the buyer, your help was the major factor. As we discussed, I bought the piano from your store in 1990. When I recently decided to move to a condominium, I realized the piano would not fit, so I decided to call you to see if you could help me. I received the same professional, courteous and helpful service I got 22 years ago, and again at a very reasonable price. It&#39;s easy to see why you have been in business for so long.<br>
<br>
My best regards,<br>
Mel&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; The J. D. Grandt stock set of Steinway L bass strings was received in just a few days. We thank you for the prompt delivery.<br>
The [competitors] bass strings in this Steinway L were only 11-or-12 years old but were getting more ugly and difficult to tune with each passing year. The partials of the shared pairs were becoming SO wildly dissimilar that it was no longer possible to accurately tune them together and it wasn&#39;t possible to hide the &quot;yammering&quot;. All we could do was compromise and &quot;pick-the-least-of-the-evils&quot;.<br>
<br>
This Steinway piano, located in the fellowship hall of Rochester&#39;s oldest church, directly across the street from the Mayo Clinic, is MUCH in demand for numerous student recitals. Fortunately there was a 6-day hiatus in the schedule starting at noon last Saturday.<br>
<br>
As soon as the recitals finished we began replacing the bass strings one-at-a-time to not disturb the overall tuning stability. Dampers were raised and blocked to clear strings. Your new strings were slid through the agraffes and coils were formed on a &quot;dummy pin&quot; and then slipped over the existing tuning pins that had been turned out no more than one-full-turn to minimize disturbing tightness of the pinblock. We followed your instructions regarding the half-twist of the hitch loop.<br>
<br>
As we removed each old string and installed your new string we could see obvious visual differences in the string scale. As we pulled each new string up-to-pitch and compared it with remaining old strings we were stunned by the tonal improvement and clean sound. The old strings were NOT &quot;dull&quot; but were full of disgusting &quot;yammering&quot; partials.<br>
<br>
Your stock set fit perfectly with a more even appearance than the ones we removed. The old strings had sharp tips of core wire protruding from the final turn of the hitch end that always snagged cleaning cloths. Your new strings have beautifully finished hitch ends with NO protruding tips of core wire to snag cleaning cloths.<br>
<br>
The clarity and fullness of your J.D. GRANDT bass strings is astonishingly different and far superior to the strings we removed. It&#39;s as if we added another half-a-foot to the length of the piano -!!! The lowest bass now has clean-&amp;-clear partials that sound more like the strings of a 9-foot. Best-of-all the partials of the shared pairs AGREE and are easily tuned together with NO &quot;yammering&quot;.<br>
<br>
We will be retuning the new bass strings several times this week and will give the piano a full tuning close to the next scheduled student recitals which begin next weekend.<br>
<br>
The members of our local PTG (Piano Technicians Guild) weren&#39;t familiar with Canadian J.D. GRANDT bass strings. At our next meeting (August) I will make a presentation as part of &quot;new ventures-&amp;-wonders&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
THANKS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT WORK -!!!<br>
Minnesota<br>
<br>
&quot; Thanks so much for the strings for the Steinway B which you made for me this summer. You also re scaled the piano and it sounds so much better than it did. Is there anyway you can send me the file with the changes you made? It was called B1986 I think. &quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks so much<br>

The small number of skilled craftsmen produce less than 150 pianos each year for the global market.  Steingraeber pianos are characterized by their almost magical and dream-like tonal qualities.  Unlike any other piano manufacturer, throughout the later 1800&#39;s Steingraeber was influenced not only by the emerging virtuoso piano performer (Franz Liszt being a regular visitor to the factory) but also with great attention to the &#39;voice&#39; generated by the instrument by way of the influence of one of histories most powerful opera composers, Richard Wagner.  Since 1852, the Steingraeber &amp; Söhne factory has been located in the Bavarian city of Bayreuth, home of Wagner&#39;s Festspielhaus and annual Wagner Festival.<br>

              &quot; your piano [Steingraeber] is what a piano should sound and feel like, totally unmatched by any other. The touch is exquisite, its tone awesome. I felt my right eye become slightly teary, a tear of pure happiness that I finally found a piano that fulfilled all my expectations&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Dear Mr. Schienke,<br>
I want to again thank you for helping me sell my Yamaha U1 piano. Since you actually found the buyer, your help was the major factor. As we discussed, I bought the piano from your store in 1990. When I recently decided to move to a condominium, I realized the piano would not fit, so I decided to call you to see if you could help me. I received the same professional, courteous and helpful service I got 22 years ago, and again at a very reasonable price. It&#39;s easy to see why you have been in business for so long.<br>
<br>
My best regards,<br>
Mel&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; The J. D. Grandt stock set of Steinway L bass strings was received in just a few days. We thank you for the prompt delivery.<br>
The [competitors] bass strings in this Steinway L were only 11-or-12 years old but were getting more ugly and difficult to tune with each passing year. The partials of the shared pairs were becoming SO wildly dissimilar that it was no longer possible to accurately tune them together and it wasn&#39;t possible to hide the &quot;yammering&quot;. All we could do was compromise and &quot;pick-the-least-of-the-evils&quot;.<br>
<br>
This Steinway piano, located in the fellowship hall of Rochester&#39;s oldest church, directly across the street from the Mayo Clinic, is MUCH in demand for numerous student recitals. Fortunately there was a 6-day hiatus in the schedule starting at noon last Saturday.<br>
<br>
As soon as the recitals finished we began replacing the bass strings one-at-a-time to not disturb the overall tuning stability. Dampers were raised and blocked to clear strings. Your new strings were slid through the agraffes and coils were formed on a &quot;dummy pin&quot; and then slipped over the existing tuning pins that had been turned out no more than one-full-turn to minimize disturbing tightness of the pinblock. We followed your instructions regarding the half-twist of the hitch loop.<br>
<br>
As we removed each old string and installed your new string we could see obvious visual differences in the string scale. As we pulled each new string up-to-pitch and compared it with remaining old strings we were stunned by the tonal improvement and clean sound. The old strings were NOT &quot;dull&quot; but were full of disgusting &quot;yammering&quot; partials.<br>
<br>
Your stock set fit perfectly with a more even appearance than the ones we removed. The old strings had sharp tips of core wire protruding from the final turn of the hitch end that always snagged cleaning cloths. Your new strings have beautifully finished hitch ends with NO protruding tips of core wire to snag cleaning cloths.<br>
<br>
The clarity and fullness of your J.D. GRANDT bass strings is astonishingly different and far superior to the strings we removed. It&#39;s as if we added another half-a-foot to the length of the piano -!!! The lowest bass now has clean-&amp;-clear partials that sound more like the strings of a 9-foot. Best-of-all the partials of the shared pairs AGREE and are easily tuned together with NO &quot;yammering&quot;.<br>
<br>
We will be retuning the new bass strings several times this week and will give the piano a full tuning close to the next scheduled student recitals which begin next weekend.<br>
<br>
The members of our local PTG (Piano Technicians Guild) weren&#39;t familiar with Canadian J.D. GRANDT bass strings. At our next meeting (August) I will make a presentation as part of &quot;new ventures-&amp;-wonders&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
THANKS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT WORK -!!!<br>
Minnesota<br>
<br>
&quot; Thanks so much for the strings for the Steinway B which you made for me this summer. You also re scaled the piano and it sounds so much better than it did. Is there anyway you can send me the file with the changes you made? It was called B1986 I think. &quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks so much<br>
