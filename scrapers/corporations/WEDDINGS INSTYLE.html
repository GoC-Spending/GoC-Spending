              We received nothing but the best service. <br>
They were very caring, understanding, convenient and accommodating to ALL of our needs and wants. When they say they can do it, they do it and if they say they can&#39;t, they do their absolute best to try to get it for you. We received the utmost quality in ALL the services they provided. <br>
They make you feel as if you are the first and ONLY wedding they have ever planned and/or preformed. <br>
I think they were just as excited about helping us make our dreams come true as we were about having them on our special day. <br>

5 ***** stars!<br>

My husband and I had our wedding ceremony at Weddings InStyle on March 30, 2013. We were looking for an intimate venue in the downtown Ottawa area for our small wedding, which was just 17 guests in total. We fell in love with Weddings InStyle right from the get-go. Their event space is modern, clean and offers a great alternative for couples like us looking for an intimate space. They were also able and willing to work with our tight time lines; we booked our wedding date with them just 5 weeks in advance! <br>
<br>
The staff are all extremely professional and friendly. They respond to e-mails and inquiries very quickly, and they were more than happy to answer all of our many, many questions. We had our wedding planner, Jillienne, officiate our wedding, and we couldn&#39;t have been more pleased with everything that she did for us. She took care of the flowers (bridal bouquet and groom&#39;s boutonniere) which were perfect and budget friendly. She also referred us to a photographer (Findley FOTO) who we adored, and we couldn&#39;t be more thrilled with our photos. The ceremony was exactly what we wanted. We can&#39;t say enough how impressed we were with Weddings InStyle. <br>
<br>
Thank you so much to the Weddings InStyle team for making our wedding day a dream come true, and a day that we will never forget!<br>

I cannot stress enough how awesome Jill and Weddings InStyle were to us. She was so friendly and helpful, always ready to offer suggestions and advice. My husband and I opted for a -very- small and short ceremony/reception and there was no problem at all with our desire to break from tradition. Between the time we met her and the final time we visited to receive our photos, Jill was so supportive and friendly; we were in constant contact by email, and it was no problem to stop by and drop off papers and cheques. <br>
<br>
Jill dealt with most things and the vendors she contacted were wonderful; my flowers were gorgeous and exactly as I&#39;d pictured them, and Bonnie the photographer was so talented and knowledgeable and nice. There was very little stress on our end - the hardest things we had to do were to show up on time and look pretty. The venue was tasteful and elegant when we arrived and the ceremony itself was lovely and it felt like we had a genuine friend guiding us through it and wishing us well. I would absolutely recommend Weddings InStyle to anyone wanting a beautiful, stress-free wedding handled by someone they could trust and I would also gladly contract with them again for other (non-wedding) events.<br>

Weddings InStyle is to be commended for the great services they provide. Our wedding was perfect. The venue was beautifully decorated and very elegant representating Ray and I. It was a very emotional ceremony performed by Weddings InStyle. We definitely recommand Weddings InStyle for a worry free wedding. <br>

Weddings InStyle is fantastic! With two young children we were looking for a stress free experience, and that&#39;s exactly what Jill and Amanda gave us. Working closely with Jill in the planning phase was a dream. She took care of the caterers (food was awesome), and flowers (they were STUNNING!!!!). She set us up with a great DJ and an awesome photographer, as well two wonderful ladies for hair and makeup. Jill was so flexible about whatever we wanted and how we wanted it done. We received so many compliments at our reception (and afterwards) about how beautiful the venue is, how beautifully Jill officiated our ceremony, the food, the music, the flowers. The night of the wedding Amanada was so wonderful with whatever we needed. There was not one aspect of our wedding and reception that we were disappointed with. Our wedding was everything we dreamed of and we thank Jill and Amanda at Weddings InStyle for that!<br>

              We received nothing but the best service. <br>
They were very caring, understanding, convenient and accommodating to ALL of our needs and wants. When they say they can do it, they do it and if they say they can&#39;t, they do their absolute best to try to get it for you. We received the utmost quality in ALL the services they provided. <br>
They make you feel as if you are the first and ONLY wedding they have ever planned and/or preformed. <br>
I think they were just as excited about helping us make our dreams come true as we were about having them on our special day. <br>
<br>
5 ***** stars!<br>

My husband and I had our wedding ceremony at Weddings InStyle on March 30, 2013. We were looking for an intimate venue in the downtown Ottawa area for our small wedding, which was just 17 guests in total. We fell in love with Weddings InStyle right from the get-go. Their event space is modern, clean and offers a great alternative for couples like us looking for an intimate space. They were also able and willing to work with our tight time lines; we booked our wedding date with them just 5 weeks in advance! <br>
<br>
The staff are all extremely professional and friendly. They respond to e-mails and inquiries very quickly, and they were more than happy to answer all of our many, many questions. We had our wedding planner, Jillienne, officiate our wedding, and we couldn&#39;t have been more pleased with everything that she did for us. She took care of the flowers (bridal bouquet and groom&#39;s boutonniere) which were perfect and budget friendly. She also referred us to a photographer (Findley FOTO) who we adored, and we couldn&#39;t be more thrilled with our photos. The ceremony was exactly what we wanted. We can&#39;t say enough how impressed we were with Weddings InStyle. <br>
<br>
Thank you so much to the Weddings InStyle team for making our wedding day a dream come true, and a day that we will never forget!<br>

I cannot stress enough how awesome Jill and Weddings InStyle were to us. She was so friendly and helpful, always ready to offer suggestions and advice. My husband and I opted for a -very- small and short ceremony/reception and there was no problem at all with our desire to break from tradition. Between the time we met her and the final time we visited to receive our photos, Jill was so supportive and friendly; we were in constant contact by email, and it was no problem to stop by and drop off papers and cheques. <br>
<br>
Jill dealt with most things and the vendors she contacted were wonderful; my flowers were gorgeous and exactly as I&#39;d pictured them, and Bonnie the photographer was so talented and knowledgeable and nice. There was very little stress on our end - the hardest things we had to do were to show up on time and look pretty. The venue was tasteful and elegant when we arrived and the ceremony itself was lovely and it felt like we had a genuine friend guiding us through it and wishing us well. I would absolutely recommend Weddings InStyle to anyone wanting a beautiful, stress-free wedding handled by someone they could trust and I would also gladly contract with them again for other (non-wedding) events.<br>

Weddings InStyle is to be commended for the great services they provide. Our wedding was perfect. The venue was beautifully decorated and very elegant representating Ray and I. It was a very emotional ceremony performed by Weddings InStyle. We definitely recommand Weddings InStyle for a worry free wedding. <br>

Weddings InStyle is fantastic! With two young children we were looking for a stress free experience, and that&#39;s exactly what Jill and Amanda gave us. Working closely with Jill in the planning phase was a dream. She took care of the caterers (food was awesome), and flowers (they were STUNNING!!!!). She set us up with a great DJ and an awesome photographer, as well two wonderful ladies for hair and makeup. Jill was so flexible about whatever we wanted and how we wanted it done. We received so many compliments at our reception (and afterwards) about how beautiful the venue is, how beautifully Jill officiated our ceremony, the food, the music, the flowers. The night of the wedding Amanada was so wonderful with whatever we needed. There was not one aspect of our wedding and reception that we were disappointed with. Our wedding was everything we dreamed of and we thank Jill and Amanda at Weddings InStyle for that!<br>
