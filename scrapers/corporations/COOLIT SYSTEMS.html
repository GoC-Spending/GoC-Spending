                            CoolIT Systems’ Rack DCLC™ platform is a modular, rack-based and advanced cooling solution that allows for dramatic increases in rack densities, component performance, and energy efficiencies. The technology can be deployed with any server and in any rack, making it a truly flexible solution which allows for an edge in today&#39;s highly competitive marketplaces. <br>
<br>
Rack DCLC utilizes a three-module, “building block” approach: Server Module, Manifold Module, and Heat Exchange Module. Data centers are diverse in their setups, and the appropriate heat rejection method may vary: CoolIT’s modules include CHx (Liquid -to-Liquid), AHx (Liquid-to-Air) and custom options. Installations are endlessly scalable, easy to maintain and service, and accommodate any environmental condition. All CoolIT Systems solutions are safe to use due to leak-free, dry-break technology.<br>

<br>
CoolIT’s Closed-Loop solutions are cooling systems that exist entirely within the desktop or server. A variety of efficient Coldplate Assemblies are installed next to heat-producing components and hot air is then rejected through slim, quiet radiators. The sealed liquid loops ship pre-filled with coolant and installation is comparable to that of a standard heat sink. Many types of Closed-Loop systems are available to both standard and custom rack-mount configurations.<br>
<br>
 World-renowned Original Equipment Manufacturers such as Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise choose CoolIT Closed-Loop liquid cooled editions of their High Performance servers. <br>

            Patented Split-Flow Coldplates<br>
<br>
A key component of the Server Module, CoolIT Systems’ patented Split-Flow coldplates are solid copper components which deliver superior performance for today’s high thermal density processors. <br>
<br>
The Split-Flow design uses microchannel architecture to minimize pressure drop, maximize coolant flow, and direct the coolest liquid to the hottest area of the processor first. At only 2.4mm in height, coldplates are easily integrated into extremely compact, low-profile blade architectures, and allow for optimal performance in very thermally dense cooling applications.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center: <br>
<br>
The Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC) of Poland issued a public tender to cool its High Performance Computing (HPC) center, which provides HPC resources for scientific research, businesses and public institutions. In early 2015, CoolIT Systems partnered with Huawei and installed three racks at PSNC cooled by Direct Contact Liquid Cooling (DCLC). During the first project at PSNC, CoolIT installed three Rack DCLC™ CHx40 Modules: liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers which utilize centralized pumping architecture and manage over 40kW of heat load per rack with warm water cooling. <br>
<br>
In the summer of 2015, the extremely hot Polish weather caused an almost total system failure. This temporary shutdown affected every air-cooled rack; but CoolIT’s liquid cooled rack continued to function normally. This prompted PSNC to invest in a full-scale roll out of CoolIT Systems solutions.  <br>
<br>
CoolIT was contracted to install a much larger system for PSNC’s new 1.4 petaFLOPS supercomputer, “Eagle.” Two CoolIT Systems CHx650 Heat Exchange Modules were selected to handle 1,032 servers across 17 racks utilizing 40°C hot water. <br>
<br>
Since PNSC prides itself on innovative and environmental identity, is it fitting that the energy removed from the computing components is able to be reused to heat nearby campus buildings. Operating expenses are lowered in conjunction with carbon emissions, making Eagle one of the most powerful yet energy efficient supercomputers in the European Union. PSNC now benefits from an extremely dense data center that is easily maintained and scalable. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Center for Biological Sequence Analysis at the Technical University of Denmark: <br>
<br>
The Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) at the Technical University of Denmark is striving towards CO2 neutrality in its High Performance Computing facility known as “Computerome.” CBS made it a mission to achieve this computational performance as efficiently as possible. CoolIT accepted the challenge and delivered a liquid cooled, modular data center setup that not only dramatically lowers the energy consumed for cooling, but also provides a workable system to recycle the waste heat energy produced by the servers and captured in coolant. <br>
<br>
The solution replaced traditional air cooling equipment with warm water cooling. A centralized pumping Rack DCLC™ CHx40 Heat Exchange Module cools over 16,000 chips which process at up to 563 gigaFLOPS at peak performance. The system distributes liquid directly across the processors into stainless steel manifolds which use all metal, dry-break quick disconnects. These 100% leak-free connectors safe-guard against drips and leaks, which is vital for this valuable system that originally ranked 235 of the Top500 most powerful supercomputers on the planet. <br>
<br>
CoolIT enabled CBS to recover waste heat energy by routing high temperature liquid from the servers to provide heat for the adjacent campus buildings and the nearby town of Roskilde. With this installation, The Technical University of Denmark has more than achieved their initial efficiency goals for Computerome.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Intel Cherry Creek Cluster supercomputer: <br>
<br>
In 2013, Intel contacted CoolIT with a very ambitious goal of collaborating on a Top500 Supercomputer. The project was particularly special, as this system was to fit in two standard racks, run on a popular Supermicro form-factor and was going to run, fully loaded, on the floor at the 2013 Supercomputing Conference. <br>
<br>
Intel was interested in a Direct Contact Liquid Cooling (DCLC™) solution because the supercomputer was running very hot and the Top500 submission deadline was fast approaching. The system needed to manage 6000W of processing power. CoolIT created a specialized design that runs liquid inside the server nodes and utilizes one of CoolIT’s modular, self-contained Liquid-to-Air Heat Exchange Modules. <br>
The innovative and flexible technology combined with the phenomenal efforts from all those involved in hardware, logistics, software and coordination resulted a rank of 400 on the Top500, and a very impressive rank of 41 on the Green500, consuming less than 75kW of power. The system ran flawlessly for the duration of the SC13 show. <br>
<br>
The creation of Cherry Creek proved that a world-class supercomputer can be assembled using readily available, off-the-shelf components. By leveraging DCLC, the system was fast, cool, quiet and very environmentally friendly.

                            CoolIT Systems’ Rack DCLC™ platform is a modular, rack-based and advanced cooling solution that allows for dramatic increases in rack densities, component performance, and energy efficiencies. The technology can be deployed with any server and in any rack, making it a truly flexible solution which allows for an edge in today&#39;s highly competitive marketplaces. <br>
<br>
Rack DCLC utilizes a three-module, “building block” approach: Server Module, Manifold Module, and Heat Exchange Module. Data centers are diverse in their setups, and the appropriate heat rejection method may vary: CoolIT’s modules include CHx (Liquid -to-Liquid), AHx (Liquid-to-Air) and custom options. Installations are endlessly scalable, easy to maintain and service, and accommodate any environmental condition. All CoolIT Systems solutions are safe to use due to leak-free, dry-break technology.<br>

<br>
CoolIT’s Closed-Loop solutions are cooling systems that exist entirely within the desktop or server. A variety of efficient Coldplate Assemblies are installed next to heat-producing components and hot air is then rejected through slim, quiet radiators. The sealed liquid loops ship pre-filled with coolant and installation is comparable to that of a standard heat sink. Many types of Closed-Loop systems are available to both standard and custom rack-mount configurations.<br>
<br>
 World-renowned Original Equipment Manufacturers such as Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise choose CoolIT Closed-Loop liquid cooled editions of their High Performance servers. <br>

            Patented Split-Flow Coldplates<br>
<br>
A key component of the Server Module, CoolIT Systems’ patented Split-Flow coldplates are solid copper components which deliver superior performance for today’s high thermal density processors. <br>
<br>
The Split-Flow design uses microchannel architecture to minimize pressure drop, maximize coolant flow, and direct the coolest liquid to the hottest area of the processor first. At only 2.4mm in height, coldplates are easily integrated into extremely compact, low-profile blade architectures, and allow for optimal performance in very thermally dense cooling applications.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center: <br>
<br>
The Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC) of Poland issued a public tender to cool its High Performance Computing (HPC) center, which provides HPC resources for scientific research, businesses and public institutions. In early 2015, CoolIT Systems partnered with Huawei and installed three racks at PSNC cooled by Direct Contact Liquid Cooling (DCLC). During the first project at PSNC, CoolIT installed three Rack DCLC™ CHx40 Modules: liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers which utilize centralized pumping architecture and manage over 40kW of heat load per rack with warm water cooling. <br>
<br>
In the summer of 2015, the extremely hot Polish weather caused an almost total system failure. This temporary shutdown affected every air-cooled rack; but CoolIT’s liquid cooled rack continued to function normally. This prompted PSNC to invest in a full-scale roll out of CoolIT Systems solutions.  <br>
<br>
CoolIT was contracted to install a much larger system for PSNC’s new 1.4 petaFLOPS supercomputer, “Eagle.” Two CoolIT Systems CHx650 Heat Exchange Modules were selected to handle 1,032 servers across 17 racks utilizing 40°C hot water. <br>
<br>
Since PNSC prides itself on innovative and environmental identity, is it fitting that the energy removed from the computing components is able to be reused to heat nearby campus buildings. Operating expenses are lowered in conjunction with carbon emissions, making Eagle one of the most powerful yet energy efficient supercomputers in the European Union. PSNC now benefits from an extremely dense data center that is easily maintained and scalable. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Center for Biological Sequence Analysis at the Technical University of Denmark: <br>
<br>
The Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) at the Technical University of Denmark is striving towards CO2 neutrality in its High Performance Computing facility known as “Computerome.” CBS made it a mission to achieve this computational performance as efficiently as possible. CoolIT accepted the challenge and delivered a liquid cooled, modular data center setup that not only dramatically lowers the energy consumed for cooling, but also provides a workable system to recycle the waste heat energy produced by the servers and captured in coolant. <br>
<br>
The solution replaced traditional air cooling equipment with warm water cooling. A centralized pumping Rack DCLC™ CHx40 Heat Exchange Module cools over 16,000 chips which process at up to 563 gigaFLOPS at peak performance. The system distributes liquid directly across the processors into stainless steel manifolds which use all metal, dry-break quick disconnects. These 100% leak-free connectors safe-guard against drips and leaks, which is vital for this valuable system that originally ranked 235 of the Top500 most powerful supercomputers on the planet. <br>
<br>
CoolIT enabled CBS to recover waste heat energy by routing high temperature liquid from the servers to provide heat for the adjacent campus buildings and the nearby town of Roskilde. With this installation, The Technical University of Denmark has more than achieved their initial efficiency goals for Computerome.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Intel Cherry Creek Cluster supercomputer: <br>
<br>
In 2013, Intel contacted CoolIT with a very ambitious goal of collaborating on a Top500 Supercomputer. The project was particularly special, as this system was to fit in two standard racks, run on a popular Supermicro form-factor and was going to run, fully loaded, on the floor at the 2013 Supercomputing Conference. <br>
<br>
Intel was interested in a Direct Contact Liquid Cooling (DCLC™) solution because the supercomputer was running very hot and the Top500 submission deadline was fast approaching. The system needed to manage 6000W of processing power. CoolIT created a specialized design that runs liquid inside the server nodes and utilizes one of CoolIT’s modular, self-contained Liquid-to-Air Heat Exchange Modules. <br>
The innovative and flexible technology combined with the phenomenal efforts from all those involved in hardware, logistics, software and coordination resulted a rank of 400 on the Top500, and a very impressive rank of 41 on the Green500, consuming less than 75kW of power. The system ran flawlessly for the duration of the SC13 show. <br>
<br>
The creation of Cherry Creek proved that a world-class supercomputer can be assembled using readily available, off-the-shelf components. By leveraging DCLC, the system was fast, cool, quiet and very environmentally friendly.
