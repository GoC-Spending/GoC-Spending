<br>
Supply, Demand and Prices of Refinery Feedstocks and Products<br>
<br>
	Extensive data bases<br>
<br>
	Our extensive date bases help us provide data, analysis, and forecasts on issues of special relevance to petroleum companies.  ECT maintains a historical data base of crude oil, petroleum product, and petrochemical prices and related economic statistics that are key elements in our proprietary price forecasting methodologies.  <br>
	<br>
	ECT can provide a range of crude oil supply, demand, and price forecasts linked to selected economic scenarios, and petroleum product price forecasts for some base case (e.g. for Houston, Rotterdam, Singapore, etc.)  <br>
<br>
<br>
Supply, Demand, and Price Differentials for High-Quality Crude Oils.<br>
<br>
	To assist an oil company assess its competitive position relative to other producers, current ECT consultants estimated:<br>
<br>
- The demand for light, low-sulfur (LLS) crude oil in major markets, especially the United States, and the price premium--compared to lower quality oils--that LLS crude is likely to command in those markets<br>
<br>
- Potential supplies of LLS crude oil, by company and region.<br>
<br>
	We also identified and evaluated strategic options for improving the company&#39;s competitive position and profitability in upstream operations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Evaluation of Hydroisomerization Technology<br>
<br>
	To assist a South American oil company select a butadiene hydroisomerization process for one of its refineries, ECT consultants requested and evaluated process disclosures from 4 licensors. We evaluated the process economics, commercial experience, and contractual terms for each technology and recommended a licensor to the company.<br>
<br>
<br>
Evaluation of Processes and Licensors for a New Refinery<br>
<br>
	To assist a national oil company select process licensors for a new refinery, ECT consultants:<br>
<br>
-	Analyzed refinery material balances, product qualities, and stream compositions for use in the preparation of &quot;Invitations to Bid&quot; for each of the potential process licensors<br>
<br>
-	Prepared technical and economic analyses of the information contained in the proposals received from licensors<br>
<br>
-	Ranked the process licensors, and recommended the best licensors for each process<br>
<br>
-	Assembled the licensor information and the project analyses into a document that could be used by the basic engineering consultant.<br>
<br>
Profitability Analysis<br>
<br>
	Profitability of an Asian Oil Refinery<br>
<br>
	ECT consultants used its price projection system to estimate future profit margins for an Asian oil refinery.  We estimated product slates, product qualities, operating costs, and refinery margins for processing 7 different crude oils.  We also evaluated the effect on product slates and margins of installing new process units.<br>
<br>
<br>
Economic Feasibility of Petroleum Coke-Fired Power Generation.<br>
<br>
	To determine if power generation would provide a greater net-back for  petroleum coke than export arrangements, ECT consultants evaluated the economic feasibility of building and operating a petroleum coke-fired, independent power plant at a petroleum refinery.   The study included analyses of alternative power plant technologies (e.g., pulverized coke, fluidized bed, coke gasification/combined cycle), construction and operating costs, power purchase opportunities, and environmental requirements.  An objective of the study was the early identification of technical, economic, environmental, or regulatory constraints that might preclude the construction of such a plant.<br>

REPRESENTATIVE SINGLE-CLIENT PROJECTS IN PETROCHEMICALS<br>
<br>
<br>
EXAMPLES OF RECENT PEMEX PROJECTS<br>
<br>
   Our team of consultants have participated in the past few years in developing studies for Pemex Petroquímica during the process of privatization/capitalization of the various complexes. A list of some of these projects and studies can be detailed upon request.<br>
<br>
   Besides the comprehensive consulting engagement, we have developed many other projects during the past years. Some examples include:<br>
<br>
<br>
Etileno XXI Project: 2008-09<br>
<br>
The Government of Mexico and Pemex Gas requested our services to provide assistance during the promotion of a new private sector grass-roots investment in a petrochemical complex to be developed in Mexico. <br>
<br>
<br>
Pemex Petroquimicas Polyethylenes Business Plan 2005<br>
<br>
<br>
Pemex Petroquimicas Aromatics Business Plan 2006<br>
<br>
<br>
Pemex Petroquímicas Business Plan 2000<br>
<br>
     Pemex Petroquímica (PPQ) was preparing a business plan to guide its future. Recent efforts to attract investors have not succeeded, and the company needed to strengthen its position to fulfill its corporate mission; moreover, pivotal investments deferred during the capitalization process needed to be resumed. At the same time, changes in the marketplace in recent years needed to be accounted for in a new business plan. <br>
<br>
     The business plan documented the corporate mission and goals of the company as it was then structured and presented a blueprint for its future direction. The business plan incorporated the strategic intent of the company and provided the framework for tactical decisions needed to maintain the competitiveness of its products and services in an increasingly competitive and transparent business environment in Mexico.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feasibility Study for a Polyethylene Complex<br>
<br>
     For the Republic of Bolivia, the study reviewed the markets and defined the product slate for a pro¬posed polyethylene venture, and assessed polyethylene technologies to select the most ap¬propriate. The study then estimated investment requirements and production costs for the ethylene plant, polyethy¬lene plant, and utilities and storage.<br>
<br>
Feasibility Study for an Ethylene Complex<br>
<br>
     For a major chemical company, we compared the strengths and weaknesses of S.F. Braun technology with those of Technip/KTI and other licensers.<br>
<br>
Review of Global Supply/Demand for Aromatics Products <br>
<br>
     For an Indonesian chemical company, the projects study addressed the following topics:<br>
	Global capacity trends for a ten years period, including regional summaries and plant-by-plant capacity listing for benzene, toluene, o-xylene, p-xylene, and cyclo¬hexane.<br>
	Key issues affecting the free world supply/demand for each of the aromatics products (i.e., global and regional demand growth rates, operating rates, likely regional trade balances, and important changes expected in sources of supply).<br>
	Recent price trends in benzene, toluene, o-xylene, and p-xylene.<br>
<br>
A Competitive Review of a Chemicals Company <br>
<br>
     The study involved a competitive review of a major chemical company, with the ultimate goal of an¬swering the question:  Why is this company successful? This review formed part of a study the client was conducting about the ways in which the chemicals operations of other companies achieve and sustain their competitive advantage, with emphasis on financial performance as a mea¬sure of competitive success.<br>
<br>
   The review consisted of three parts:<br>
Portfolio Review<br>
	Review of corporate structure and strategies<br>
	Preparation of market attractiveness/business position matrices<br>
	Description of product lines<br>
<br>
<br>
Financial Review<br>
	Corporate overview<br>
	Product line analysis<br>
- Revenues<br>
- Income<br>
- Profitability<br>
- Cash flow<br>
<br>
Identification of Sources of Competitive Advantage<br>
	By-product line<br>
	Corporate.<br>
<br>
     The portfolio review provided a qualitative assessment of the companys business, and was primarily based on a review of historical strategic tactics; development of market attractiveness/business position matrices; and a general review of proprietary files and publicly available lit¬erature on the company.<br>
<br>
     The financial review tasks provided detailed quantitative estimates of product-by-product sales and operating profits, as well as product line estimates for cash flow, identifiable assets, net investment, and net income/net investment ratios for the company. Financial results for the chemicals operations were also placed in context with the performance for all company operations. Finally, the financial results of the companys and the clients chemical operations were compared.<br>
<br>
     These findings were then integrated into a qualitative assessment of the sources of competitive advantage for each product line. Generalizations about the sources of overall competitive advantage and about the companys strategy also resulted from comparing the individual product line strategies and results. The conclusions for each major product line were presented in a series of product profiles, which included brief reviews of product operations, integration, technology, and business positions, as well as discussions of the factors most important to the companys current success (position) in the product line and the outlook for the next 5 years.<br>
<br>
Overseas Market Analysis for Hong Kongs Plastic Producers <br>
<br>
     As part of its efforts to provide various sectors of Hong Kong industry with up-to-date infor¬mation on advancing technology and overseas markets, the Industry Department of the Hong Kong Government commissioned a study to analyze the North American and Western European markets for a number of categories of plastic products, such as toys, luggage, and small appliances.<br>
<br>
     The consultants prepared a series of profiles of plastics end-use markets in North America and Western Europe. The profiles described the market situations of these products, defined key business re¬quirements for participation in individual national markets for various categories, and identified promising opportunities among the numerous product niches in which Hong Kong manufacturers could compete. The consultants also performed an in-depth analysis of Hong Kongs largest plastics export market, toys. The consultants analyzed the North American and Western European toy markets and then wrote the marketing sections of the Industry Departments Blue Book, entitled Hong Kongs Toy In¬dus¬try.<br>
<br>
Feasibility Study Update for an NGL Based Petrochemical Complex<br>
<br>
     For a South American petrochemical complex, we evaluated a complex producing NGLs, ethylene and low-pressure polyethylene. We reviewed market/grade/technology considerations for polyethylene; estimated investment and production costs for the complex based on two alternative locations; and projected prices and profitability. Because of their relevance to pricing negotiations, we placed emphasis on projecting prices for the products from the complex, and on examining the impact of alternative assumptions on project profitability.<br>
<br>
Markets and Production Costs for a Primary Petrochemical<br>
<br>
     The client, a large European chemical group, wished to decide whether to produce a large-vol¬ume primary petrochemical. The project team contributed to the clients prefeasibility study by providing:<br>
	Market data<br>
	Elements for selecting a suitable plant site<br>
	Estimates of construction and production costs<br>
	Logistics costs.<br>
<br>
Business Feasibility Study for an Indonesia Company<br>
<br>
     The client wanted to assess the feasibility of utilizing a remote source of methane to produce urea and/or methanol. The study compared economics and scenarios for demand within the region and the world, and recommended a course of action.<br>
Plant Feasibility Study<br>
<br>
     For a North American chemical company, the consultants team conducted a feasibility study to construct an acetone cyanohydrin (ACH) plant near an existing methyl methacrylate (MMA) facility. We devel¬oped a plant profitability model using inputs that included a world ACH and MMA supply and de¬mand 5-year forecast, and a 15-year price forecast. Our findings indicated that the economics were marginal, and recommendations focused on optimal financing strategies. In addition, ACH and MMA sourcing and partnership options were discussed as alternatives to the originally intended project.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
Feasibility Study of a Petrochemical Complex in the Philippines<br>
<br>
     For the Philippine government, we assessed the feasibility of a petrochemical complex in the Philippines to select the optimum product mix, production scale, and the most suitable feedstock, as well as to estimate the expected profitability of a petrochemical complex. We determined poten¬tial domestic and export markets, product price levels, capital investment and operating costs, and the financial factors necessary in estimating the profitability of the entire complex and the individual products. The study involved contacting many governmental agencies and companies (including contractors, engi¬neering firms, petrochemical companies, plastic processors, and importers) that supplied informa¬tion about local costs, markets, and industrial conditions necessary to perform a realistic feasibility study.<br>
 <br>
Feasibility Study of the Petrochemical Industry in Nigeria<br>
<br>
     The consultants team assessed the economic and financial feasibility of Phase II of a national petroleum corpo¬ration&#39;s petrochemical programan integrated, olefins-based complex based on cracking natural gas liquids recovered from associated gas that was reinjected or flared. We developed independent assessments of Nigeria&#39;s economic outlook; the domestic and export demands for petrochemical products; raw material availability and price; polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) price trends; and the economics of producing olefins, PE, and PP in Nigeria. Individual cases were ana¬lyzed to assess how plant size, capital investment, product and feedstock prices, domestic demand, and export markets affect return on investment and net foreign exchange flow realized from the project.<br>
<br>
     In the study the following products were screened for the Phase II Program:  LDPE/LLDPE, isopropanol, HDPE, polyurethanes, polypropylene, SBR elastomers, PVC, benzene, polystyrene, toluene, polyethylene terephthlate, xylenes, vinyl acetate, and phthalic anhydride. Estimates of domestic demand, export potential, and minimum economic plant size were developed for each product. <br>
<br>
<br>
Petrochemical Pricing Model<br>
<br>
     We assisted Thailands developing petrochemical industry streamline transfer pricing in or¬der to develop a system that promoted optimal development of the industry as a whole. <br>
<br>
     We focused on developing a transfer pricing framework/model that:<br>
	Reflects longer term opportunity costs<br>
	Equitably allocates the tariff protection<br>
	Is transparent, flexible, and robust. <br>
<br>
     The model was constructed in the form of an easy-to-use Excel spreadsheet; we then pro¬vided instruction to Thai government organizations and companies involved in petrochemicals development and production on using the model effectively. <br>
<br>
     In addition to providing a rational framework for transfer prices, the model serves as a useful tool for strategic planning; for example, it makes it easy for industry participants to examine the profitability of both the industry as a whole and individual segments under various scenarios. Moreover, by clarifying considerations and constraints, it can facilitate efforts to optimize the development of the countrys industry over the longer term. <br>
<br>
<br>
Feasibility of Polyolefins Manufacture in Colombia<br>
<br>
     We evaluated the technoeconomic feasibility of polyolefin projects in Colombia to quantify in monetary terms the relative merits of options available to the country. We evaluated alterna¬tive manufacturing technologies, several production sites, and the overall level of investment. We assessed the impact of external forces, such as polyolefin prices and interest rates, on the fi¬nancial attractiveness of the ventures considered, as well as key elements that can affect the fi¬nancial performance of the projects, such as the availability of capital for project financing, inter¬est rates on debt, plant construction schedules, and market development targets. We also evalu¬ated and ranked the most suitable engineering contractors and technology licensers.<br>
<br>
Restructuring of Hong Kongs Plastics Conversion Industry <br>
<br>
     For Hong Kongs Industry Development Board, we recommended ways to help the industry advance technically and diversify into higher value-added products. We defined overseas prod¬ucts and market opportunities for Hong Kong manufacturers; assessed the general level of Hong Kong technology and compared it with the technology levels in the countries that are Hong Kongs primary customers; assessed factors affecting industry growth and development; and rec¬ommended actions to move the industry forward. <br>
<br>
A Master Plan Study of Petrochemicals in China<br>
<br>
     We helped SINOPEC International define and evaluate production options that would make efficient use of hydrocarbons from the Zhongyuan basin, as well as of the capital available for investment. We evaluated the feasibility of two basic production schemes:<br>
1.	A 100 kt/yr ethylene plant at Puyang using natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, and butane) available from associated gas producing LLDPE, polypropylene, MTBE, and maleic anhydride.<br>
2.	A 300 kt/yr ethylene plant adjacent to the Luoyang refinery using natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, butane, and C5+ condensate) available from associ¬ated gas processed at Puyang and transported by pipeline to the refinery, as well as liquefied petroleum gas and other streams available from the refinery. The operation of the refinery and ethylene plant would be highly integrated to maximize the use of various hydrocarbon streams from both operations. The product slate would be LLDPE, ethylene oxide, monoethylene glycol, styrene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, polyacrylonitrile fiber, butadiene, styrene butadi¬ene rubber, polystyrene, o-xylene, p-xylene, butene-1, phthalic anhydride, benzene, terephthalic acid, and polyester chips. <br>

Supply, Demand and Prices of Refinery Feedstocks and Products<br>
<br>
	Extensive data bases<br>
<br>
	Our extensive date bases help us provide data, analysis, and forecasts on issues of special relevance to petroleum companies.  ECT maintains a historical data base of crude oil, petroleum product, and petrochemical prices and related economic statistics that are key elements in our proprietary price forecasting methodologies.  <br>
	<br>
	ECT can provide a range of crude oil supply, demand, and price forecasts linked to selected economic scenarios, and petroleum product price forecasts for some base case (e.g. for Houston, Rotterdam, Singapore, etc.)  <br>
<br>
<br>
Supply, Demand, and Price Differentials for High-Quality Crude Oils.<br>
<br>
	To assist an oil company assess its competitive position relative to other producers, current ECT consultants estimated:<br>
<br>
- The demand for light, low-sulfur (LLS) crude oil in major markets, especially the United States, and the price premium--compared to lower quality oils--that LLS crude is likely to command in those markets<br>
<br>
- Potential supplies of LLS crude oil, by company and region.<br>
<br>
	We also identified and evaluated strategic options for improving the company&#39;s competitive position and profitability in upstream operations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Evaluation of Hydroisomerization Technology<br>
<br>
	To assist a South American oil company select a butadiene hydroisomerization process for one of its refineries, ECT consultants requested and evaluated process disclosures from 4 licensors. We evaluated the process economics, commercial experience, and contractual terms for each technology and recommended a licensor to the company.<br>
<br>
<br>

	Corporate.<br>
<br>
     The portfolio review provided a qualitative assessment of the companys business, and was primarily based on a review of historical strategic tactics; development of market attractiveness/business position matrices; and a general review of proprietary files and publicly available lit¬erature on the company.<br>
<br>
     The financial review tasks provided detailed quantitative estimates of product-by-product sales and operating profits, as well as product line estimates for cash flow, identifiable assets, net investment, and net income/net investment ratios for the company. Financial results for the chemicals operations were also placed in context with the performance for all company operations. Finally, the financial results of the companys and the clients chemical operations were compared.<br>
<br>
     These findings were then integrated into a qualitative assessment of the sources of competitive advantage for each product line. Generalizations about the sources of overall competitive advantage and about the companys strategy also resulted from comparing the individual product line strategies and results. The conclusions for each major product line were presented in a series of product profiles, which included brief reviews of product operations, integration, technology, and business positions, as well as discussions of the factors most important to the companys current success (position) in the product line and the outlook for the next 5 years.<br>

     We assisted Thailands developing petrochemical industry streamline transfer pricing in or¬der to develop a system that promoted optimal development of the industry as a whole. <br>
<br>
     We focused on developing a transfer pricing framework/model that:<br>
	Reflects longer term opportunity costs<br>
	Equitably allocates the tariff protection<br>
	Is transparent, flexible, and robust. <br>
<br>
     The model was constructed in the form of an easy-to-use Excel spreadsheet; we then pro¬vided instruction to Thai government organizations and companies involved in petrochemicals development and production on using the model effectively. <br>
<br>
     In addition to providing a rational framework for transfer prices, the model serves as a useful tool for strategic planning; for example, it makes it easy for industry participants to examine the profitability of both the industry as a whole and individual segments under various scenarios. Moreover, by clarifying considerations and constraints, it can facilitate efforts to optimize the development of the countrys industry over the longer term. <br>

Feasibility of Polyolefins Manufacture in Colombia<br>
<br>
     We evaluated the technoeconomic feasibility of polyolefin projects in Colombia to quantify in monetary terms the relative merits of options available to the country. We evaluated alterna¬tive manufacturing technologies, several production sites, and the overall level of investment. We assessed the impact of external forces, such as polyolefin prices and interest rates, on the fi¬nancial attractiveness of the ventures considered, as well as key elements that can affect the fi¬nancial performance of the projects, such as the availability of capital for project financing, inter¬est rates on debt, plant construction schedules, and market development targets. We also evalu¬ated and ranked the most suitable engineering contractors and technology licensers.<br>

Restructuring of Hong Kongs Plastics Conversion Industry <br>
<br>
     For Hong Kongs Industry Development Board, we recommended ways to help the industry advance technically and diversify into higher value-added products. We defined overseas prod¬ucts and market opportunities for Hong Kong manufacturers; assessed the general level of Hong Kong technology and compared it with the technology levels in the countries that are Hong Kongs primary customers; assessed factors affecting industry growth and development; and rec¬ommended actions to move the industry forward. <br>

A Master Plan Study of Petrochemicals in China<br>
<br>
     We helped SINOPEC International define and evaluate production options that would make efficient use of hydrocarbons from the Zhongyuan basin, as well as of the capital available for investment. We evaluated the feasibility of two basic production schemes:<br>
1.	A 100 kt/yr ethylene plant at Puyang using natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, and butane) available from associated gas producing LLDPE, polypropylene, MTBE, and maleic anhydride.<br>
2.	A 300 kt/yr ethylene plant adjacent to the Luoyang refinery using natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, butane, and C5+ condensate) available from associ¬ated gas processed at Puyang and transported by pipeline to the refinery, as well as liquefied petroleum gas and other streams available from the refinery. The operation of the refinery and ethylene plant would be highly integrated to maximize the use of various hydrocarbon streams from both operations. The product slate would be LLDPE, ethylene oxide, monoethylene glycol, styrene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, polyacrylonitrile fiber, butadiene, styrene butadi¬ene rubber, polystyrene, o-xylene, p-xylene, butene-1, phthalic anhydride, benzene, terephthalic acid, and polyester chips. <br>
