                            CaseBank specializes in harnessing the experience of your industry and your enterprise, and keeping it working for you.<br>
<br>
SpotLight®, our core product, delivers expert diagnostic guidance for solving equipment and process problems. It captures the experience of your global user community and delivers it as relevant, timely troubleshooting guidance where and when a problem occurs.<br>
<br>
When it comes to complex equipment and critical processes, the knowledge and expertise of an experienced work-force is our most valuable asset, so we guard the health and safety of our people accordingly. Yet we neglect to do the same for the enterprise by capturing and protecting its hard-earned experience. Retirements, illness, and the competitive environment steadily drain intellectual capital, leaving entire organizations vulnerable. To succeed in todays knowledge-based economy, there is no question that perishable experience must be preserved before it walks out the door.<br>
<br>
The intellectual capital of your organization in the area of diagnostic knowledge is the sum of the experience of your individual experts. SpotLight enables you to capture it all in one placeand to use it effectively.<br>
<br>
CaseBank provides the software tools, methodology and training to create successful SpotLight applications reliably and rapidly.<br>
Whether you need a turn-key web-based solution, a smart-phone and mobile capability, or a stand-alone Java-based application embedded in your product, Casebanks solutions provide real-time guidance and assistance for efficient and cost effective decision making.<br>

                            Each knowledge base or &quot;case-base&quot; is a specialized collection of Case Studies relevant to one particular knowledge domain--e.g. the CC130 aircraft, departmental operating procedures, in vivo drug interactions, etc... . Only real, documented events are developed into cases and published in the case-base.  Most case-bases developed by CaseBank to date have documented faults within a type of equipment and support fault diagnosis within maintenance, repair and overhaul operations.<br>
<br>
The case-base grows with use. The more it is used, the better it becomes and the more complete it&#39;s contents.  <br>
<br>
Field results show that traditional diagnostic systems have gaps in their problem solving abilities. SpotLight complements, and integrates with traditional fault isolation manuals and similar, traditional systems. <br>
<br>
SpotLight can serve organizations in two ways: as a powerful tool to minimize unplanned downtime on their own processes, systems, and equipment, and as a value-added sales and marketing tool that wins and keeps customers by delivering high quality support for the organization&#39;s products.   <br>
<br>
Currently specialized knowledge bases exist for Bombardier regional aircraft, Honeywell gas turbine engines and APU&#39;s, the CC-130 and CP-140 aircraft and the T-56 turbo-prop engine common to these two aircraft. Many other specialized knowledge bases are currently under development. CaseBank appreciates any opportunity to discuss your requirements<br>

                            SpotLight® delivers expert diagnostic guidance for solving equipment and process problems. It captures the global experience of your user community and delivers it as relevant, current troubleshooting guidance where and when a problem occurs.<br>
<br>
At the core of a SpotLight guided diagnostics and training solution is a technical knowledgebas (KB) containing all symptoms and solutions related to problems and failures within the subject equipment or process. While the value of a technical KB is intuitively well understood by many people, the establishment of a KB appears intimidating, risky, or downright impossible. In reality, it is a well-understood and manageable process. CaseBank has pioneered tools, techniques and methodologies for the creation and ongoing management of a technical knowledgebasecomprehensive tools and processes designed to establish and grow the initial KB as simply and consistently as possible.<br>
<br>
We can supply you with the same tools we ourselves use to create and maintain knowledgebases and train your staff in the same proven methodologies that work well for us. Furthmore, we can also provide any other level of follow-on support guidance or training you wish to ensure that your organization maximizes its return on the investment in SpotLight.<br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Airline Maintenance Technician<br>
We had one aircraft with a Steering Inop that had the aircraft down for 2 days and 48 man-hours were used in fixing it  SpotLight did not have a solution but the information was captured. The same problem occurred a month later, and the Denver Mechanic fixed it in 1 hour based on what he found in SpotLight. The power of communication!<br>
<br>
Airline Maintenance Technician<br>
As a result of situations like the following it has become a priority to have MX controllers trained on SpotLight.  Rather than send a speed switch and a mechanic to change it, they sent 2 mechanics and an Air Turbine starter on a road trip to an outstation. The following day they sent another ATS, plus a Start Valve, Start control PNL and a start control relay (close to $100,000 of parts). That did not fix the problem, so they then ferried the aircraft non revenue to a MX base for further troubleshooting. When I checked the plot notes for the out of service aircraft the problem was similar to a problem that I had experienced with another aircraft in phx and spotlight provided a solution that was a 100% fix the first time. I entered the symptoms into SpotLight and the solution that came back was the N1 monopole also called a speed switch. It was the first solution on the list.<br>
<br>
Airline Senior Maintenance Technician<br>
Spotlight has been a great tool.  I find the more I use and learn about it, the better my payback is. Following are three stories. Two show what happens when SpotLight is used, the third, sadly, shows what can happen when it is not.<br>
<br>
Crew reported an overspeed warning horn sounding when it should not. Prior to entering Spotlight I considered replacing the obvious components... ADU, IOP, IOM, etc. Considered pitot static testing, etc. The cost of installing these components 1 at a time is horrible, and I still would have been wrong.  Besides being wrong, the function test time would have been an entire day or more,  plus there would have been a requirement to move people, equipment and parts to an outstation. We are fortunate that we normally stock these items, so delivery times are not involved. I entered the symptoms into SpotLight and Spotlight popped up with a 100% match for my entry.  WOW#1 sensor bad. I asked outstation mtx to read me PSEU faults.   WOW #1 nose sensor was faulted, and then replaced. The upshot is for 10% of the cost, the aircraft was returned to service in a matter of 2 or 3 hrs.  Without Spotlight assistance, I would have never dreamed to check PSEU, and the aircraft would have been out of service for days (if I ever did fix it on my own). <br>
<br>
Powerplant message was posted without supporting fault codes.  Had no idea where to go with this: ADU,  EMU, FADEC, PEC, IOM, IOP, DU&#39;s - who knows?  Spotlight knows.  This could well have been over $250,000 in parts.  SpotLight&#39;s solution, the PEC,  was expensive, but correct.<br>
<br>
Did not seem like a huge problem, but it got expensive anyway. The main battery did not show load on a particular a/c... It was such an obvious problem we didnt think to check SpotLight. The problem nagged on for days with delays and cancellations.  Crew would report the problem and a part would get changed.  This repeated 8 times, then we replaced the Shunt. That fixed the problem. Total cost over the 8 days was estimated to be over $75,000. Just for fun, I decided to check SpotLight after the fact. SpotLight had the correct solution right away. We later had the same problem on 4 other a/c.  Blushingly, I had the shunt sense lines re-terminated and the shunt contact areas thoroughly cleaned.  No repeat problems with these a/c either. This red-face problem looked like it would grow into a fleet issue, so I had all the main battery shunts cleaned and sense lines checked for corrosion. No problem in the fleet since. <br>

           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Michael Fox, Director of Maintenance, Horizon Air<br>
&quot;The benefits of SpotLight are real and potentially very significant. A CRJ700 showed a fault in the nosewheel steering. We changed a fairly expensive part suggested by the troubleshooting manual, but the fault persisted. We changed several more parts without success and the aircraft remained out of service. We decided to see if SpotLight would help. Within seconds, SpotLight came up with a similar problem and pointed to a situation that had been experienced and solved previously. Once we recognized the solution, we realized with some frustration that we had resolved the same fault on another aircraft only a few months earlier.&quot;  <br>
<br>
<br>
Tom Nelson, Maintenance Lead, Pinnacle Airlines<br>
&quot;I use SpotLight a lot. Sometimes I use it for help, but even when I think I know what the fix is, I will run SpotLight to confirm my thinking. It&#39;s nice to know that someone else has encountered the same problem and that my fix is likely the correct one.&quot;<br>

                            CaseBank specializes in harnessing the experience of your industry and your enterprise, and keeping it working for you.<br>
<br>
SpotLight®, our core product, delivers expert diagnostic guidance for solving equipment and process problems. It captures the experience of your global user community and delivers it as relevant, timely troubleshooting guidance where and when a problem occurs.<br>
<br>
When it comes to complex equipment and critical processes, the knowledge and expertise of an experienced work-force is our most valuable asset, so we guard the health and safety of our people accordingly. Yet we neglect to do the same for the enterprise by capturing and protecting its hard-earned experience. Retirements, illness, and the competitive environment steadily drain intellectual capital, leaving entire organizations vulnerable. To succeed in todays knowledge-based economy, there is no question that perishable experience must be preserved before it walks out the door.<br>
<br>
The intellectual capital of your organization in the area of diagnostic knowledge is the sum of the experience of your individual experts. SpotLight enables you to capture it all in one placeand to use it effectively.<br>
<br>
CaseBank provides the software tools, methodology and training to create successful SpotLight applications reliably and rapidly.<br>
Whether you need a turn-key web-based solution, a smart-phone and mobile capability, or a stand-alone Java-based application embedded in your product, Casebanks solutions provide real-time guidance and assistance for efficient and cost effective decision making.<br>

                            Each knowledge base or &quot;case-base&quot; is a specialized collection of Case Studies relevant to one particular knowledge domain--e.g. the CC130 aircraft, departmental operating procedures, in vivo drug interactions, etc... . Only real, documented events are developed into cases and published in the case-base.  Most case-bases developed by CaseBank to date have documented faults within a type of equipment and support fault diagnosis within maintenance, repair and overhaul operations.<br>
<br>
The case-base grows with use. The more it is used, the better it becomes and the more complete it&#39;s contents.  <br>
<br>
Field results show that traditional diagnostic systems have gaps in their problem solving abilities. SpotLight complements, and integrates with traditional fault isolation manuals and similar, traditional systems. <br>
<br>
SpotLight can serve organizations in two ways: as a powerful tool to minimize unplanned downtime on their own processes, systems, and equipment, and as a value-added sales and marketing tool that wins and keeps customers by delivering high quality support for the organization&#39;s products.   <br>
<br>
Currently specialized knowledge bases exist for Bombardier regional aircraft, Honeywell gas turbine engines and APU&#39;s, the CC-130 and CP-140 aircraft and the T-56 turbo-prop engine common to these two aircraft. Many other specialized knowledge bases are currently under development. CaseBank appreciates any opportunity to discuss your requirements<br>

                            SpotLight® delivers expert diagnostic guidance for solving equipment and process problems. It captures the global experience of your user community and delivers it as relevant, current troubleshooting guidance where and when a problem occurs.<br>
<br>
At the core of a SpotLight guided diagnostics and training solution is a technical knowledgebas (KB) containing all symptoms and solutions related to problems and failures within the subject equipment or process. While the value of a technical KB is intuitively well understood by many people, the establishment of a KB appears intimidating, risky, or downright impossible. In reality, it is a well-understood and manageable process. CaseBank has pioneered tools, techniques and methodologies for the creation and ongoing management of a technical knowledgebasecomprehensive tools and processes designed to establish and grow the initial KB as simply and consistently as possible.<br>
<br>
We can supply you with the same tools we ourselves use to create and maintain knowledgebases and train your staff in the same proven methodologies that work well for us. Furthmore, we can also provide any other level of follow-on support guidance or training you wish to ensure that your organization maximizes its return on the investment in SpotLight.<br>

              Airline Maintenance Technician<br>
We had one aircraft with a Steering Inop that had the aircraft down for 2 days and 48 man-hours were used in fixing it  SpotLight did not have a solution but the information was captured. The same problem occurred a month later, and the Denver Mechanic fixed it in 1 hour based on what he found in SpotLight. The power of communication!<br>

As a result of situations like the following it has become a priority to have MX controllers trained on SpotLight.  Rather than send a speed switch and a mechanic to change it, they sent 2 mechanics and an Air Turbine starter on a road trip to an outstation. The following day they sent another ATS, plus a Start Valve, Start control PNL and a start control relay (close to $100,000 of parts). That did not fix the problem, so they then ferried the aircraft non revenue to a MX base for further troubleshooting. When I checked the plot notes for the out of service aircraft the problem was similar to a problem that I had experienced with another aircraft in phx and spotlight provided a solution that was a 100% fix the first time. I entered the symptoms into SpotLight and the solution that came back was the N1 monopole also called a speed switch. It was the first solution on the list.<br>

Spotlight has been a great tool.  I find the more I use and learn about it, the better my payback is. Following are three stories. Two show what happens when SpotLight is used, the third, sadly, shows what can happen when it is not.<br>
<br>
Crew reported an overspeed warning horn sounding when it should not. Prior to entering Spotlight I considered replacing the obvious components... ADU, IOP, IOM, etc. Considered pitot static testing, etc. The cost of installing these components 1 at a time is horrible, and I still would have been wrong.  Besides being wrong, the function test time would have been an entire day or more,  plus there would have been a requirement to move people, equipment and parts to an outstation. We are fortunate that we normally stock these items, so delivery times are not involved. I entered the symptoms into SpotLight and Spotlight popped up with a 100% match for my entry.  WOW#1 sensor bad. I asked outstation mtx to read me PSEU faults.   WOW #1 nose sensor was faulted, and then replaced. The upshot is for 10% of the cost, the aircraft was returned to service in a matter of 2 or 3 hrs.  Without Spotlight assistance, I would have never dreamed to check PSEU, and the aircraft would have been out of service for days (if I ever did fix it on my own). <br>
<br>
Powerplant message was posted without supporting fault codes.  Had no idea where to go with this: ADU,  EMU, FADEC, PEC, IOM, IOP, DU&#39;s - who knows?  Spotlight knows.  This could well have been over $250,000 in parts.  SpotLight&#39;s solution, the PEC,  was expensive, but correct.<br>
<br>
Did not seem like a huge problem, but it got expensive anyway. The main battery did not show load on a particular a/c... It was such an obvious problem we didnt think to check SpotLight. The problem nagged on for days with delays and cancellations.  Crew would report the problem and a part would get changed.  This repeated 8 times, then we replaced the Shunt. That fixed the problem. Total cost over the 8 days was estimated to be over $75,000. Just for fun, I decided to check SpotLight after the fact. SpotLight had the correct solution right away. We later had the same problem on 4 other a/c.  Blushingly, I had the shunt sense lines re-terminated and the shunt contact areas thoroughly cleaned.  No repeat problems with these a/c either. This red-face problem looked like it would grow into a fleet issue, so I had all the main battery shunts cleaned and sense lines checked for corrosion. No problem in the fleet since. <br>

              Michael Fox, Director of Maintenance, Horizon Air<br>
&quot;The benefits of SpotLight are real and potentially very significant. A CRJ700 showed a fault in the nosewheel steering. We changed a fairly expensive part suggested by the troubleshooting manual, but the fault persisted. We changed several more parts without success and the aircraft remained out of service. We decided to see if SpotLight would help. Within seconds, SpotLight came up with a similar problem and pointed to a situation that had been experienced and solved previously. Once we recognized the solution, we realized with some frustration that we had resolved the same fault on another aircraft only a few months earlier.&quot;  <br>

&quot;I use SpotLight a lot. Sometimes I use it for help, but even when I think I know what the fix is, I will run SpotLight to confirm my thinking. It&#39;s nice to know that someone else has encountered the same problem and that my fix is likely the correct one.&quot;<br>
