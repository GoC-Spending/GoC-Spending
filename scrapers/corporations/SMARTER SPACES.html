About BOMA<br>
In 1915, BOMA International published the first Standard Method of Floor Measurement for Office Buildings. It has been accepted and approved by the American National Standards Institute. Throughout the years, the standard has been revised to reflect the changing needs of the real estate market and the evolution of office building design.<br>
<br>
This latest version, Office Buildings: Standard Methods of Measurement (ANSI/BOMA Z65.1 – 2010), provides a uniform basis for measuring rentable area in both existing and new office buildings by taking a building-wide approach to floor area measurement. It provides a methodology for measuring both occupant space as well as the space that benefits all occupants.<br>

We manage and execute corporate moves<br>
We make moves seamless and straight forward<br>
Keep your staff focused on core roles and work responsibilities<br>
Save money, time and eliminate stress…<br>
<br>
What we do<br>
A common mistake many companies make is in the belief that by managing their relocation themselves they will save money; the general thought being how hard can it be to get the business from point A to point B? Companies proceed to assign an internal resource who doesn’t have the expertise, focus, or time; the resource is able to get them to point B. They have arrived at their new location with a dysfunctional business, unhappy staff created by the confusion and chaos, and it has cost them double what it should have in additional cost, overruns of an unrealistic budget, and loss of productivity. This can be avoided by hiring a professional with the knowledge and expertise to create a strategic plan to execute a cost effective and well organized relocation.<br>
<br>
Keeping relocation’s on-time and on-plan<br>
Smarter Spaces has extensive experience in relocating office infrastructure and company assets. We work directly with our clients to develop a plan for the relocation of staff, office furniture, phones, computers, servers, network and telecommunications equipment and services.<br>
<br>
Our approach to office relocation’s<br>
Whether you’re opening a new office, relocating an existing one, or managing day-to-day moves in your current office, we can provide you with the right resources and expertise for your needs. We work with you to develop a schedule, budget, and strategic plans of action so that you have a clear understanding of all the requirements to move your business, business divisions, and/or departments. We get the job done right the first time – minimizing rework and reducing costs.<br>
<br>
How does it work?<br>
Smarter Spaces develops everything from budgetary numbers to critical vendor requirements, RFP development and analysis, to vendor selection and on-site implementation and management vital to a successful relocation plan, or move-in to a new office space. We offer turnkey facility solutions from initial design to occupancy of the facility by ensuring everything is completed as planned and on time.  During execution we are the first ones onsite and the last to leave!<br>
<br>
We coordinate many aspects of a move, including:<br>
Planning and scheduling of the move – We are the first ones on site and the last to leave.<br>
Employee coordination, communications, and liaison. We recognize relocation can be a very emotional process.<br>

About BOMA<br>
In 1915, BOMA International published the first Standard Method of Floor Measurement for Office Buildings. It has been accepted and approved by the American National Standards Institute. Throughout the years, the standard has been revised to reflect the changing needs of the real estate market and the evolution of office building design.<br>
<br>
This latest version, Office Buildings: Standard Methods of Measurement (ANSI/BOMA Z65.1 – 2010), provides a uniform basis for measuring rentable area in both existing and new office buildings by taking a building-wide approach to floor area measurement. It provides a methodology for measuring both occupant space as well as the space that benefits all occupants.<br>

                            Evacuation mapping solutions that meet your local and national building codes and regulations Make your company stand out by demonstrating you care about your occupants’ safety. The analysis of escape routes and pedestrian movement are fundamental elements within an overall fire safety strategy. They are also required by law in most jurisdictions. Smarter Spaces can help you develop effective and economical evacuation maps for all of your facilities.<br>
<br>
What are evacuation maps?<br>
Our illustrations inform and guide both staff and the public out of a facility safely in the event of an emergency. These evacuation maps outline building emergency procedures, locations of critical emergency equipment and help users identify where their point of origin is and where to find an appropriate exit.<br>
<br>

<br>
We can also produce facility illustrations for placement adjacent to facility fire panels for first responders.<br>
<br>
Framing and mounting<br>
We offer a variety of economical priced and modern casement solutions to choose from to meet your budget. Including- Laminated, Ultraboard, AluPanel, Plaque Mount, and Snap Frames. Various sizes and colors available.<br>
<br>
Local &amp; national regulatory compliance<br>
Prior to submitting the final product to our clients in part with our quality assurance guarantee and due-diligence, we will provide electronic copies to the local industry authorities (Fire Inspector, Fire Marshall Office) to validate our maps are in compliance with local and national codes and regulations. This provides a level of added value to our clients.<br>
<br>

Save money, time and eliminate stress…<br>
<br>
What we do<br>
A common mistake many companies make is in the belief that by managing their relocation themselves they will save money; the general thought being how hard can it be to get the business from point A to point B? Companies proceed to assign an internal resource who doesn’t have the expertise, focus, or time; the resource is able to get them to point B. They have arrived at their new location with a dysfunctional business, unhappy staff created by the confusion and chaos, and it has cost them double what it should have in additional cost, overruns of an unrealistic budget, and loss of productivity. This can be avoided by hiring a professional with the knowledge and expertise to create a strategic plan to execute a cost effective and well organized relocation.<br>
<br>
Keeping relocation’s on-time and on-plan<br>
Smarter Spaces has extensive experience in relocating office infrastructure and company assets. We work directly with our clients to develop a plan for the relocation of staff, office furniture, phones, computers, servers, network and telecommunications equipment and services.<br>
<br>
Our approach to office relocation’s<br>
Whether you’re opening a new office, relocating an existing one, or managing day-to-day moves in your current office, we can provide you with the right resources and expertise for your needs. We work with you to develop a schedule, budget, and strategic plans of action so that you have a clear understanding of all the requirements to move your business, business divisions, and/or departments. We get the job done right the first time – minimizing rework and reducing costs.<br>
<br>
How does it work?<br>
Smarter Spaces develops everything from budgetary numbers to critical vendor requirements, RFP development and analysis, to vendor selection and on-site implementation and management vital to a successful relocation plan, or move-in to a new office space. We offer turnkey facility solutions from initial design to occupancy of the facility by ensuring everything is completed as planned and on time.  During execution we are the first ones onsite and the last to leave!<br>
<br>
We coordinate many aspects of a move, including:<br>
Planning and scheduling of the move – We are the first ones on site and the last to leave.<br>
Employee coordination, communications, and liaison. We recognize relocation can be a very emotional process.<br>
Furnishings: Workstations, cubicles, desks, executive office furniture office suites, filing, and storage; we have done it all and know how to inventory it, tag it and relocate it.<br>
Electrical: Workstations, cubicles, office suites and copy centers and additional offices<br>
Structured Wiring &amp; Communications: Voice, Data, VOIP Equipment: computers, printers, faxes, servers etc.<br>
Clean Up: We manage the commercial moving and cleaning – these are important details that help minimize launch day challenges.<br>
