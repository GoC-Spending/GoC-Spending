        <br>            Who We Are: Established in 1975, Diamond Schmitt Architects has grown steadily with a focus on buildings for cultural, civic, health care and academic institutions. The firm comprises 141 architectural staff and 34 support staff, including 18 principals, 4 senior associates, and 15 associates. The firm has received national and international recognition for the planning and design of buildings that achieve design excellence, display a deep understanding of the context in which they are located and are innovative in the way in which user satisfaction is provided. <br><br>Mission: The firm seeks to achieve a high standard of excellence. We take pride in designing buildings which support both the ideals and the functional requirements of its users. Popular success has been achieved by unremitting attention to user needs and aspirations. Critical recognition has been achieved through commitment to design from first principles. <br><br>Design Excellence: Diamond Schmitt have received over 280 regional, national and international awards for design, including six Governor General’s Awards for architecture. Working with colleges and universities, academic institutions, government and private clients, the firm has designed public places and master plans, spaces for exhibition, medical and research facilities, performing arts centers, academic buildings, mixed-use and commercial projects. In 2004, and from 2008 to 2014, the firm was named one of Canada’s 50 Best Managed Companies - the only  architecture firm awarded this distinction.<br><br>In 2004, 2007, 2008 and 2009 BUSINESS WEEK / ARCHITECTURAL RECORD selected the Israeli Foreign Ministry; the Four Seasons Opera House; the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington D.C., and Southbrook Vineyards respectively, as the Worlds 10 Best Buildings completed in those years. <br><br>Sustainable Design: Diamond Schmitt Architects is committed to producing sustainable building and site design to preserve and enrich our environment. The firm is a member of both the U.S. Green Building Council and the Canada Green Building Council. The firm has 32 LEED (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Efficient) accredited sustainable design architects. More than 35 projects are registered for LEED designation with 3 achieving LEED Platinum Certification, 20 LEED Gold, 3 LEED Silver, and 1 N.C. The firm is a proven leader in sustainable design and pioneered the application of a living wall bio-filter to purify air quality. <br><br>Project Management: The early planning stages of a project are particularly critical to the outcome, and we have developed an approach that ensures we have all the important information at hand and all the crucial systems in place before design development gets underway. Once preparations are complete, we take great care to maintain strict control over the design, documentation and construction processes, especially with respect to schedule, costs, and quality.<br>

            Diamond Schmitt utilizes industry standard versions of AutoCAD, Revit Architecture, Autodesk 3Ds Max, Google Sketchup and Rhino. Due to the complexity of the work that we undertake, Diamond Schmitt has been able to customize many of these industry wide programs to suit our own requirements and improve our ability to respond to the unique needs of each client. <br>
<br>
The firm has invested in customized Building Information Modeling solutions to provide clients with the benefit of three dimensional problem solving and documentation. We develop the design and documentation for our projects in Revit. Building information models allows the team to work on a shared model that allows for constant review, checking and sharing of project information. As a result, projects have benefited enormously from the ability to coordinate structural and MEP components during the design phase. We link all project related documents (room data sheets, outline specifications, meeting minutes) to the model so that the team has current information available to them at all times. To support our teams in REVIT we have developed our own detailed execution plans to make sure there is a seamless interaction between the client, all team members and ourselves.

So this is what superlative looks like up close. This building is the essence of superlative  it is the largest building to have ever been built on this campus; it is the most technically advanced; it is the most magnificent. But most of all it is the greatest example of the realized potential of universities, government and private donors working together to achieve that which none of us could have accomplished alone.<br>

SELECT INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS:<br>
Project:  Mariinsky Theatre II<br>
Country: St. Petersburg, Russia<br>
Contribution:<br>
Diamond Schmitt Architects completed a program study, master-plan , design, and construction for the new Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The 2,000 seat auditorium is the new home for the Mariinsky Ballet and Opera Company (former know during the Soviet era as the Kirov Ballet and Opera Company), and is located adjacent to the historic Mariinsky Theatre built in 1853, in the heritage district of central Saint Petersburg. The theatre was completed in 2013. <br>
<br>
The new theatre building is 76,600 square metres in size and includes new facilities to completely modernize both the back-of-house and front-of-house operations.  In addition to the main stage the production facility will include three practice stages, a rehearsal auditorium, and set construction facilities that are connected to the original Mariinsky Theatre by a bridge over the Kryukov Canal.  The auditorium is designed with superior natural acoustics to showcase the artistic excellence of the Mariinsky musicians and performers; and the lobby spaces overlooking Decembrist Boulevard present a contemporary face for this historically renowned company.<br>
<br>
The 2,500 person Mariinsky Theatre Company includes symphony, opera and ballet organizations under the artistic direction of Maestro Valery Gergiev.  The Mariinsky Theatre is considered the birthplace of ballet, and the company continues to travel and perform in all corners of the international stage.  The new theatre provides an expanded home to match the reputation of this dynamic performing arts company.<br>
<br>
Project:  Israeli Foreign Ministry<br>
Country: Israel<br>
Contribution:<br>
The plan is designed to meet the particular requirements of the Foreign Ministry of Israel. The 40,000 square meter building is also intended to be a prototype of secure office design in a Middle Eastern context.  <br>
<br>
The foundation of the design is efficient and flexible office space. Configuration, column and window spacing, raised accessible floors and core design have all been planned to meet the highest standards of office accommodation, and to accept the widest range of office layouts. This has been achieved while satisfying structural economies and providing universal heating, ventilating, air conditioning, power and telecommunications distribution. Security measures have been incorporated throughout, including an innovative blast resistant wall assembly for the main reception space.<br>
<br>
Project:  Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts         <br>
Country: Toronto, Canada<br>
Contribution:<br>
The new Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts is situated on a tight site in downtown Toronto. Flanked by tall high rise buildings and sitting on top of the citys subway system, the new opera house, in a mere 5 months since its inaugural performance, has become an urban landmark in the city. <br>
<br>
The transparency of the façade of the Centre is paramount to the success of the architectural concept for the building. The objective was to produce a façade that was incredibly transparent and yet provided comfort from the heat and glare of the western sun. This University Avenue façade, nearly twenty metres high and fifty metres long, contains the City Room, multiple levels of lobby and stair as well as a 200-seat amphitheatre. <br>
<br>
A grand glass staircase, with a horizontal run of almost 27 meters and a rise of 8.8 metres, connects the upper levels of the lobby with the city room. The edifice is the longest spanning glass stair constructed in the world.<br>
<br>
The intimate 2,000 seat, 5 ring auditorium is modeled on the traditional European horseshoe configuration. Built to the extremely demanding N-1 criteria for acoustic quality, the Four Seasons Centre is the first structurally isolated performance facility in Canada.<br>
<br>
Project:  Montreal Symphony Orchestra Hall<br>
Country: Montreal, Canada<br>
Following an international competition the acclaimed Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO) and officials from the City of Montreal selected Diamond Schmitt Architects to lead the design of the new MSO concert hall, L’Adresse Symphonique. For this project, Diamond Schmitt Architects teamed up with Montreal construction group SNC-Lavalin Incorporated and local architects Aedifica. <br>
<br>
In line with the mission of the Montreal Symphony, the new concert hall is designed with the overriding principles of creating an exceptional auditory and visual experience for patrons, as well as creating an open and engaging space within the city. It is a democratic and welcoming hall, utilizing design excellence and innovation to compliment the orchestra’s goal of attracting the broadest possible audience. <br>
<br>
All aspects of the hall’s design are measured by their service to the goal of creating an intimate but shared experience of performance, and an enhancement of the public life of the city. The building strikes a balance between design that is in and of itself beautiful, and open in its definition and style. The va et viens of patrons to the venue, the processions to and from one’s seats, the animated talk during intermission, in short the societal dance that surrounds a performance, are clearly visible to passersby. By revealing the procession and activity associated with attending a performance, a new audience is cultivated and a new relationship formed between the patron and the city. <br>
<br>
Project:  Health and Sciences Building,  Santa Fe Community College (LEED Gold Certified)<br>
Country: Santa Fe, New Mexico, U.S.A.<br>
Contribution:<br>
Santa Fe Community College welcomes the new LEED Gold certified Health and Sciences Building designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects and Studio Southwest Architects. The 48,000 square foot facility is the centerpiece of the college&#39;s School of Health and Sciences, which offers programs in nursing, respiratory therapy, dental health, medical assisting, emergency medical training and biology. Designed with sustainability in mind, this state-of-the-art facility achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification.<br>
<br>
The Health and Sciences Building replaces several temporary portable buildings on the north side of the Santa Fe Community College campus. It includes laboratories, classrooms and offices dedicated to training students for careers in health and sciences professions. The building also houses a dental clinic operated by Santa Fes La Familia Medical Center, a 20-chair clinic which provides dental health services to families and individuals in need, while also serving as a clinical training site for SFCC dental technician students.<br>
<br>
The building expands laboratory space for SFCC&#39;s health and sciences programs by offering three new nursing labs, two biology labs, one dental lab and two static labs for Emergency Medical Service Institute training. The building will also feature simulations labs, complete with human patient simulators and a central observation room. The building is arranged around two courtyards of differing character which provide outdoor spaces for students to gather, study, eat or take a break between classes.<br>
<br>
Project:  Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute (LEED Gold Registered)<br>
Country: Toronto, Canada<br>
Contribution:<br>
The St. Michael’s Hospital Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute brings together leading edge research and medical education programs within a single facility, seeking to accelerate the translation of research-based discoveries to front-line healthcare applications. Named after two significant foundations, the Institute comprises two buildings, programmatically distinct, yet physically integrated by a tunnelled bridge: the Keenan Research Centre and the Li Ka Shing International Centre for Health Care Education. <br>
<br>
The Keenan Centre houses state-of-the-art wet bench laboratories with an emphasis towards cancer, kidney disease, vascular biology and trauma research, dry research facilities to support community-based healthcare research, and a leading edge animal care facility. The Li Ka Shing International Centre for Healthcare Education will enhance existing education programs in medicine, nursing and allied health in addition to providing new administrative offices for existing programs in the Education Centre. <br>
<br>
Project:  Papadakis Integrated Science Building,  Drexel University (LEED Gold Certified)<br>
Country: Philadelphia, USA<br>
Contribution:<br>
The new Papdakis Integrated Sciences Building is home to the Biosciences Department. Organized around a five storey atrium the building contains 32 state-of-the-art research labs, 8 teaching labs as well as specialized computer and paleontology laboratories. In addition to the laboratory wings, there are 40 faculty offices looking southwest on Woodlawn Walk. At the ground floor 7 classrooms and a 200 seat auditorium, provide for teaching spaces for the Biology Department and the wider University community. <br>
<br>
The atrium is activated by a four storey spiral staircase that provides open, transparent and convenient connection between disciplines, faculty and students. Balconies and lounges at each level provide opportunities for collegial collaboration and social interaction. A 22 foot wide, 80 foot high living biowall with 1500 plants is integrated into the building’s air handling system achieving an 80% air quality improvement and 30% reduction in energy consumption. Diamond Schmitt also designed the building as an integrated component of the teaching program, with Faculty and staff using air ports inserted in the wall to sample and analyze the air quality.<br>
<br>
Student and faculty lounges on every floor, dubbed collaboratories by faculty provide opportunities for meetings and small gatherings and are contained in a projecting glass volume on Chestnut Avenue. The Integrated Sciences Building possesses a high degree of internal transparency harvests natural light to the labs with expansive windows and the skylit atrium. The building, clad in Indiana limestone, and the elliptical glass volume of the lounges marking the principal entry, establish the new presence for Drexel in the academic core of Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
Project:   Computer Science and Engineering Building, <br>
              University of Michigan<br>
Country:  Detroit, Michigan<br>
Contribution:<br>
The Computer Science and Engineering building accommodates faculty offices, research labs, and teaching spaces on the North Campus of the University of Michigan.  <br>
<br>
The 102,000 square foot structure will meet the needs of approximately 900 undergraduates, 300 graduate students, and 51 faculty members currently spread throughout multiple facilities. It includes computing labs, classrooms (60 seat and 120 seat), conference rooms, and student project space all in a wireless environment. All Computer Science and Engineering faculty and staff, student offices and labs will be housed in the new building. <br>
<br>
High indoor environmental quality is a key feature of the building.  Each office is placed on the perimeter of the building, naturally lit, and has an operable window.  Daylight is into the building by using transom windows in corridors, and through the extensive placement of skylights that cover a four-storey atrium space and a long linear stair. One of the primary goals of the project was to bring together all CSE faculty into one building to foster interaction in a stimulating environment. The visibility afforded by the generous central atrium space, around which all labs and offices are organized, will provide a great sense of community among the CSE faculty, students and staff and encourage positive interaction within and among research groups.<br>

            Diamond Schmitt utilizes industry standard versions of AutoCAD, Revit Architecture, Autodesk 3Ds Max, Google Sketchup and Rhino. Due to the complexity of the work that we undertake, Diamond Schmitt has been able to customize many of these industry wide programs to suit our own requirements and improve our ability to respond to the unique needs of each client. <br>
<br>
The firm has invested in customized Building Information Modeling solutions to provide clients with the benefit of three dimensional problem solving and documentation. We develop the design and documentation for our projects in Revit. Building information models allows the team to work on a shared model that allows for constant review, checking and sharing of project information. As a result, projects have benefited enormously from the ability to coordinate structural and MEP components during the design phase. We link all project related documents (room data sheets, outline specifications, meeting minutes) to the model so that the team has current information available to them at all times. To support our teams in REVIT we have developed our own detailed execution plans to make sure there is a seamless interaction between the client, all team members and ourselves.

So this is what superlative looks like up close. This building is the essence of superlative  it is the largest building to have ever been built on this campus; it is the most technically advanced; it is the most magnificent. But most of all it is the greatest example of the realized potential of universities, government and private donors working together to achieve that which none of us could have accomplished alone.<br>

Project:  Mariinsky Theatre II<br>
Country: St. Petersburg, Russia<br>
Contribution:<br>
Diamond Schmitt Architects completed a program study, master-plan , design, and construction for the new Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The 2,000 seat auditorium is the new home for the Mariinsky Ballet and Opera Company (former know during the Soviet era as the Kirov Ballet and Opera Company), and is located adjacent to the historic Mariinsky Theatre built in 1853, in the heritage district of central Saint Petersburg. The theatre was completed in 2013. <br>
<br>
The new theatre building is 76,600 square metres in size and includes new facilities to completely modernize both the back-of-house and front-of-house operations.  In addition to the main stage the production facility will include three practice stages, a rehearsal auditorium, and set construction facilities that are connected to the original Mariinsky Theatre by a bridge over the Kryukov Canal.  The auditorium is designed with superior natural acoustics to showcase the artistic excellence of the Mariinsky musicians and performers; and the lobby spaces overlooking Decembrist Boulevard present a contemporary face for this historically renowned company.<br>
<br>
The 2,500 person Mariinsky Theatre Company includes symphony, opera and ballet organizations under the artistic direction of Maestro Valery Gergiev.  The Mariinsky Theatre is considered the birthplace of ballet, and the company continues to travel and perform in all corners of the international stage.  The new theatre provides an expanded home to match the reputation of this dynamic performing arts company.<br>
<br>
Project:  Israeli Foreign Ministry<br>
Country: Israel<br>
Contribution:<br>
The plan is designed to meet the particular requirements of the Foreign Ministry of Israel. The 40,000 square meter building is also intended to be a prototype of secure office design in a Middle Eastern context.  <br>
<br>
The foundation of the design is efficient and flexible office space. Configuration, column and window spacing, raised accessible floors and core design have all been planned to meet the highest standards of office accommodation, and to accept the widest range of office layouts. This has been achieved while satisfying structural economies and providing universal heating, ventilating, air conditioning, power and telecommunications distribution. Security measures have been incorporated throughout, including an innovative blast resistant wall assembly for the main reception space.<br>
<br>
Project:  Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts         <br>
Country: Toronto, Canada<br>
Contribution:<br>
The new Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts is situated on a tight site in downtown Toronto. Flanked by tall high rise buildings and sitting on top of the citys subway system, the new opera house, in a mere 5 months since its inaugural performance, has become an urban landmark in the city. <br>
<br>
The transparency of the façade of the Centre is paramount to the success of the architectural concept for the building. The objective was to produce a façade that was incredibly transparent and yet provided comfort from the heat and glare of the western sun. This University Avenue façade, nearly twenty metres high and fifty metres long, contains the City Room, multiple levels of lobby and stair as well as a 200-seat amphitheatre. <br>
<br>
A grand glass staircase, with a horizontal run of almost 27 meters and a rise of 8.8 metres, connects the upper levels of the lobby with the city room. The edifice is the longest spanning glass stair constructed in the world.<br>
<br>
The intimate 2,000 seat, 5 ring auditorium is modeled on the traditional European horseshoe configuration. Built to the extremely demanding N-1 criteria for acoustic quality, the Four Seasons Centre is the first structurally isolated performance facility in Canada.<br>
<br>
Project:  Montreal Symphony Orchestra Hall<br>
Country: Montreal, Canada<br>
Following an international competition the acclaimed Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO) and officials from the City of Montreal selected Diamond Schmitt Architects to lead the design of the new MSO concert hall, L’Adresse Symphonique. For this project, Diamond Schmitt Architects teamed up with Montreal construction group SNC-Lavalin Incorporated and local architects Aedifica. <br>
<br>
In line with the mission of the Montreal Symphony, the new concert hall is designed with the overriding principles of creating an exceptional auditory and visual experience for patrons, as well as creating an open and engaging space within the city. It is a democratic and welcoming hall, utilizing design excellence and innovation to compliment the orchestra’s goal of attracting the broadest possible audience. <br>
<br>
All aspects of the hall’s design are measured by their service to the goal of creating an intimate but shared experience of performance, and an enhancement of the public life of the city. The building strikes a balance between design that is in and of itself beautiful, and open in its definition and style. The va et viens of patrons to the venue, the processions to and from one’s seats, the animated talk during intermission, in short the societal dance that surrounds a performance, are clearly visible to passersby. By revealing the procession and activity associated with attending a performance, a new audience is cultivated and a new relationship formed between the patron and the city. <br>
<br>
Project:  Health and Sciences Building,  Santa Fe Community College (LEED Gold Certified)<br>
Country: Santa Fe, New Mexico, U.S.A.<br>
Contribution:<br>
Santa Fe Community College welcomes the new LEED Gold certified Health and Sciences Building designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects and Studio Southwest Architects. The 48,000 square foot facility is the centerpiece of the college&#39;s School of Health and Sciences, which offers programs in nursing, respiratory therapy, dental health, medical assisting, emergency medical training and biology. Designed with sustainability in mind, this state-of-the-art facility achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification.<br>
<br>
The Health and Sciences Building replaces several temporary portable buildings on the north side of the Santa Fe Community College campus. It includes laboratories, classrooms and offices dedicated to training students for careers in health and sciences professions. The building also houses a dental clinic operated by Santa Fes La Familia Medical Center, a 20-chair clinic which provides dental health services to families and individuals in need, while also serving as a clinical training site for SFCC dental technician students.<br>
<br>
The building expands laboratory space for SFCC&#39;s health and sciences programs by offering three new nursing labs, two biology labs, one dental lab and two static labs for Emergency Medical Service Institute training. The building will also feature simulations labs, complete with human patient simulators and a central observation room. The building is arranged around two courtyards of differing character which provide outdoor spaces for students to gather, study, eat or take a break between classes.<br>
<br>
Project:  Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute (LEED Gold Registered)<br>
Country: Toronto, Canada<br>
Contribution:<br>
The St. Michael’s Hospital Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute brings together leading edge research and medical education programs within a single facility, seeking to accelerate the translation of research-based discoveries to front-line healthcare applications. Named after two significant foundations, the Institute comprises two buildings, programmatically distinct, yet physically integrated by a tunnelled bridge: the Keenan Research Centre and the Li Ka Shing International Centre for Health Care Education. <br>
<br>
The Keenan Centre houses state-of-the-art wet bench laboratories with an emphasis towards cancer, kidney disease, vascular biology and trauma research, dry research facilities to support community-based healthcare research, and a leading edge animal care facility. The Li Ka Shing International Centre for Healthcare Education will enhance existing education programs in medicine, nursing and allied health in addition to providing new administrative offices for existing programs in the Education Centre. <br>
<br>
Project:  Papadakis Integrated Science Building,  Drexel University (LEED Gold Certified)<br>
Country: Philadelphia, USA<br>
Contribution:<br>
The new Papdakis Integrated Sciences Building is home to the Biosciences Department. Organized around a five storey atrium the building contains 32 state-of-the-art research labs, 8 teaching labs as well as specialized computer and paleontology laboratories. In addition to the laboratory wings, there are 40 faculty offices looking southwest on Woodlawn Walk. At the ground floor 7 classrooms and a 200 seat auditorium, provide for teaching spaces for the Biology Department and the wider University community. <br>
<br>
The atrium is activated by a four storey spiral staircase that provides open, transparent and convenient connection between disciplines, faculty and students. Balconies and lounges at each level provide opportunities for collegial collaboration and social interaction. A 22 foot wide, 80 foot high living biowall with 1500 plants is integrated into the building’s air handling system achieving an 80% air quality improvement and 30% reduction in energy consumption. Diamond Schmitt also designed the building as an integrated component of the teaching program, with Faculty and staff using air ports inserted in the wall to sample and analyze the air quality.<br>
<br>
Student and faculty lounges on every floor, dubbed collaboratories by faculty provide opportunities for meetings and small gatherings and are contained in a projecting glass volume on Chestnut Avenue. The Integrated Sciences Building possesses a high degree of internal transparency harvests natural light to the labs with expansive windows and the skylit atrium. The building, clad in Indiana limestone, and the elliptical glass volume of the lounges marking the principal entry, establish the new presence for Drexel in the academic core of Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
Project:   Computer Science and Engineering Building, <br>
              University of Michigan<br>
Country:  Detroit, Michigan<br>
Contribution:<br>
The Computer Science and Engineering building accommodates faculty offices, research labs, and teaching spaces on the North Campus of the University of Michigan.  <br>
<br>
The 102,000 square foot structure will meet the needs of approximately 900 undergraduates, 300 graduate students, and 51 faculty members currently spread throughout multiple facilities. It includes computing labs, classrooms (60 seat and 120 seat), conference rooms, and student project space all in a wireless environment. All Computer Science and Engineering faculty and staff, student offices and labs will be housed in the new building. <br>
<br>
High indoor environmental quality is a key feature of the building.  Each office is placed on the perimeter of the building, naturally lit, and has an operable window.  Daylight is into the building by using transom windows in corridors, and through the extensive placement of skylights that cover a four-storey atrium space and a long linear stair. One of the primary goals of the project was to bring together all CSE faculty into one building to foster interaction in a stimulating environment. The visibility afforded by the generous central atrium space, around which all labs and offices are organized, will provide a great sense of community among the CSE faculty, students and staff and encourage positive interaction within and among research groups.<br>
