            Sentinel Principle®<br>
<br>
The Sentinel Principle® is based on the premise that as blood circulates through the body, communication occurs between cells in blood and tissue. These cell-cell interactions induce changes in blood gene expression. Profiling these changes enables the Company to identify unique molecular signatures reflecting disease activity which can then be used to develop disease-specific molecular diagnostic assays. The Company uses the Sentinel Principle® to develop disease-specific blood-based biomarkers as the basis for molecular diagnostics tests and to enable personalized health management through the development of systems biology tools and algorithms.<br>
<br>
The advantage of blood-based diagnostic tests derived from the application of the Sentinel Principle® is that blood samples can be obtained readily with little discomfort to patients. Biomarkers derived from blood RNA provide an alternative to tissue biopsy for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. Some diseases such as colorectal cancer can be diagnosed only with invasive, uncomfortable tests like colonoscopy or with stool samples. Furthermore, some diseases, like ovarian cancer, are difficult to diagnose and often manifest themselves only once the disease is too advanced to treat successfully. The Sentinel Principle® is truly revolutionary for its breadth of application which enables comprehensive personalized health management. Simple blood testing may be used to pre-screen asymptomatic individuals to assess current risk, to detect previously difficult or cumbersome to diagnose conditions, often at an early stage when diseases like cancer are most curable, and for other applications such as staging disease, predicting response to treatment, and monitoring for disease recurrence.<br>
<br>
Discovery Funnel<br>
<br>
The Company has developed methods using computational tools and statistical methods in combination with various analytical tools to quickly and effectively identify disease-specific biomarkers through the application of the Sentinel Principle®.  This Discovery Funnel starts with the application of genome wide gene expression profiling using microarrays to a defined cohort of patient samples and control samples.  Microarray data analysis results in the identification of several hundred genes from the roughly 25,000 genes present in the human genome that have the ability to distinguish between the patient cohort and the control cohort, for example, to distinguish patients with colorectal cancer from those without colorectal cancer. Certain selection criteria are applied to this list of several hundred genes to identify candidate genes for validation using another gene expression measuring method, qRT-PCR.  The Company generally selects about 50 genes that are validated by qRT-PCR and then analyzed in various combinations to generate panels of between two to eight genes that are able to distinguish between disease and control patients with good sensitivity and specificity.  The selected panels are then validated against blind samples.<br>
<br>
The Discovery Funnel is a proprietary process developed by the Company that can rapidly and effectively select a handful of informative biomarkers from the approximately 25,000 genes that comprise the human genome to generate much needed content for molecular diagnostic tests to address unmet clinical needs.  This advantage is augmented since the Companys Sentinel Principle® technology is one that exploits one of the most accessible and patient-accepted biological samples for clinical applications, a simple blood sample.<br>
<br>
ColonSentry<br>
<br>
The Company has commercialized its first product, ColonSentry, a blood-based molecular test, to assess an individuals current risk of having colorectal cancer.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women and the most common cause of cancer deaths in non-smokers.  When diagnosed after the onset of symptoms, the prognosis is poor.  However, if detected and treated early before the cancer has spread and generally before symptoms appear, more than ninety percent of patients may survive the disease.  As a result, it is currently recommended by the American Cancer Society that all individuals aged fifty or older undergo screening for colorectal cancer on a regular basis.  Despite the proven ability of screening programs to prevent colorectal cancer deaths, most patients do not adhere to screening guidelines.  In the United States, about 45% of individuals comply.  In Canada, screening compliance is around 15 percent.  Lack of compliance is the primary reason for the high death rate and appears to be directly related to the reluctance that many patients have to undergo colonoscopy or stool-based testing.  <br>
<br>
The Company believes that a blood-based test to pre-screen asymptomatic individuals would facilitate colorectal cancer screening and capture a substantial portion of the market that is currently dominated by stool- and endoscopy-based tests.  More importantly, ColonSentry would encourage compliance by the vast majority of patients who are currently unwilling to accept stool- or endoscopy-based tests.  The potential power of blood-based testing for cancer is evidenced by the widespread use of the PSA test, even though this test for prostate cancer has a high incidence of false negative and false positive tests.  Approximately 40 million PSA tests are performed annually and the compliance rate for screening with PSA is reported to be 55% in Canada with higher compliance rates in the U.S.<br>
<br>
ColonSentry is a qRT-PCR test performed on RNA isolated from whole blood.  The Company launched a LDT version of ColonSentry in Canada in July 2008 and entered into strategic marketing partnerships with Enzo Clinical Labs in New York and New Jersey in the U.S. (2009), with GeneDiagnostics in Shanghai and the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu in China (2010) and with GeneNews Diagnostics for commercialization in Malaysia and southeast Asia (2010).  The Company is also in discussion with potential partners to market ColonSentry in selected countries in Asia and Europe.  The ColonSentry test service requires the collection of a blood sample which is delivered to a clinical reference laboratory for processing to generate the test result.  The test result is then sent directly to the patients referring physician.  <br>
<br>
Sentry Pipeline<br>
<br>
In addition to colorectal cancer, the Company has applied the Sentinel Principle to identify biomarkers for a pipeline of other diseases such as prostate, bladder and ovarian cancers, as well as cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders and arthritis. It is expected that the test format and general components (reagents and software) will be similar for all tests, therefore product development and commercialization of subsequent products as LDTs is expected to be easier and faster than for ColonSentry.<br>
<br>
The Company has successfully established collaborations and alliances with leading institutions to access well-defined clinical sample and data sets as well as expert clinical guidance and insight from respected leaders in cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders.  The Company has established relationships with many leading institutions including Brigham and Womens Hospital of Harvard Medical School, University Health Network at University of Toronto, University of California at San Francisco, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, New York University School of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, Stanford University in California, Lam Wah Ee and Mount Miriam Hospitals in Malaysia, and a number of colonoscopy screening clinics in Canada and the U.S.<br>
<br>
The Company has been actively pursuing a prostate cancer program and presented the findings from its early work in this area at the 2006 ASCO meeting in an abstract entitled Blood-based biomarkers for detecting aggressive prostate cancer at time of biopsy.  In August 2007, the Company signed a two-year agreement with an Asian biomedical consortium to develop blood-based biomarkers for the detection and management of prostate diseases.  Under the agreement, the consortium was to provide U.S. $2.0 million to GeneNews to identify biomarkers related to prostate disease using its proprietary Sentinel Principle and Discovery Funnel technologies. If a biomarker panel is successfully identified, GeneNews will then develop, validate and commercialize a prostate disease test, ProstateSentry, based on these biomarkers.  All intellectual property arising from this agreement would remain vested in GeneNews.  The work to support this program has been largely carried out at the Companys Malaysian facility and has been completed.  Approximately $36,000 (USD 37,456) remains unpaid by the Asian biomedical consortium.  <br>
<br>
Effective June 21, 2010, the Companys Malaysia subsidiary signed and initiated an Agreement in Strategic Alliance for the Development of Diagnostic Biomarker Panels for Hepatitis and Liver Cancer (the Grant) with the Clinical Research Centre of the Government of Malaysia (the CRC of MOH) for a two year period totalling MYR 5,000,000.  GeneNews expects to receive a maximum of MYR 3,983,750, for specified salary and operating expenses, and the CRC of MOH will retain MYR 1,016,250 for capital asset purchases and their employee training expenses.  In 2010, the Company received total receipts of $1,051,763 (MYR 3,211,000). <br>
<br>
Personalized Health Management<br>
<br>
The Company has applied the Sentinel Principle® to more than 20 disease areas in its research as the basis for its long term vision of developing a personalized health management system.  This work also provides the basis for a broad portfolio of pending patents and know-how.  <br>
<br>
The Company has developed and implemented the first phase of a health information database.  Over time, the Company expects to develop applications to monitor overall health status and thus enable personalized health management.  Preliminary data suggests that it will be possible to identify panels of biomarkers to distinguish a number of different diseases from a single blood sample and the Company is considering the development of a womens health panel and general cancer panel if sufficient capital and resources can be secured to pursue this work.<br>

            <div>The Companys global corporate headquarters and the clinical reference laboratory that was established to support the ColonSentry test service operates out of a 24,000 square foot leased facility in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada.  As of March 1, 2010, the Company had subleased approximately two-thirds of its leased premises to a third party.<br>
<br>
The Company also occupies a 1,021 square foot facility in Penang, Malaysia, where it has established a research and development facility to augment the Companys overall capacity.  Laboratory facilities are available in Tianjin, China, which served as a beta-testing site for ColonSentry.<br>
<br>
In 2007, the Company established a Clinical Reference Laboratory at its facility in Richmond Hill, Ontario to prepare for the commercial launch of its ColonSentry LDT product.  The Companys quality management system and Richmond Hill facilities were recognized with an ISO13485 certification on March 6, 2008.  Subsequently, the Company decided to pursue ISO 9001:2000 certification in place of ISO13485 in light of the Companys decision to defer the pursuit of IVD test kit design and development activities.  The Company achieved ISO 9001:2000 certification, effective June 26, 2009, and successfully completed the ISO 9001:2008 upgrade audit on March 2, 2010 and surveillance audit on January 6, 2011.  The development of a ColonSentry IVD test kit requires substantial additional resources and will only be pursued by the Company in the near-term in collaboration with one or more strategic partners.<br>

            Sentinel Principle®<br>
<br>
The Sentinel Principle® is based on the premise that as blood circulates through the body, communication occurs between cells in blood and tissue. These cell-cell interactions induce changes in blood gene expression. Profiling these changes enables the Company to identify unique molecular signatures reflecting disease activity which can then be used to develop disease-specific molecular diagnostic assays. The Company uses the Sentinel Principle® to develop disease-specific blood-based biomarkers as the basis for molecular diagnostics tests and to enable personalized health management through the development of systems biology tools and algorithms.<br>
<br>
The advantage of blood-based diagnostic tests derived from the application of the Sentinel Principle® is that blood samples can be obtained readily with little discomfort to patients. Biomarkers derived from blood RNA provide an alternative to tissue biopsy for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. Some diseases such as colorectal cancer can be diagnosed only with invasive, uncomfortable tests like colonoscopy or with stool samples. Furthermore, some diseases, like ovarian cancer, are difficult to diagnose and often manifest themselves only once the disease is too advanced to treat successfully. The Sentinel Principle® is truly revolutionary for its breadth of application which enables comprehensive personalized health management. Simple blood testing may be used to pre-screen asymptomatic individuals to assess current risk, to detect previously difficult or cumbersome to diagnose conditions, often at an early stage when diseases like cancer are most curable, and for other applications such as staging disease, predicting response to treatment, and monitoring for disease recurrence.<br>
<br>
Discovery Funnel<br>
<br>
The Company has developed methods using computational tools and statistical methods in combination with various analytical tools to quickly and effectively identify disease-specific biomarkers through the application of the Sentinel Principle®.  This Discovery Funnel starts with the application of genome wide gene expression profiling using microarrays to a defined cohort of patient samples and control samples.  Microarray data analysis results in the identification of several hundred genes from the roughly 25,000 genes present in the human genome that have the ability to distinguish between the patient cohort and the control cohort, for example, to distinguish patients with colorectal cancer from those without colorectal cancer. Certain selection criteria are applied to this list of several hundred genes to identify candidate genes for validation using another gene expression measuring method, qRT-PCR.  The Company generally selects about 50 genes that are validated by qRT-PCR and then analyzed in various combinations to generate panels of between two to eight genes that are able to distinguish between disease and control patients with good sensitivity and specificity.  The selected panels are then validated against blind samples.<br>
<br>
The Discovery Funnel is a proprietary process developed by the Company that can rapidly and effectively select a handful of informative biomarkers from the approximately 25,000 genes that comprise the human genome to generate much needed content for molecular diagnostic tests to address unmet clinical needs.  This advantage is augmented since the Companys Sentinel Principle® technology is one that exploits one of the most accessible and patient-accepted biological samples for clinical applications, a simple blood sample.<br>
<br>
ColonSentry<br>
<br>
The Company has commercialized its first product, ColonSentry, a blood-based molecular test, to assess an individuals current risk of having colorectal cancer.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women and the most common cause of cancer deaths in non-smokers.  When diagnosed after the onset of symptoms, the prognosis is poor.  However, if detected and treated early before the cancer has spread and generally before symptoms appear, more than ninety percent of patients may survive the disease.  As a result, it is currently recommended by the American Cancer Society that all individuals aged fifty or older undergo screening for colorectal cancer on a regular basis.  Despite the proven ability of screening programs to prevent colorectal cancer deaths, most patients do not adhere to screening guidelines.  In the United States, about 45% of individuals comply.  In Canada, screening compliance is around 15 percent.  Lack of compliance is the primary reason for the high death rate and appears to be directly related to the reluctance that many patients have to undergo colonoscopy or stool-based testing.  <br>
<br>
The Company believes that a blood-based test to pre-screen asymptomatic individuals would facilitate colorectal cancer screening and capture a substantial portion of the market that is currently dominated by stool- and endoscopy-based tests.  More importantly, ColonSentry would encourage compliance by the vast majority of patients who are currently unwilling to accept stool- or endoscopy-based tests.  The potential power of blood-based testing for cancer is evidenced by the widespread use of the PSA test, even though this test for prostate cancer has a high incidence of false negative and false positive tests.  Approximately 40 million PSA tests are performed annually and the compliance rate for screening with PSA is reported to be 55% in Canada with higher compliance rates in the U.S.<br>
<br>
ColonSentry is a qRT-PCR test performed on RNA isolated from whole blood.  The Company launched a LDT version of ColonSentry in Canada in July 2008 and entered into strategic marketing partnerships with Enzo Clinical Labs in New York and New Jersey in the U.S. (2009), with GeneDiagnostics in Shanghai and the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu in China (2010) and with GeneNews Diagnostics for commercialization in Malaysia and southeast Asia (2010).  The Company is also in discussion with potential partners to market ColonSentry in selected countries in Asia and Europe.  The ColonSentry test service requires the collection of a blood sample which is delivered to a clinical reference laboratory for processing to generate the test result.  The test result is then sent directly to the patients referring physician.  <br>
<br>
Sentry Pipeline<br>
<br>
In addition to colorectal cancer, the Company has applied the Sentinel Principle to identify biomarkers for a pipeline of other diseases such as prostate, bladder and ovarian cancers, as well as cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders and arthritis. It is expected that the test format and general components (reagents and software) will be similar for all tests, therefore product development and commercialization of subsequent products as LDTs is expected to be easier and faster than for ColonSentry.<br>
<br>
The Company has successfully established collaborations and alliances with leading institutions to access well-defined clinical sample and data sets as well as expert clinical guidance and insight from respected leaders in cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders.  The Company has established relationships with many leading institutions including Brigham and Womens Hospital of Harvard Medical School, University Health Network at University of Toronto, University of California at San Francisco, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, New York University School of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, Stanford University in California, Lam Wah Ee and Mount Miriam Hospitals in Malaysia, and a number of colonoscopy screening clinics in Canada and the U.S.<br>
<br>
The Company has been actively pursuing a prostate cancer program and presented the findings from its early work in this area at the 2006 ASCO meeting in an abstract entitled Blood-based biomarkers for detecting aggressive prostate cancer at time of biopsy.  In August 2007, the Company signed a two-year agreement with an Asian biomedical consortium to develop blood-based biomarkers for the detection and management of prostate diseases.  Under the agreement, the consortium was to provide U.S. $2.0 million to GeneNews to identify biomarkers related to prostate disease using its proprietary Sentinel Principle and Discovery Funnel technologies. If a biomarker panel is successfully identified, GeneNews will then develop, validate and commercialize a prostate disease test, ProstateSentry, based on these biomarkers.  All intellectual property arising from this agreement would remain vested in GeneNews.  The work to support this program has been largely carried out at the Companys Malaysian facility and has been completed.  Approximately $36,000 (USD 37,456) remains unpaid by the Asian biomedical consortium.  <br>
<br>
Effective June 21, 2010, the Companys Malaysia subsidiary signed and initiated an Agreement in Strategic Alliance for the Development of Diagnostic Biomarker Panels for Hepatitis and Liver Cancer (the Grant) with the Clinical Research Centre of the Government of Malaysia (the CRC of MOH) for a two year period totalling MYR 5,000,000.  GeneNews expects to receive a maximum of MYR 3,983,750, for specified salary and operating expenses, and the CRC of MOH will retain MYR 1,016,250 for capital asset purchases and their employee training expenses.  In 2010, the Company received total receipts of $1,051,763 (MYR 3,211,000). <br>
<br>
Personalized Health Management<br>
<br>
The Company has applied the Sentinel Principle® to more than 20 disease areas in its research as the basis for its long term vision of developing a personalized health management system.  This work also provides the basis for a broad portfolio of pending patents and know-how.  <br>
<br>
The Company has developed and implemented the first phase of a health information database.  Over time, the Company expects to develop applications to monitor overall health status and thus enable personalized health management.  Preliminary data suggests that it will be possible to identify panels of biomarkers to distinguish a number of different diseases from a single blood sample and the Company is considering the development of a womens health panel and general cancer panel if sufficient capital and resources can be secured to pursue this work.<br>

            <div>The Companys global corporate headquarters and the clinical reference laboratory that was established to support the ColonSentry test service operates out of a 24,000 square foot leased facility in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada.  As of March 1, 2010, the Company had subleased approximately two-thirds of its leased premises to a third party.<br>
<br>
The Company also occupies a 1,021 square foot facility in Penang, Malaysia, where it has established a research and development facility to augment the Companys overall capacity.  Laboratory facilities are available in Tianjin, China, which served as a beta-testing site for ColonSentry.<br>
<br>
In 2007, the Company established a Clinical Reference Laboratory at its facility in Richmond Hill, Ontario to prepare for the commercial launch of its ColonSentry LDT product.  The Companys quality management system and Richmond Hill facilities were recognized with an ISO13485 certification on March 6, 2008.  Subsequently, the Company decided to pursue ISO 9001:2000 certification in place of ISO13485 in light of the Companys decision to defer the pursuit of IVD test kit design and development activities.  The Company achieved ISO 9001:2000 certification, effective June 26, 2009, and successfully completed the ISO 9001:2008 upgrade audit on March 2, 2010 and surveillance audit on January 6, 2011.  The development of a ColonSentry IVD test kit requires substantial additional resources and will only be pursued by the Company in the near-term in collaboration with one or more strategic partners.<br>
