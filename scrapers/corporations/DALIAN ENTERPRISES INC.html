                            IT Enterprise Infrastructure is a business critical resource enabling employees, third parties, support staff and the public to make use of business information assets and resources. Resources include information sources such as documents, databases, web sites and email, as well as business assets including Workstations, Servers, PDAs and Printers.<br>
<br>
While business requires that assets and resources are accessible, available and resilient, these requirements must be balanced against the need to mitigate risks to the organization from a wide range of potential and real threats from both external and internal sources.<br>
<br>
It is reasonable to conclude from published evidence that the primary motive for the majority of attacks is financial with defamation some way behind. In effect, this makes everyone a likely target, citizens and corporations, since we all have bank accounts, investments and/or removable assets. Just as in house burglary, the opportunistic attacker is the most prolific and there are a host of ready-made tools available on the Internet to use with relative ease. Script Kiddies, those that download and run hacking software with little or no understanding of the technologies, use many of these tools to exploit known weaknesses in networks, operating systems and applications and, with Internet access available almost everywhere, the attack vectors have multiplied considerably in a few short years. The graphic shows that exploitation of known and easily remedied issues still top the charts as they have for the last several years.<br>

                            Todays networks are becoming more compact at the Local Area Network (LAN) layer with the deployment of many types of Switch Fabric infrastructure. These Virtual Switch technologies offer many business benefits including reduced cost of ownership, scalability and rapid adaptability to change. Many are Virtual Machine (VM) aware and fit smoothly into the established market for VM technologies such as VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V. This is why they are being heavily utilized in virtual environments such as private clouds, data centres and proof of concept platforms.<br>
<br>
Whether they are at the core, aggregation layer or at the network edge, virtual networking products offer the flexibility, scalability and security normally only associated with high end switches. Virtual switching chassis can be populated with as few as 24 ports to begin with and can grow as large as is required to satisfy business requirements. Virtual switching extends beyond the single switch to encompass many chassis enabling Network Administrators to quickly adapt to changing business needs without having to procure additional wiring, closets or patch panels.<br>

DALIANs Data Centre and Virtualization Portfolio offers products and services that are suitable for all sizes of installation and requirement.<br>

                            IT Enterprise Infrastructure is a business critical resource enabling employees, third parties, support staff and the public to make use of business information assets and resources. Resources include information sources such as documents, databases, web sites and email, as well as business assets including Workstations, Servers, PDAs and Printers.<br>
<br>
While business requires that assets and resources are accessible, available and resilient, these requirements must be balanced against the need to mitigate risks to the organization from a wide range of potential and real threats from both external and internal sources.<br>
<br>
It is reasonable to conclude from published evidence that the primary motive for the majority of attacks is financial with defamation some way behind. In effect, this makes everyone a likely target, citizens and corporations, since we all have bank accounts, investments and/or removable assets. Just as in house burglary, the opportunistic attacker is the most prolific and there are a host of ready-made tools available on the Internet to use with relative ease. Script Kiddies, those that download and run hacking software with little or no understanding of the technologies, use many of these tools to exploit known weaknesses in networks, operating systems and applications and, with Internet access available almost everywhere, the attack vectors have multiplied considerably in a few short years. The graphic shows that exploitation of known and easily remedied issues still top the charts as they have for the last several years.<br>

                            Todays networks are becoming more compact at the Local Area Network (LAN) layer with the deployment of many types of Switch Fabric infrastructure. These Virtual Switch technologies offer many business benefits including reduced cost of ownership, scalability and rapid adaptability to change. Many are Virtual Machine (VM) aware and fit smoothly into the established market for VM technologies such as VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V. This is why they are being heavily utilized in virtual environments such as private clouds, data centres and proof of concept platforms.<br>
<br>
Whether they are at the core, aggregation layer or at the network edge, virtual networking products offer the flexibility, scalability and security normally only associated with high end switches. Virtual switching chassis can be populated with as few as 24 ports to begin with and can grow as large as is required to satisfy business requirements. Virtual switching extends beyond the single switch to encompass many chassis enabling Network Administrators to quickly adapt to changing business needs without having to procure additional wiring, closets or patch panels.<br>
<br>
DALIANs Data Centre and Virtualization Portfolio offers products and services that are suitable for all sizes of installation and requirement.<br>
