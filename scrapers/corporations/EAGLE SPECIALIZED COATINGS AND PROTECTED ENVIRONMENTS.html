                            SUPER THERM ceramic insulation coating is only the thickness of a business card but offers an Effective R value of RE19. SUPER THERM is a true &quot; insulating &quot; coating and not just a reflective paint as are all the competing formulas in the market. Also tested by the Thermo Physical Research Laboratory for comparative R19 equivalent insulation factor SUPERTHERM blocked 92% of the heat. No other R19 equivalent insulator can claim that!. No Fiberglass, No Foam, No Cellulose, No other single ceramic paint!<br>
<br>
SUPERTHERM is a unique combination of high performance aliphatic urethanes, elastomeric acrylics, standard acrylics and resin additives in a water based formula. No co-solvents are present and will dry by evaporation. Due to the unique combination of acrylics and urethanes, SUPERTHERM cures out completely in 14 days to an extremely tough, durable, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that also provides flexibility, water proofing and UV stability. SUPERTHERM has passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which equals marine specifications and in fact has DNV certification. SUPERTHERM was built to meet the requirements of industrial uses which required a tough surface, and provide flexibility against stresses of contraction and expansion. Also, unlike all other  &quot; reflective &quot; coatings on the market which offer only a single reflective ceramic to provide heat reflection, SUPERTHERM is designed with four separate ceramic compounds for insulation from radiant heat, reflection, conduction and convection. SUPERTHERM ceramics are not the rough multifaceted type as the one found in other coatings, SUPERTHERM ceramics are ground to form microscopic spheres. The spherical shape permits the 4 types of ceramics to settle very tight together, not allowing air to interact between the ceramics; thus &quot;plating&quot;. Therefore, SUPERTHERM is a true insulating coat not just a reflective coat as are all the competing formulas in the market. <br>
Also tested by the Thermo Physical Research Laboratory for comparative R19 effective insulation factor SUPERTHERM blocked 92%+ of the heat. No other R19 equivalent insulator can claim that!. No Fiberglass, No Foam, No Cellulose, No other single ceramic paint! SUPERTHERM&#39;s two reflective ceramics reflect sunlight and radiant heat, while the third ceramic compound works to stop heat and / or cold conduction through the coating film. The fourth ceramic blocks almost all infrared. The combination of acrylics provide elasticity and toughness while the urethane binds the acrylics and compounds, also providing a moisture barrier. The fourth resin additive is what makes the complete resin blend to combine into a single component and extends the life of the coating.<br>
<br>
~ Two ceramic compounds are primarily to repel radiation and offer reflective abilities. <br>
~ One ceramic compound is to stop heat conduction by hollow <br>
sphere technology which is not glass. <br>
~ One ceramic compound is designed specifically for stopping <br>
Infrared Radiation to control the heat gain to the interior of buildings or equipment. This new compound was introduced in February 2000 as part of our continued research in controlling heat transfer.<br>
~ This resin / ceramic combination has been shown to reflect both heat, fire, withstand elements for 30 to 40 years, endure 180 degree bend without cracking, resist water and ultraviolet light.<br>

                            RUSTGRIP is a one-part polyurethane coating that combines with atmospheric moisture to cure. Upon curing, RUSTGRIP provides a protective coating of superior adhesion, flexibility and abrasion \ impact resistance. It is resistant to chemical solvents and acid splash. Originally designed for metal surfaces, RUSTGRIP demonstrates excellent adhesion to wood, concrete, fiberglass and many other substrates. RUSTGRIP is designed for the encapsulation of and adherence to tightly bonded surfaces of lead based and other toxic paints and materials as well as rusted surfaces. This unique ability is accomplished by the curing mechanism of the base polymer. The coating ( having a low initial viscosity ) wets the rusty surface, then penetrates to the foundation of the rust&#39;s origin where curing begins. RUSTGRIP actually becomes part of the substrate unlike a surface coating which just bonds on top. The polymer literally begins to swell, developing an interlocking network between the pores of the surface and the coating. RUSTGRIP is highly recommended as a primer coat for SUPERTHERM. No pot life, no catalyzation, no two-part mixing. RUSTGRIP is not a sacrificial rust inhibitor such as a zinc enriched primer that will wear out over time but in fact a permanent rust proofing which is why it is a certified ( ASTM E1795 ) Biohazard Encapsulator. RUSTGRIP has also passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which are marine specifications and consequently has achieved DNV certification. Can substitute for zinc-rich primer requiring no white sandblasting. Can be applied over rusted surfaces after loose \ flaking material is removed.<br>

                            ENAMOGRIP ANTI GRAFFITI TOUGH COATING FOR LOW MAINTENANCE ON ALL SURFACES available in 650 COLOURS or CLEAR in HIGH GLOSS or LOW LUSTRE.<br>
ENAMOGRIP is a tough, medium speed, moisture curing, two component polyurethane enamel, which produces a uniquely hard and durable coating film. ENAMOGRIP will demonstrate unsurpassed semi gloss retention, color retention, and chalk resistance, when utilized for exterior coating situations. ENAMOGRIP will provide outstanding resistance to water and humidity, stains, chemicals, and solvents, as well as tremendous scuff, mar, and impact resistance. Ideal for use on bridges applied over RUST GRIP or by itself for complete encapsulation of the metal, providing protection from rust and corrosion for a minimum of 20 years in normal circumstances. Resistant to hail damage and similar abuses that create opportunities for rust and corrosion. Completely UV- controlled and weather resistant. ENAMOGRIP is a self leveling formula for an outstanding finish. ENAMOGRIP can be used on flooring for a tough, long wearing surface but precise measures must be taken to insure a completely clean surface free from moisture and residues to adhere to. In summary, the overall toughness, durability, and weather resistance of ENAMOGRIP polyurethane enamels, make them the ideal choice for demanding product applications for architectural maintenance situations that require the utmost in exterior durability. ENAMOGRIP is an ambient/slow moisture-cure coating.<br>
<br>
GRAFFITI PROOF RESISTANCE:<br>
After ENAMOGRIP has been applied and allowed to cure for at least 24 hours, applications of &quot;Krylon&quot; spray paint, Magic Markers, etc. can be wiped off conpletely with Superior&#39;s specially-blended graffiti cleaner. The color white may show a slight shadow but all dark colors are completely clear of graffiti markings. ENAMOGRIP can withstand years of graffiti removal as it is not affected by solvents and does not breathe to allow spray paints or oils to penetrate its surface.<br>

SUNSHIELD ~ WALL \ ROOF \ CEILING \ FLOOR ELASTOMERIC COATING for ALL SURFACES.<br>
SUNSHIELD is an emulsion combining high performance acrylic resins in water. This special acrylic combination presents a high performance sealing acrylic that, when applied to porous substrates such as concrete or masonry surfaces, will fill and seal itself securely with the substrate. The other acrylic in the combination helps to toughen the sealing film to stop moisture penetration on walls and \ or roofing. This resin combination is designed to withstand ponding water on roofing, if so required. SUNSHIELD 2000 tenaciously adheres to metal, wood, fiberglass and all other substrates, as well. It contains no co-solvents and will dry by evaporation. SUNSHIELD will dry out completely in one week to a durable, very flexible, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that is ultraviolet stable. SUNSHIELD was designed to meet the needs of an exterior roof or wall coating that requires flexibility, yet has a need for some toughness. Able to withstand the structural stresses as well as thermal stresses experienced by temperature \ climate or seasonal swings. The heat repelling ability provided by SUNSHIELD was designed from the same ceramic package as SUPERTHERM for insulation effectiveness equal to 4-6 inches of batt insulation materials.<br>

HOT PIPE COATING was built to be used as the initial primer coating and high build coating applied over hot pipes or other high temperature surfaces to achieve immediate adhesion while calming down the hot surface. Using this coating as the primer and base coat, we can achieve adhesion over the hot surface and create a surface that is insulated to stop heat flow. It is waterborne to offer a nonflammable, non toxic formula for high heat situations.<br>

                            Mid Temp (400° F \ 204° C) HOT SURFACE COATING ® is specifically engineered for hot surface temperatures ranging between 65° C - 204° C \ 150° F - 400° F. It resembles SUPER THERM ® in appearance and smoothness. This is a water-borne system using a special acrylic blend with specific ceramic compounds to provide the non-conductive block against heat transfer. The coating does not depend upon reflectivity but on the non-conductive ceramic compounds to block heat transfer. The coating will dry down on a cold surface by evaporation and can be aided in the dry down by adding heat to the environment. If the surface is already heated, the dry-down process will take care of itself without additional steps to be taken. It can be used as the primer coat to block heat and, if subject to weathering, apply SUPER THERM ® as the top coat.<br>
<br>
HOT SURFACE COATING ® is water-borne to offer a non-flammable, non-toxic formula for medium heat surface applications over standard steam pipes, oven wall construction and other hot surfaces. This coating was designed for applications whose temperature exposures fall between what the SUPER THERM ® insulative / reflective can do ( maximum surface temperature of 93° C \ 200° F ) and what the higher temperature HOT PIPE COATING ® provides ( up to 492° C \ 900° F ).<br>
CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY USED IN THIS PRODUCT:<br>
Superior Products International has been experimenting with and developing the uses of &quot;insulation and fire protection&quot; ceramics for over 15 years. This category of ceramic functionality is new to the engineering fields. Only in recent years has the idea of insulation been associated with this new breed of ceramics. <br>
<br>
Superior Products International knew that this area had not been thoroughly explored before, nor had any extensive documentation been presented for this application. In contrast, many articles and studies have been devoted to the abrasion resistant ceramic compounds and how they can be used in manufacturing and industrial markets.<br>
<br>
Insulative ceramics are completely different and separate from those used for abrasion resistance. No extensive studies have been performed to determine which ceramic compounds, either natural or man made would be best suited for eliminating heat transfer. Some studies have acknowledged the &quot;reflection&quot; of heat by mere radiation of sunlight but since very limited study has been performed, it was thought that reflection was all that this new category of ceramic could provide.<br>
<br>
<br>
Superior Products International initially worked in the early 1990&#39;s with the aid of the ceramic engineers at the Marshall Space Center Laboratories, and it was discovered that no real research had been performed across the broad spectrum of possible ceramic compounds in order to determine the scope of ceramics stopping or slowing &quot;heat conduction&quot; rather than merely radiant heat reflection. It was also decided that Superior Products International would continue the R&amp;D work over the next several years to discover the possibilities of this new design of ceramics. An extensive search was organized and begun to locate all possible types of ceramics compounds in the world market for trial-and-error testing. A system was designed to take each compound through a series of heat conduction tests to find its ability to stop heat conduction. More than 1,500 compounds were received and tested. From this R&amp;D period, eight different compounds were identified as having the ability not only to catch and throw heat away from their surfaces in a manner similar to reflection but also to control heat transfer via conduction.<br>
<br>
Superior Products International chose three of these ceramic compounds to develop its insulation coating called SUPER THERM ®. A fourth ceramic was added in 2000 as part of our continued research in controlling heat transfer. This is a thin film coating that will protect against heat migration equal to six inches of fiberglass batt insulation when applied over surfaces facing the heat source. SUNSHIELD ® is inferior to SUPER THERM ® but is still superior to any of the cheap imitations on the market. SUNSHIELD ® is less expensive because the Fire ceramic \ resistance and urethane \ toughness have been left out. SUNSHIELD 2000 ® does have the same dual acrylics and similar multi ceramic insulation package. EPOXOTHERM® likewise has a similar multi ceramic insulation package but in an Epoxy carrier. Epoxies are required for application to wet substrates such as in the case of extreme condensation.<br>
<br>
Eight of the ceramic compounds were also chosen to work in combination with one another in high heat situations. HOT PIPE COATING ® ( up to 900° F \ 482° C ) and HOT SURFACE COATING ® (from 65° C - 177° C / 150° F - 350° F ) were developed to capture surface heat and stop thermal transfer via conduction. OMEGA FIRE ® will glaze and harden to stop flame, smoke or gas penetration and has a 3 hour Fire Resistance Rating. As with all of our protective coatings, each one is specifically engineered to solve a particular problem under a wide variety of application requirements and conditions.<br>

              <h4>
                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              Heavy Industry:<br>
In the US, Hoechst-Celanese Chemical Plant in Houston, Texas had been having problems with keeping their hazardous waste incinerators ( operating @ 1600F ) on-line due to the heat and dripping unburned acids ( during the cooling on shut down ). The combination of heat, condensation and unburned acids caused the bottom of the incinerator to totally corrode, forcing complete replacement approximately every 4-6 months. Costs exceeded $.25 million USD per shut down for repairs and lost production which occurred twice per year. The engineer decided to try using our RUSTGRIP primer and then SUPERTHERM as the top coat at 30 mils DFT to protect the skin of the incinerator from the heat and effects of the condensation and acid. They were applied in February 1992, and to this date, has not required downtime due to corrosion of the skin. During this time period, approximately $6 million USD has been saved in downtime alone by using the designed protective coating system. SUPER THERM was tested and approved by Ontario Hydro in Ontario, Canada as the most effective insulator available for their tanks, pipes and buildings. Infrared video was filmed showing the effectiveness of SUPERTHERM&#39;s insulation ability over fiberglass, polyester foam, white paint and other types of conventional insulation by visually demonstrating the escape of heat for the protected surface. SUPER THERM outperformed all other insulation materials. The blast furnace door at the GVRD waste incinerator was coated with 28 mils DFT of SUPERTHERM to bring the surface temperature down from 150C to 70C to meet Canadian codes for any surface exposed to human contact. After coating but before full cure a check was made with the computerized control room and the operator immediately cut back the jets due to the increased heat retention again paying for itself in reduced energy consumption.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Transportation Industry:<br>
SUPERTHERM is being applied in numerous areas in the Transportation Industry. It is reducing the fuel consumption on Reefer units by 30%. It is being applied to all the UPS trucks. It is specified by Vancouver Shipyards on all new construction to control condensation such as all the passageways on the new Kootenay Lake Ferry. It is applied to the interior of yachts for acoustical insulation as well as to increase comfort. It was also applied to the exterior superstructure of an oil tanker for thermal control.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Recreational Facilities:<br>
As reported in Rink Magazine SUPER THERM is substantially reducing utility costs on various arenas. As stated by director Dwayne Lowdermilk, National Training Rinks ( pre-engineered stress skin metal structure ) experienced a &quot; 30% reduction in utility costs, which we sure appreciate &quot;.<br>
<br>
As noted by Kirk Fisher, P. Eng. , MBA, and the Development Manager for the Lark Group, the application of $30,000 of bulk insulation ( foam ) at the Excellent Ice facility ( pre-engineered stress skin metal structure ) located in Kirland, PQ and &quot; the gas and hydro bill didn&#39;t change at all &quot;. The SUPERTHERM was doing all the work and consequently it is specified on the Surrey, BC expansion and all other ice arena developments.<br>
<br>
On the Alberni Valley Multiplex ( tilt up concrete ) a system of SUNSHIELD 2000 and SUPER THERM was applied. In May 2002 the first year audit was completed on this facility and of special interest was the fact that the cycles on the compressors were far below expectations thus resulting in major energy savings as well as longer life for the equipment itself !<br>
<br>
At the Bonaire Golf Club the application of SUPERTHERM &quot; saved the purchase of another air conditioner plus all it&#39;s related energy and maintenance costs, plus we are using the existing two units less and our building is more comfortable. Your product will help Ontario&#39;s energy problem. &quot;
           

        
                
    

    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                International capital projects:
              </h4>
         
              Manufacturing Facilities:<br>
To date more than 5 million square feet of roofing has been protected in Japan alone using SUPER THERM for such companies as Canon, Hitachi, Kirin Brewery, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Sony, Sumitomo, to name a few. Sony Engineering group conducted field studies at the Koda factory and determined that the kW usage was reduced from 3,764 kW in May 1994 to 519 kW in May 1995 a reduction of 3,248 kW or 86%. The kW usage in June 1994 was 5,647 kW which was reduced to 1,869 kW in June 1995 which was a reduction of 3,778 kW. This resulted in a payback of 13 months. As a consequence SUPER THERM was specified on their new 700,000 square foot facility in Malaysia.<br>
<br>
SUPERTHERM was applied on a manufacturing facility in Kansas that was experiencing a great deal of difficulty in cooling various unconditioned buildings of the factory due to variance in size and significant volume. The results were an immediate reduction by 12 degrees Fahrenheit on the lower levels, with an even greater reduction to the attic storage and overhead work zones on the second story. This temperature reduction enabled the facility to utilize simple ceiling fans for cooling during the summer months, and thereby lowering the overall expense of energy.

                            SUPER THERM ceramic insulation coating is only the thickness of a business card but offers an Effective R value of RE19. SUPER THERM is a true &quot; insulating &quot; coating and not just a reflective paint as are all the competing formulas in the market. Also tested by the Thermo Physical Research Laboratory for comparative R19 equivalent insulation factor SUPERTHERM blocked 92% of the heat. No other R19 equivalent insulator can claim that!. No Fiberglass, No Foam, No Cellulose, No other single ceramic paint!<br>
<br>
SUPERTHERM is a unique combination of high performance aliphatic urethanes, elastomeric acrylics, standard acrylics and resin additives in a water based formula. No co-solvents are present and will dry by evaporation. Due to the unique combination of acrylics and urethanes, SUPERTHERM cures out completely in 14 days to an extremely tough, durable, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that also provides flexibility, water proofing and UV stability. SUPERTHERM has passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which equals marine specifications and in fact has DNV certification. SUPERTHERM was built to meet the requirements of industrial uses which required a tough surface, and provide flexibility against stresses of contraction and expansion. Also, unlike all other  &quot; reflective &quot; coatings on the market which offer only a single reflective ceramic to provide heat reflection, SUPERTHERM is designed with four separate ceramic compounds for insulation from radiant heat, reflection, conduction and convection. SUPERTHERM ceramics are not the rough multifaceted type as the one found in other coatings, SUPERTHERM ceramics are ground to form microscopic spheres. The spherical shape permits the 4 types of ceramics to settle very tight together, not allowing air to interact between the ceramics; thus &quot;plating&quot;. Therefore, SUPERTHERM is a true insulating coat not just a reflective coat as are all the competing formulas in the market. <br>
Also tested by the Thermo Physical Research Laboratory for comparative R19 effective insulation factor SUPERTHERM blocked 92%+ of the heat. No other R19 equivalent insulator can claim that!. No Fiberglass, No Foam, No Cellulose, No other single ceramic paint! SUPERTHERM&#39;s two reflective ceramics reflect sunlight and radiant heat, while the third ceramic compound works to stop heat and / or cold conduction through the coating film. The fourth ceramic blocks almost all infrared. The combination of acrylics provide elasticity and toughness while the urethane binds the acrylics and compounds, also providing a moisture barrier. The fourth resin additive is what makes the complete resin blend to combine into a single component and extends the life of the coating.<br>
<br>
~ Two ceramic compounds are primarily to repel radiation and offer reflective abilities. <br>
~ One ceramic compound is to stop heat conduction by hollow <br>
sphere technology which is not glass. <br>
~ One ceramic compound is designed specifically for stopping <br>
Infrared Radiation to control the heat gain to the interior of buildings or equipment. This new compound was introduced in February 2000 as part of our continued research in controlling heat transfer.<br>
~ This resin / ceramic combination has been shown to reflect both heat, fire, withstand elements for 30 to 40 years, endure 180 degree bend without cracking, resist water and ultraviolet light.<br>

                            RUSTGRIP is a one-part polyurethane coating that combines with atmospheric moisture to cure. Upon curing, RUSTGRIP provides a protective coating of superior adhesion, flexibility and abrasion \ impact resistance. It is resistant to chemical solvents and acid splash. Originally designed for metal surfaces, RUSTGRIP demonstrates excellent adhesion to wood, concrete, fiberglass and many other substrates. RUSTGRIP is designed for the encapsulation of and adherence to tightly bonded surfaces of lead based and other toxic paints and materials as well as rusted surfaces. This unique ability is accomplished by the curing mechanism of the base polymer. The coating ( having a low initial viscosity ) wets the rusty surface, then penetrates to the foundation of the rust&#39;s origin where curing begins. RUSTGRIP actually becomes part of the substrate unlike a surface coating which just bonds on top. The polymer literally begins to swell, developing an interlocking network between the pores of the surface and the coating. RUSTGRIP is highly recommended as a primer coat for SUPERTHERM. No pot life, no catalyzation, no two-part mixing. RUSTGRIP is not a sacrificial rust inhibitor such as a zinc enriched primer that will wear out over time but in fact a permanent rust proofing which is why it is a certified ( ASTM E1795 ) Biohazard Encapsulator. RUSTGRIP has also passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which are marine specifications and consequently has achieved DNV certification. Can substitute for zinc-rich primer requiring no white sandblasting. Can be applied over rusted surfaces after loose \ flaking material is removed.<br>

                            ENAMOGRIP ANTI GRAFFITI TOUGH COATING FOR LOW MAINTENANCE ON ALL SURFACES available in 650 COLOURS or CLEAR in HIGH GLOSS or LOW LUSTRE.<br>
ENAMOGRIP is a tough, medium speed, moisture curing, two component polyurethane enamel, which produces a uniquely hard and durable coating film. ENAMOGRIP will demonstrate unsurpassed semi gloss retention, color retention, and chalk resistance, when utilized for exterior coating situations. ENAMOGRIP will provide outstanding resistance to water and humidity, stains, chemicals, and solvents, as well as tremendous scuff, mar, and impact resistance. Ideal for use on bridges applied over RUST GRIP or by itself for complete encapsulation of the metal, providing protection from rust and corrosion for a minimum of 20 years in normal circumstances. Resistant to hail damage and similar abuses that create opportunities for rust and corrosion. Completely UV- controlled and weather resistant. ENAMOGRIP is a self leveling formula for an outstanding finish. ENAMOGRIP can be used on flooring for a tough, long wearing surface but precise measures must be taken to insure a completely clean surface free from moisture and residues to adhere to. In summary, the overall toughness, durability, and weather resistance of ENAMOGRIP polyurethane enamels, make them the ideal choice for demanding product applications for architectural maintenance situations that require the utmost in exterior durability. ENAMOGRIP is an ambient/slow moisture-cure coating.<br>
<br>
GRAFFITI PROOF RESISTANCE:<br>
After ENAMOGRIP has been applied and allowed to cure for at least 24 hours, applications of &quot;Krylon&quot; spray paint, Magic Markers, etc. can be wiped off conpletely with Superior&#39;s specially-blended graffiti cleaner. The color white may show a slight shadow but all dark colors are completely clear of graffiti markings. ENAMOGRIP can withstand years of graffiti removal as it is not affected by solvents and does not breathe to allow spray paints or oils to penetrate its surface.<br>

SUNSHIELD ~ WALL \ ROOF \ CEILING \ FLOOR ELASTOMERIC COATING for ALL SURFACES.<br>
SUNSHIELD is an emulsion combining high performance acrylic resins in water. This special acrylic combination presents a high performance sealing acrylic that, when applied to porous substrates such as concrete or masonry surfaces, will fill and seal itself securely with the substrate. The other acrylic in the combination helps to toughen the sealing film to stop moisture penetration on walls and \ or roofing. This resin combination is designed to withstand ponding water on roofing, if so required. SUNSHIELD 2000 tenaciously adheres to metal, wood, fiberglass and all other substrates, as well. It contains no co-solvents and will dry by evaporation. SUNSHIELD will dry out completely in one week to a durable, very flexible, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that is ultraviolet stable. SUNSHIELD was designed to meet the needs of an exterior roof or wall coating that requires flexibility, yet has a need for some toughness. Able to withstand the structural stresses as well as thermal stresses experienced by temperature \ climate or seasonal swings. The heat repelling ability provided by SUNSHIELD was designed from the same ceramic package as SUPERTHERM for insulation effectiveness equal to 4-6 inches of batt insulation materials.<br>

HOT PIPE COATING is a unique combination of high performance specialy designed high-temperature resins in a waterborne formula. HOT PIPE COATING was built to be used as the initial primer coating and high build coating applied over hot pipes or other high temperature surfaces to achieve immediate adhesion while calming down the hot surface. Using this coating as the primer and base coat, we can achieve adhesion over the hot surface and create a surface that is insulated to stop heat flow. It is waterborne to offer a nonflammable, non toxic formula for high heat situations.<br>

                            Mid Temp (400° F \ 204° C) HOT SURFACE COATING ® is specifically engineered for hot surface temperatures ranging between 65° C - 204° C \ 150° F - 400° F. It resembles SUPER THERM ® in appearance and smoothness. This is a water-borne system using a special acrylic blend with specific ceramic compounds to provide the non-conductive block against heat transfer. The coating does not depend upon reflectivity but on the non-conductive ceramic compounds to block heat transfer. The coating will dry down on a cold surface by evaporation and can be aided in the dry down by adding heat to the environment. If the surface is already heated, the dry-down process will take care of itself without additional steps to be taken. It can be used as the primer coat to block heat and, if subject to weathering, apply SUPER THERM ® as the top coat.<br>
<br>
HOT SURFACE COATING ® is water-borne to offer a non-flammable, non-toxic formula for medium heat surface applications over standard steam pipes, oven wall construction and other hot surfaces. This coating was designed for applications whose temperature exposures fall between what the SUPER THERM ® insulative / reflective can do ( maximum surface temperature of 93° C \ 200° F ) and what the higher temperature HOT PIPE COATING ® provides ( up to 492° C \ 900° F ).<br>
CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY USED IN THIS PRODUCT:<br>
Superior Products International has been experimenting with and developing the uses of &quot;insulation and fire protection&quot; ceramics for over 15 years. This category of ceramic functionality is new to the engineering fields. Only in recent years has the idea of insulation been associated with this new breed of ceramics. <br>
<br>
Superior Products International knew that this area had not been thoroughly explored before, nor had any extensive documentation been presented for this application. In contrast, many articles and studies have been devoted to the abrasion resistant ceramic compounds and how they can be used in manufacturing and industrial markets.<br>
<br>
Insulative ceramics are completely different and separate from those used for abrasion resistance. No extensive studies have been performed to determine which ceramic compounds, either natural or man made would be best suited for eliminating heat transfer. Some studies have acknowledged the &quot;reflection&quot; of heat by mere radiation of sunlight but since very limited study has been performed, it was thought that reflection was all that this new category of ceramic could provide.<br>
<br>
<br>
Superior Products International initially worked in the early 1990&#39;s with the aid of the ceramic engineers at the Marshall Space Center Laboratories, and it was discovered that no real research had been performed across the broad spectrum of possible ceramic compounds in order to determine the scope of ceramics stopping or slowing &quot;heat conduction&quot; rather than merely radiant heat reflection. It was also decided that Superior Products International would continue the R&amp;D work over the next several years to discover the possibilities of this new design of ceramics. An extensive search was organized and begun to locate all possible types of ceramics compounds in the world market for trial-and-error testing. A system was designed to take each compound through a series of heat conduction tests to find its ability to stop heat conduction. More than 1,500 compounds were received and tested. From this R&amp;D period, eight different compounds were identified as having the ability not only to catch and throw heat away from their surfaces in a manner similar to reflection but also to control heat transfer via conduction.<br>
<br>
Superior Products International chose three of these ceramic compounds to develop its insulation coating called SUPER THERM ®. A fourth ceramic was added in 2000 as part of our continued research in controlling heat transfer. This is a thin film coating that will protect against heat migration equal to six inches of fiberglass batt insulation when applied over surfaces facing the heat source. SUNSHIELD ® is inferior to SUPER THERM ® but is still superior to any of the cheap imitations on the market. SUNSHIELD ® is less expensive because the Fire ceramic \ resistance and urethane \ toughness have been left out. SUNSHIELD 2000 ® does have the same dual acrylics and similar multi ceramic insulation package. EPOXOTHERM® likewise has a similar multi ceramic insulation package but in an Epoxy carrier. Epoxies are required for application to wet substrates such as in the case of extreme condensation.<br>
<br>
Eight of the ceramic compounds were also chosen to work in combination with one another in high heat situations. HOT PIPE COATING ® ( up to 900° F \ 482° C ) and HOT SURFACE COATING ® (from 65° C - 177° C / 150° F - 350° F ) were developed to capture surface heat and stop thermal transfer via conduction. OMEGA FIRE ® will glaze and harden to stop flame, smoke or gas penetration and has a 3 hour Fire Resistance Rating. As with all of our protective coatings, each one is specifically engineered to solve a particular problem under a wide variety of application requirements and conditions.<br>

              <h4>
                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              Heavy Industry:<br>
In the US, Hoechst-Celanese Chemical Plant in Houston, Texas had been having problems with keeping their hazardous waste incinerators ( operating @ 1600F ) on-line due to the heat and dripping unburned acids ( during the cooling on shut down ). The combination of heat, condensation and unburned acids caused the bottom of the incinerator to totally corrode, forcing complete replacement approximately every 4-6 months. Costs exceeded $.25 million USD per shut down for repairs and lost production which occurred twice per year. The engineer decided to try using our RUSTGRIP primer and then SUPERTHERM as the top coat at 30 mils DFT to protect the skin of the incinerator from the heat and effects of the condensation and acid. They were applied in February 1992, and to this date, has not required downtime due to corrosion of the skin. During this time period, approximately $6 million USD has been saved in downtime alone by using the designed protective coating system. SUPER THERM was tested and approved by Ontario Hydro in Ontario, Canada as the most effective insulator available for their tanks, pipes and buildings. Infrared video was filmed showing the effectiveness of SUPERTHERM&#39;s insulation ability over fiberglass, polyester foam, white paint and other types of conventional insulation by visually demonstrating the escape of heat for the protected surface. SUPER THERM outperformed all other insulation materials. The blast furnace door at the GVRD waste incinerator was coated with 28 mils DFT of SUPERTHERM to bring the surface temperature down from 150C to 70C to meet Canadian codes for any surface exposed to human contact. After coating but before full cure a check was made with the computerized control room and the operator immediately cut back the jets due to the increased heat retention again paying for itself in reduced energy consumption.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Transportation Industry:<br>
SUPERTHERM is being applied in numerous areas in the Transportation Industry. It is reducing the fuel consumption on Reefer units by 30%. It is being applied to all the UPS trucks. It is specified by Vancouver Shipyards on all new construction to control condensation such as all the passageways on the new Kootenay Lake Ferry. It is applied to the interior of yachts for acoustical insulation as well as to increase comfort. It was also applied to the exterior superstructure of an oil tanker for thermal control.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Recreational Facilities:<br>
As reported in Rink Magazine SUPER THERM is substantially reducing utility costs on various arenas. As stated by director Dwayne Lowdermilk, National Training Rinks ( pre-engineered stress skin metal structure ) experienced a &quot; 30% reduction in utility costs, which we sure appreciate &quot;.<br>
<br>
As noted by Kirk Fisher, P. Eng. , MBA, and the Development Manager for the Lark Group, the application of $30,000 of bulk insulation ( foam ) at the Excellent Ice facility ( pre-engineered stress skin metal structure ) located in Kirland, PQ and &quot; the gas and hydro bill didn&#39;t change at all &quot;. The SUPERTHERM was doing all the work and consequently it is specified on the Surrey, BC expansion and all other ice arena developments.<br>
<br>
On the Alberni Valley Multiplex ( tilt up concrete ) a system of SUNSHIELD 2000 and SUPER THERM was applied. In May 2002 the first year audit was completed on this facility and of special interest was the fact that the cycles on the compressors were far below expectations thus resulting in major energy savings as well as longer life for the equipment itself !<br>
<br>
At the Bonaire Golf Club the application of SUPERTHERM &quot; saved the purchase of another air conditioner plus all it&#39;s related energy and maintenance costs, plus we are using the existing two units less and our building is more comfortable. Your product will help Ontario&#39;s energy problem. &quot;
           

        
                
    

    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                International capital projects:
              </h4>
         
              Manufacturing Facilities:<br>
To date more than 5 million square feet of roofing has been protected in Japan alone using SUPER THERM for such companies as Canon, Hitachi, Kirin Brewery, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Sony, Sumitomo, to name a few. Sony Engineering group conducted field studies at the Koda factory and determined that the kW usage was reduced from 3,764 kW in May 1994 to 519 kW in May 1995 a reduction of 3,248 kW or 86%. The kW usage in June 1994 was 5,647 kW which was reduced to 1,869 kW in June 1995 which was a reduction of 3,778 kW. This resulted in a payback of 13 months. As a consequence SUPER THERM was specified on their new 700,000 square foot facility in Malaysia.<br>
<br>
SUPERTHERM was applied on a manufacturing facility in Kansas that was experiencing a great deal of difficulty in cooling various unconditioned buildings of the factory due to variance in size and significant volume. The results were an immediate reduction by 12 degrees Fahrenheit on the lower levels, with an even greater reduction to the attic storage and overhead work zones on the second story. This temperature reduction enabled the facility to utilize simple ceiling fans for cooling during the summer months, and thereby lowering the overall expense of energy.
