                            Advanced Image Analysis Through Automated Anatomical Segmentation Healthcare professionals oftentimes need to uniquely identify certain anatomical structures in order to view and measure underlying anatomy. When working with digital images, selection and segmentation is normally performed using drawing tools to manually trace the contours of a specific region of interest, which can then be hidden or displayed depending on a user&#39;s preference. Manual segmentation presents a number of workflow roadblocks: *tracing the individual contours of an anatomical region can be a time consuming process and are largely dependent on subjective judgment<br>
*manual segmentation can produce different results from different physicians (consequently leading to different diagnoses).<br>
<br>
Revolutionizing the way that clinical specialists manipulate medical images, Cedara Software&#39;s image segmentation technologies provide fast, efficient and consistent means for separating anatomical structures.<br>

                            Advanced Imaging through Dual Modalities PET and PET/CT are popular topics of discussion in both nuclear medicine and radiology forums. From imaging previously unknown neurological processes to its impact on oncology, these modalities are causing a stir amongst medical imaging professionals.<br>
<br>
As a combined modality PET/CT provides powerful functionality beyond the scope of either PET or CT images alone, by allowing healthcare specialists to view physiological activity in conjunction with anatomical location. As a relatively new modality, many radiology systems and PACS solutions however, are struggling to adapt to this technology. Sadly, many remain totally incompatible, forcing reading physicians to practice on the PET/CT console itself.<br>
<br>
Addressing many of the issues surrounding the synthesis of data from PET/CT, Cedara is pleased to provide a software solution which allows PACS integration, while improving workflow, connectivity and efficiencies surrounding this modality. Cedaras PET/CT Workstation breaks away from historic methods of showing PET/CT images by providing layouts split across dual monitors in panoramic mode.<br>
<br>
Integrated Workflow for PET/CT Reporting While some vendors try to make PET/CT seem complicated and overly technical, Cedara Software&#39;s PET/CT Workstation has been designed to easily accommodate the standard methods that Radiologists use to read CT datasets. <br>
<br>
Following the norm found in PACS, Cedaras PET/CT Workstation breaks away from historic methods of showing PET/CT images by providing layouts split across dual monitors in panoramic mode. For efficient study comparison, this method of review allows simultaneous comparison of CT images, PET Corrected, PET Uncorrected, PET/CT Fused Images and MIP among others. Rigid Registration between images allows simultaneous navigation through all datasets.<br>
<br>
Fast and Efficient Workflow Cedaras PET/CT Workstation employs a variety of features designed to streamline the reporting of PET/CT studies:<br>
<br>
*Progressive Reformatting to significantly improve time-to-first-image, allowing physicians to begin reporting while studies continue to load <br>
*Support for dual monitors with special panoramic layouts <br>
*3D Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), Minimum Intensity *Projection (mIP) and 3D as hot-spot scout <br>
*Tools for reading from axial, sagittal and coronal slices <br>
*Quickly compare current and prior images simultaneously <br>
<br>
Image Registration Cedaras PET/CT Workstation provides two methods for linking images together (rigid transformation):<br>
<br>
*Manual Alignment (user interactively defines orientation, scaling and translation in each study for registration) <br>
*Landmark Alignment (user selects matching anatomical references in each study for registration) <br>
<br>
Through Image Registration, Cedaras PET/CT Workstation provides cross-correlation (or triangulation) between all images. Whether in 2D, 3D or MPR views, clicking on a region automatically snaps all views to the same location. <br>
<br>
Comprehensive Tools to Report PET/CT For practitioners familiar with PACS systems, Cedara PET/CT Workstation contains immediately recognizable controls. Tools include:<br>
<br>
*Measurements -&gt; line, angle, rectangle, ellipse, polyline, polygon (including SUV calculation) <br>
*SUV modes -&gt; Body weight, Body surface area &amp; Lean body mass <br>
*Standard tools for zoom, pan, magnify, 3D rotation, adjust fusion control, window/level presets, reset <br>
*Configurable colourmaps for PET &amp; MIP display <br>
<br>
Integration PET/CT can be easily integrated into PACS environments through DICOM capabilities including:<br>
<br>
*Output via DICOM Secondary Capture <br>
*Launch via DICOM Part 10 files <br>
*Hardcopy via DICOM Print <br>
*Mark as Read <br>
<br>
Cedaras PET/CT Workstation has been designed to operate with all PET or PET/CT manufacturers equipment, and allows mulitmodality review from one workstation.<br>
<br>
For OEM companies, Cedara PET/CT Workstation is available as a standalone workstation or can be tightly integrated into existing PACS solutions using Cedara&#39;s unique C4 integration platform.<br>

Universal Image Access Softcopy reporting should mean that images are available where, when and how you need them. Beyond the needs of radiological reporting, a Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) should provide image access to referring physicians, clinicians and other healthcare specialists. Dedicated workstations, while robust in functionality, present some limitations in terms of image access.<br>
<br>
Beyond image needs within your institution, PACS solutions also need to accommodate the needs of teleradiology; they should provide a solution for oncall Radiologists, who would like to review images from offsite locations; they should allow physicians at multi-site facilities to view patient images during rounds.<br>
<br>
For environments where immediate image access can make the difference between life and death, your PACS solution needs to extend the reach of Medical Imaging throughout your institution and beyond.<br>

                            Screening Coronary Artery Disease Coronary disease represents a growing concern for people around the world. For many patients, the first sign of Coronary Artery Disease can be a heart attack. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, approximately 13 million people in the United States have coronary artery disease (CAD). It is the leading cause of death in both men and women in this country. Today, in an effort to detect CAD as early as possible, many healthcare professionals are turning to tests such as Calcium Scoring. Performed using a CT Scanner, calcium scoring provides an excellent means for physicians to visualize plaque build-up in coronary arteries, and calculate a Calcium Score to predict risk of clinical coronary artery disease. <br>
<br>
Cedaras CalScore software is a leading edge solution for radiologists, cardiologists and other specialists working in the field of cardiac screening. Including a wide selection of easy-to-use, yet powerful diagnostic tools, CalScore is a solution designed by Cardiovascular Specialists for Cardiovascular Specialists. Depending on your needs, CalScore can be fully integrated into PACS reporting workstations. <br>
<br>
Calcium Scoring for Cardiovascular Specialists To directly address the needs of Cardiovascular Specialists, CalScore was developed in cooperation with Dr. John Rumberger, a Clinical Professor of Medicine [Cardiology] at the Ohio State University and a former Chairman of the American Heart Association Committee on Cardiovascular Radiology. Using advanced technology, it supports lesion-by- lesion and side-by-side comparison for follow-up or repeat scanning.<br>
<br>

<br>
*Score arterial segments, as well as complete arteries <br>
*Aortic Scoring <br>
*Exclusive use of Dr. John Rumberger&#39;s Mass-based database <br>
*Compare prior against current patient calcium scores <br>
*Quickly generate reports in MS Word format <br>
*Agatston, Volume, and Mass-based methods of calcium scoring. <br>
*Allows Clinics to track current referral base <br>
*DICOM Connectivity <br>

*Exclusive use of Dr. Rumbergers Mass-based database <br>
*Calcium Scoring &amp; Risk Stratification based on Agatston, Volume or Mass <br>
<br>
Extensive Decision Tree Using customized report templates, CalScore includes a variety of recommendations for treatment based on total plaque burden. Recommendations can be reviewed and/or revised by reading cardiologists or radiologists prior to publishing. In total, there are 10 sets of recommendations based on the following criteria:<br>
<br>
*Symptomatic or asymptomatic <br>
*Total calcium score <br>
*Presence or absence of aortic calcification <br>
<br>
Some of CalScores sample recommendations include:<br>
<br>
*The CT examination has shown a high and rather extensive measurable coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden. <br>
*Areas of mild non-obstructive coronary narrowing are very likely to be present, and based on observational studies there is at least a 50% chance that there is a low limiting stenosis. <br>
*The patients body mass index (BMI) is 28.4. A BMI &gt;25 and &lt;30 is classified as overweight. This is a modifiable risk factor and modest weight loss is suggested and can be achieved via a combination of diet and regular exercise. <br>
<br>
Comprehensive Report Generation Following examination and diagnosis, Cedara CalScore automatically generates a report based on the following criteria:<br>
<br>
*Calcium score percentile information based on age and gender <br>
*Framingham risk factor adjusted for coronary calcium &quot;age <br>
*ACE/AII intake (if presence and/or history of hypertension) <br>
*Non-invasive index (classification of symptomatic patients) <br>
*Presence or absence of hypertension (and/or history of) <br>
*Bone mineral density risk factor, obtained from any OEM BMD package (purchased separately) <br>
*Daily aspirin and antioxidant intake <br>
*Cholesterol levels and medication <br>
*Presence or absence of diabetes <br>
*Evolution of total calcium volume <br>
*Previous total calcium score <br>
*Current or former smoker <br>
*First or follow-up study <br>
*Aortic calcification <br>

                            A Better Way to Review Multi-disciplinary Conferences Cedara I-Conference is a hospital image presentation application specifically adapted to multi-disciplinary conferences and the clinical presentation of images and image related information.<br>
<br>
Multi-disciplinary conferences between cardiologists, radiologists, surgeons, and referring physicians require concise presentations of clinical data and images which is a tedious and time-consuming process that requires significant time. With Cedara I-Conference preparation time is drastically reduced because images and image related information from various media can be pre-selected and easily combined to produce an optimized clinical presentation. This allows the presenter to focus solely on the conference proceeding rather than on the equipment or the image selection.<br>
<br>
Cedara I-Conference provides physicians with a tailored presentation that allows pre-selected images from all imaging modalities and non-DICOM standard documents, including QuickTime and Adobe to be easily tagged and edited. This gives physicians the same productivity in medicine that Microsoft® PowerPoint has brought to business. Support is provided for various formats including DICOM, AVI, DOC, XLS, PPT and PDF for presentation of images, loops, reports, and waveforms (EKGs).<br>
<br>
Presentation Creation<br>
*Easy authoring mode <br>
*Authoring by multiple users <br>
*Easy to use DICOM viewer that uses simple tools <br>
*Configurable DICOM nodes <br>

                            Preventing Colon Cancer Colon cancer is the third most frequently occurring cancer in the United States and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Each year, 65,000 people in the United States die from this disease, while over 150,000 new cases are diagnosed. <br>
<br>
Similar to other forms of cancer, early detection of colon cancer has been proven to dramatically improve survival rates. Despite recommendations by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and other organizations, the majority of the population avoids traditional, optical colorectal screening due to the invasive, unpleasant nature of the procedure. Because of this, authorities estimate only 20% of the group at risk are actually screened each year. CT Colonography or Virtual Colonoscopy presents an increasingly popular alternative for those unwilling or unable to undergo optical colonoscopy. <br>
<br>
Recognizing the need for new solutions in this area, Cedara Software is pleased to introduce Cedara IlumiView, a robust application for the seamless review, analysis and reporting of CT colonography.<br>
<br>
A Flexible Screening Tool for Different Healthcare Facilities Cedara IlumiView provides an intuitive workflow that allows specialists to easily transition to offering virtual colonoscopy in place of conventional optical techniques whenever necessary. For PACS companies, modality manufacturers and other healthcare vendors interested in expanding their product offerings, IlumiView provides an excellent means to support CT colon screening programs.<br>
<br>
Highlights of the application include:<br>
*PACS connectivity as a standalone workstation or as an integrated capability for existing systems, etc. <br>
*Navigate in 2D or volume rendered view of the lumen <br>
*Easy 3D investigation of suspect polyps <br>
*Automatic report generation <br>
I<br>
lumiView is a complete workflow solution that provides powerful tools to review colon studies and report their findings. It enhances productivity by integrating software tools to visualize the lumen, record findings, and automatically generate a report.

                            Early Detection of Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in both men and women in the United States, killing more people than cancers of the breast, colon, cervix and prostate combined. While survival rates have been climbing for other forms of cancer, the survival rates for lung cancer have remained dismal with one of the worst prognoses of all cancers. <br>
<br>
Lung cancer does not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage, when treatment is least likely to work. Studies have indicated however that early Stage 1 Lung Cancer discovered through new screening techniques has a cure rate of 70% and sometimes even higher. A recent International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I- ELCAP) study published in October 2006 stated that lung cancer can be detected at its very earliest stage in 85 percent of patients using annual low-dose CT screening, and when followed by prompt surgical removal the 10-year survival rate is 92 percent. <br>
<br>
Beyond these statistics, lung nodule analysis and follow up is one of the most challenging tasks confronting today&#39;s radiologists. The problems of dealing with hundreds of slices and the small differentiation between healthy anatomy and diseased structures contribute to make this an attention-intensive task. <br>
<br>
Cedara recognizes that productivity can be enhanced by judicious software tools that aid physicians while still providing complete authority over the output.<br>
<br>

                            Cedara can build specific teams to meet a clients needs, combining business analysis, subject matter expertise, seasoned developers, QA and management staff. The team will be highly focused on delivering a project, or product, for the client and for the duration of the work will be dedicated to that client.<br>
<br>
The project team will spend some proportion of their activity in project infrastructure tasks: there will be efforts associated with project setup and staff orientation to get the project aligned to a clients needs; depending on the extent of hardware interfacing or the need for lab setup there could be a variable infrastructure setup tasks. Overall, the efficiency of the group in rolling-out a deliverable will be lessened by the infrastructure tasks<br>

                            A more effective alternative to project-based engineering is to hire a dedicated team over a longer term. This delivers great efficiencies in infrastructure setup and in leveraging the know-how and experience built up in the development group  assets that appreciate over the long-term.<br>
<br>
Projects can be delivered faster or with greater functionality and feature sets.<br>
<br>
Cedara can offer the lowest onshore and offshore rates with fixed and predictable monthly billings, and will handle all the intricacies of running an offshore operation.<br>
<br>
Larger scale development, multiple products and multiple product cycles can be handled effectively with Capacity Engineering. The dedicated teams can be adjusted for engineering maintenance and re-engineering.<br>
<br>
Cedara provides an organization to the customer giving managerial and executive access so an OEM has control of the project or program. Similarly, an OEM should dedicate staff to the project and identify complementary management and executive structures. <br>
<br>
The teams are structured with higher-level peer communication to the executive level. Since multiple projects may be on-going under Capacity Engineering, director-level relationships manage oversea combined activities with multiple project managers liaising at the project level. <br>

                            Advanced Image Analysis Through Automated Anatomical Segmentation Healthcare professionals oftentimes need to uniquely identify certain anatomical structures in order to view and measure underlying anatomy. When working with digital images, selection and segmentation is normally performed using drawing tools to manually trace the contours of a specific region of interest, which can then be hidden or displayed depending on a user&#39;s preference. Manual segmentation presents a number of workflow roadblocks: *tracing the individual contours of an anatomical region can be a time consuming process and are largely dependent on subjective judgment<br>
*manual segmentation can produce different results from different physicians (consequently leading to different diagnoses).<br>

                            Advanced Imaging through Dual Modalities PET and PET/CT are popular topics of discussion in both nuclear medicine and radiology forums. From imaging previously unknown neurological processes to its impact on oncology, these modalities are causing a stir amongst medical imaging professionals.<br>
<br>
As a combined modality PET/CT provides powerful functionality beyond the scope of either PET or CT images alone, by allowing healthcare specialists to view physiological activity in conjunction with anatomical location. As a relatively new modality, many radiology systems and PACS solutions however, are struggling to adapt to this technology. Sadly, many remain totally incompatible, forcing reading physicians to practice on the PET/CT console itself.<br>
<br>
Addressing many of the issues surrounding the synthesis of data from PET/CT, Cedara is pleased to provide a software solution which allows PACS integration, while improving workflow, connectivity and efficiencies surrounding this modality. Cedaras PET/CT Workstation breaks away from historic methods of showing PET/CT images by providing layouts split across dual monitors in panoramic mode.<br>
<br>
Integrated Workflow for PET/CT Reporting While some vendors try to make PET/CT seem complicated and overly technical, Cedara Software&#39;s PET/CT Workstation has been designed to easily accommodate the standard methods that Radiologists use to read CT datasets. <br>
<br>
Following the norm found in PACS, Cedaras PET/CT Workstation breaks away from historic methods of showing PET/CT images by providing layouts split across dual monitors in panoramic mode. For efficient study comparison, this method of review allows simultaneous comparison of CT images, PET Corrected, PET Uncorrected, PET/CT Fused Images and MIP among others. Rigid Registration between images allows simultaneous navigation through all datasets.<br>
<br>
Fast and Efficient Workflow Cedaras PET/CT Workstation employs a variety of features designed to streamline the reporting of PET/CT studies:<br>
<br>
*Progressive Reformatting to significantly improve time-to-first-image, allowing physicians to begin reporting while studies continue to load <br>
*Support for dual monitors with special panoramic layouts <br>
*3D Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), Minimum Intensity *Projection (mIP) and 3D as hot-spot scout <br>
*Tools for reading from axial, sagittal and coronal slices <br>
*Quickly compare current and prior images simultaneously <br>
<br>
Image Registration Cedaras PET/CT Workstation provides two methods for linking images together (rigid transformation):<br>
<br>
*Manual Alignment (user interactively defines orientation, scaling and translation in each study for registration) <br>
*Landmark Alignment (user selects matching anatomical references in each study for registration) <br>
<br>
Through Image Registration, Cedaras PET/CT Workstation provides cross-correlation (or triangulation) between all images. Whether in 2D, 3D or MPR views, clicking on a region automatically snaps all views to the same location. <br>
<br>
Comprehensive Tools to Report PET/CT For practitioners familiar with PACS systems, Cedara PET/CT Workstation contains immediately recognizable controls. Tools include:<br>
<br>
*Measurements -&gt; line, angle, rectangle, ellipse, polyline, polygon (including SUV calculation) <br>
*SUV modes -&gt; Body weight, Body surface area &amp; Lean body mass <br>
*Standard tools for zoom, pan, magnify, 3D rotation, adjust fusion control, window/level presets, reset <br>
*Configurable colourmaps for PET &amp; MIP display <br>
<br>
Integration PET/CT can be easily integrated into PACS environments through DICOM capabilities including:<br>
<br>
*Output via DICOM Secondary Capture <br>
*Launch via DICOM Part 10 files <br>
*Hardcopy via DICOM Print <br>
*Mark as Read <br>
<br>
Cedaras PET/CT Workstation has been designed to operate with all PET or PET/CT manufacturers equipment, and allows mulitmodality review from one workstation.<br>
<br>
For OEM companies, Cedara PET/CT Workstation is available as a standalone workstation or can be tightly integrated into existing PACS solutions using Cedara&#39;s unique C4 integration platform.<br>

Universal Image Access Softcopy reporting should mean that images are available where, when and how you need them. Beyond the needs of radiological reporting, a Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) should provide image access to referring physicians, clinicians and other healthcare specialists. Dedicated workstations, while robust in functionality, present some limitations in terms of image access.<br>
<br>
Beyond image needs within your institution, PACS solutions also need to accommodate the needs of teleradiology; they should provide a solution for oncall Radiologists, who would like to review images from offsite locations; they should allow physicians at multi-site facilities to view patient images during rounds.<br>
<br>
For environments where immediate image access can make the difference between life and death, your PACS solution needs to extend the reach of Medical Imaging throughout your institution and beyond.<br>

                            Screening Coronary Artery Disease Coronary disease represents a growing concern for people around the world. For many patients, the first sign of Coronary Artery Disease can be a heart attack. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, approximately 13 million people in the United States have coronary artery disease (CAD). It is the leading cause of death in both men and women in this country. Today, in an effort to detect CAD as early as possible, many healthcare professionals are turning to tests such as Calcium Scoring. Performed using a CT Scanner, calcium scoring provides an excellent means for physicians to visualize plaque build-up in coronary arteries, and calculate a Calcium Score to predict risk of clinical coronary artery disease. <br>
<br>
Cedaras CalScore software is a leading edge solution for radiologists, cardiologists and other specialists working in the field of cardiac screening. Including a wide selection of easy-to-use, yet powerful diagnostic tools, CalScore is a solution designed by Cardiovascular Specialists for Cardiovascular Specialists. Depending on your needs, CalScore can be fully integrated into PACS reporting workstations. <br>
<br>
Calcium Scoring for Cardiovascular Specialists To directly address the needs of Cardiovascular Specialists, CalScore was developed in cooperation with Dr. John Rumberger, a Clinical Professor of Medicine [Cardiology] at the Ohio State University and a former Chairman of the American Heart Association Committee on Cardiovascular Radiology. Using advanced technology, it supports lesion-by- lesion and side-by-side comparison for follow-up or repeat scanning.<br>
<br>
Key Functionality:<br>
<br>
*Score arterial segments, as well as complete arteries <br>
*Aortic Scoring <br>
*Exclusive use of Dr. John Rumberger&#39;s Mass-based database <br>
*Compare prior against current patient calcium scores <br>
*Quickly generate reports in MS Word format <br>
*Agatston, Volume, and Mass-based methods of calcium scoring. <br>
*Allows Clinics to track current referral base <br>

*Exclusive use of Dr. Rumbergers Mass-based database <br>
*Calcium Scoring &amp; Risk Stratification based on Agatston, Volume or Mass <br>
<br>
Extensive Decision Tree Using customized report templates, CalScore includes a variety of recommendations for treatment based on total plaque burden. Recommendations can be reviewed and/or revised by reading cardiologists or radiologists prior to publishing. In total, there are 10 sets of recommendations based on the following criteria:<br>
<br>
*Symptomatic or asymptomatic <br>
*Total calcium score <br>
*Presence or absence of aortic calcification <br>
<br>
Some of CalScores sample recommendations include:<br>
<br>
*The CT examination has shown a high and rather extensive measurable coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden. <br>
*Areas of mild non-obstructive coronary narrowing are very likely to be present, and based on observational studies there is at least a 50% chance that there is a low limiting stenosis. <br>
*The patients body mass index (BMI) is 28.4. A BMI &gt;25 and &lt;30 is classified as overweight. This is a modifiable risk factor and modest weight loss is suggested and can be achieved via a combination of diet and regular exercise. <br>
<br>
Comprehensive Report Generation Following examination and diagnosis, Cedara CalScore automatically generates a report based on the following criteria:<br>
<br>
*Calcium score percentile information based on age and gender <br>
*Framingham risk factor adjusted for coronary calcium &quot;age <br>
*ACE/AII intake (if presence and/or history of hypertension) <br>
*Non-invasive index (classification of symptomatic patients) <br>
*Presence or absence of hypertension (and/or history of) <br>
*Bone mineral density risk factor, obtained from any OEM BMD package (purchased separately) <br>
*Daily aspirin and antioxidant intake <br>
*Cholesterol levels and medication <br>
*Presence or absence of diabetes <br>
*Evolution of total calcium volume <br>
*Previous total calcium score <br>
*Current or former smoker <br>
*First or follow-up study <br>
*Aortic calcification <br>
*Body Mass Index <br>
*Exercise level <br>
*Family history <br>
<br>

                            A Better Way to Review Multi-disciplinary Conferences Cedara I-Conference is a hospital image presentation application specifically adapted to multi-disciplinary conferences and the clinical presentation of images and image related information.<br>
<br>
Multi-disciplinary conferences between cardiologists, radiologists, surgeons, and referring physicians require concise presentations of clinical data and images which is a tedious and time-consuming process that requires significant time. With Cedara I-Conference preparation time is drastically reduced because images and image related information from various media can be pre-selected and easily combined to produce an optimized clinical presentation. This allows the presenter to focus solely on the conference proceeding rather than on the equipment or the image selection.<br>
<br>
Cedara I-Conference provides physicians with a tailored presentation that allows pre-selected images from all imaging modalities and non-DICOM standard documents, including QuickTime and Adobe to be easily tagged and edited. This gives physicians the same productivity in medicine that Microsoft® PowerPoint has brought to business. Support is provided for various formats including DICOM, AVI, DOC, XLS, PPT and PDF for presentation of images, loops, reports, and waveforms (EKGs).<br>

                            Preventing Colon Cancer Colon cancer is the third most frequently occurring cancer in the United States and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Each year, 65,000 people in the United States die from this disease, while over 150,000 new cases are diagnosed. <br>
<br>
Similar to other forms of cancer, early detection of colon cancer has been proven to dramatically improve survival rates. Despite recommendations by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and other organizations, the majority of the population avoids traditional, optical colorectal screening due to the invasive, unpleasant nature of the procedure. Because of this, authorities estimate only 20% of the group at risk are actually screened each year. CT Colonography or Virtual Colonoscopy presents an increasingly popular alternative for those unwilling or unable to undergo optical colonoscopy. <br>
<br>
Recognizing the need for new solutions in this area, Cedara Software is pleased to introduce Cedara IlumiView, a robust application for the seamless review, analysis and reporting of CT colonography.<br>
<br>
A Flexible Screening Tool for Different Healthcare Facilities Cedara IlumiView provides an intuitive workflow that allows specialists to easily transition to offering virtual colonoscopy in place of conventional optical techniques whenever necessary. For PACS companies, modality manufacturers and other healthcare vendors interested in expanding their product offerings, IlumiView provides an excellent means to support CT colon screening programs.<br>
<br>
Highlights of the application include:<br>
*PACS connectivity as a standalone workstation or as an integrated capability for existing systems, etc. <br>

                            Early Detection of Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in both men and women in the United States, killing more people than cancers of the breast, colon, cervix and prostate combined. While survival rates have been climbing for other forms of cancer, the survival rates for lung cancer have remained dismal with one of the worst prognoses of all cancers. <br>
<br>
Lung cancer does not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage, when treatment is least likely to work. Studies have indicated however that early Stage 1 Lung Cancer discovered through new screening techniques has a cure rate of 70% and sometimes even higher. A recent International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I- ELCAP) study published in October 2006 stated that lung cancer can be detected at its very earliest stage in 85 percent of patients using annual low-dose CT screening, and when followed by prompt surgical removal the 10-year survival rate is 92 percent. <br>
<br>
Beyond these statistics, lung nodule analysis and follow up is one of the most challenging tasks confronting today&#39;s radiologists. The problems of dealing with hundreds of slices and the small differentiation between healthy anatomy and diseased structures contribute to make this an attention-intensive task. <br>
<br>
Cedara recognizes that productivity can be enhanced by judicious software tools that aid physicians while still providing complete authority over the output.<br>
<br>
A Flexible Screening Tool for Different Healthcare Facilities Cedara PrimeLung provides a flexible workflow that allows specialists familiar with traditional x-ray lung screening to easily make the transition to a CT lung review program. For PACS companies, modality manufacturers and other healthcare vendors interested in expanding their product offerings, PrimeLung provides an excellent means to support diagnostic analysis of the lungs and CT lung screening programs.

                            eFilm Vet is a current development project at Cedara Software, combining the power of eFilm Workstation with dedicated functionality for animal imaging. Included in this unique version of eFilm, will be support for the tenets of DICOM group 25, allowing veterinarian radiologists to view DICOM tags such as species, breed and other relevant animal information. <br>
<br>
The Most Widely Used Diagnostic Workstation in the World eFilm Workstation 2.1 is the newest release of the widely-used desktop diagnostic imaging software. eFilm Workstation incorporates many features required for day-to-day work, window/level presets, synchronized stacking, MPR, reference lines, cine function and integrated CD burning, as well as advanced capabilities like volume rendering. eFilm Workstation continues to utilize customer feedback and the leading imaging trends to bring you high level workflow, visualization, processing and CD burning capabilities in an intuitive, economical manner.<br>
<br>
Enhanced Workflow for Clinical Reading eFilm Workstation 2.1 contains many tools which help you quickly load, review and save images as efficiently as possible, providing you valuable time savings in your radiology workflow. Designed to accelerate productivity, it allows you to examine multiple studies simultaneously, cross-reference, measure, rotate, pan, zoom, and annotate in an all-in-one application. Additional features include:<br>
<br>
Split a Series For a Series with images that overlap (e.g. a multi-phase CT abdomen) eFilm can split the series into the appropriate number of sub-series (based on where they overlap in the patient), and the new sub-series that are created can be viewed independently. The new subseries can also be synchronized using the manual or auto synchronization features. <br>
Automatic Timed User Interface Locking hides and locks the eFilm user interface after a settable period of inactivity on the part of the user. This allows you to leave a session safely and return with a simple login. <br>
<br>
Toolbar and mouse functionality can be fully customized on a per modality basis to ensure you have quick access to only the tools you use. <br>

                            Cedara can build specific teams to meet a clients needs, combining business analysis, subject matter expertise, seasoned developers, QA and management staff. The team will be highly focused on delivering a project, or product, for the client and for the duration of the work will be dedicated to that client.<br>
<br>
The project team will spend some proportion of their activity in project infrastructure tasks: there will be efforts associated with project setup and staff orientation to get the project aligned to a clients needs; depending on the extent of hardware interfacing or the need for lab setup there could be a variable infrastructure setup tasks. Overall, the efficiency of the group in rolling-out a deliverable will be lessened by the infrastructure tasks<br>

                            A more effective alternative to project-based engineering is to hire a dedicated team over a longer term. This delivers great efficiencies in infrastructure setup and in leveraging the know-how and experience built up in the development group  assets that appreciate over the long-term.<br>
<br>
Projects can be delivered faster or with greater functionality and feature sets.<br>
<br>
Cedara can offer the lowest onshore and offshore rates with fixed and predictable monthly billings, and will handle all the intricacies of running an offshore operation.<br>
<br>
Larger scale development, multiple products and multiple product cycles can be handled effectively with Capacity Engineering. The dedicated teams can be adjusted for engineering maintenance and re-engineering.<br>
<br>
Cedara provides an organization to the customer giving managerial and executive access so an OEM has control of the project or program. Similarly, an OEM should dedicate staff to the project and identify complementary management and executive structures. <br>
<br>
The teams are structured with higher-level peer communication to the executive level. Since multiple projects may be on-going under Capacity Engineering, director-level relationships manage oversea combined activities with multiple project managers liaising at the project level. <br>
