                            I recognize the courage you are showing by exploring options for support. I am interested in the journey that has taken you to this moment and I will provide a non-judgmental and collaborative space to explore your story, your feelings, your barriers, and your hopes for the future. I believe that we are all vulnerable to finding ourselves stuck in patterns that dont serve us well. I also believe in every persons ability to get unstuck and lead a fulfilling life and to maintain relationships that are meaningful, trusting, and fulfilling. <br>

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (also known as CBT) is a short-term and goal oriented treatment that takes a hands-on, practical approach to solving problems. CBT is short-term; addressing a wide spectrum of issues in a persons life, from sleeping difficulties, health concerns and relationship issues, to anxiety, depression and addictions. CBT offers techniques and strategies that can be incorporated into your daily living. CBT is highly adaptive, it is structured, it is cross-cultural, and focuses on thoughts, feelings, behaviors and belief systems. It deals with both the underlying issues in conjunction with behavioral issues. It is highly effective. Megan uses CBT and various interventions, therapies and skills gained through training, education and experience to help you find the answers to your concerns within yourself.<br>

                            Grief and Loss are natural reactions to the death of a loved one, or any major life change like an illness, a career change, divorce, betrayal, or severed relationships. Grief can trigger acute physical and emotional anguish and overwhelm us. If left untreated, this suffering may go on for months or years; for some decades. Grief and Loss Counselling is designed to help individuals move through all the stages of the grieving process, and not get stuck or remain stuck in the process. Counselling helps resolve anger, helplessness, hopelessness, depression, sadness, fears and anxietywhatever you are dealing with. Grieving produces very powerful feelings, and for some shutting off those feelings is the coping mechanism that may work for a time, but will keep resurfacing until those powerful feelings are dealt with. Sometimes lifes responsibilities can distract us from facing our grief and dealing with it; until we feel numb inside or wondering if life is worth living. Working through your loss in Grief Counselling sessions, whatever your loss, can prevent the negative physical, emotional and social side effects that come from ignoring the emotions after any painful loss. The process is different for everyonesome try to work through it on their own but find that it resurfaces through depression, anxiety, fears, loneliness, physical illness. Counselling therapy is not a quick fix for grief.your own unique process cannot be rushed. With help you will discover the stages of grief/grieving, where you are in your grieving process, and in the process find out so much about yourself.<br>

                            Anger is a normal, usually healthy emotion. Anger is not a behavior. Anger is intended to protect us from harm, help us get our needs met, and to keep us from falling into despair. Managed correctly or kept in check, anger is a healthy ally in our lives. Conversely, stuffing feelings down, pretending you have dealt with them, or finally exploding or getting loaded; these are not healthy ways of dealing with anger. Sometimes depression is anger turned inwards. When anger fuels aggressive or destructive behaviours, it is definitely problematic and can lead to legal issues. Anger, the behavior, can alienate us from people, it can be destructive in our significant relationships, and can push us further into isolation, loneliness and despair. It can fuel guilt, shame, remorse and inferiority. Anger, the behavior, can lead us to do things we will regret. Anger can be fueled by past events, maybe from our childhood that is playing out in a current triggering situation. Anger can be a sign that a deeper underlying mental health issue is present. Anger is a serious problem when abuse, aggression and/or violence are present. Drug and alcohol may mask issues of anger temporarily; but drugs and alcohol use may make anger worse. If you find yourself tense, frustrated, simmering just below the surface, arguing with people often, people dont want to be around or they disappoint you, and it is possible you or a loved one has problems with the feeling and the behavior. Anger control is difficult for many people. Anger can be abusive to self and others. Anger can turn into rage. With help, the client who struggles with anger issues can uncover what lies at the root of their frustration or rage. The client can identify their triggers and learn healthy coping or avoidant strategies and skills. They also learn what their relapse cycle is and learn to abort the relapsing behavior before it spirals out of control.<br>

                            A healthy sense of self notably impacts how we feel and function in the world. Self-esteem is our basic sense of worth and value. Low self-esteem can mean constant self-doubt, self-criticism, and an inferior ego state, and mental health issues. Abuse, supressed anger, loneliness, isolation, depression and shame fuel low self-esteem. The lack of positive reinforcement and encouragement while growing up can have lasting scars on self-esteem. Negative core beliefs that were instilled in us growing up can keep our self-worth and esteem low. Criticism, bullying, peer pressure, abandonment and rejection also have negative impact on an individuals self-esteem, worth and value. We can develop a healthier positive self-esteem and value.<br>

                            For some people change, which are inevitable, results in rolling with the punches. However for many, change is more challenging. Lifes transitions no matter what they are can significantly impact how we interact in the world; they can knock us off balance. Change is situational while transition is psychological. Our inner reorientation and redefined meaning helps incorporate the change, or may set up resistance to the change. Some transitions are voluntary, however some are involuntary. We may feel equipped for the transitions like a move, going off to school, or becoming an empty nester, and then discover that we were not prepared for the transition component of the change. When our life path suddenly goes off the rails we can be shaken to our very core. Some life transitions leave us feeling vulnerable and uncertain about our future. Many transitions begin with some kind of ending. Sometimes in those ending, we leave unfinished business behind. When the transition is difficult, it is important to go back and explore that unfinished business, or whatever is holding us back. Often fear, anxiety, even depression get triggered, and we may find ourselves locked in and not able to move forward. We can build on transitional strengths from our past that can help us move forward into our present situation and our future.<br>

                            Codependency is a psychological condition that may have begun in childhood, surfaces as a result of physical, emotional or sexual abuse, and left untreated has a way of penetrating our everyday living. Most codependents place a lower value on themselves and their needs in relationships. Codependency appears in relationships: family, peers, work, intimate relationships, and relationship with self. Often denial, compliance, passivity, abuse, poor self-esteem, controlling, or being controlled are all signs and symptoms of codependency. Working on your codependency issues can have a significant positive impact on your life. The benefits are great to working on codependency. You can have better self-esteem, have a voice and an opinion, give up the need to control self or others, stop the abuse in your life, and any self-abuse issues. Your relationships can improve greatly and become more satisfying. You can grow in many directions.<br>

                            Healthy relationships allow both unique individuals to feel supported and connected while interacting with each other interdependently. Healthy communication and healthy boundaries are two major components that contribute to healthy relationships. Both people in the relationship decide what is healthy and what is not. If something doesnt feel right, you should be able to express and discuss this with your partner. Dealing constructively with conflict, listening and hearing each other; these skills help strengthen the relationship. Sometimes partners do not express what they really want or feel until they find themselves in therapy. Some people come to therapy to get an issue out on the table and begin dealing with it with professional support for both. Saying no when you mean no sets clear boundaries, helps define the relationship, who you are, and who the other person is. Saying yes when you mean no does not contribute to a healthy relationship. Your consent can be taken back or changed at any time, and there is no such thing as implied consent in healthy relationships. Unhealthy communication can lead to conflictand a mountain of unresolved conflict and resentments over time can destroy the relationship and create abusiveness. Whether you are struggling in a relationship, wanting to learn how to be healthier in your new relationship, or ending a relationship and wanting to work on yourself, doing relationship work is a gift you give yourself and others. Some clients come to therapy to do some deeper work on their relationship with themselves to make it healthier. Doing relationship work produces more healthy enriching relationships. Relationship work includes communication, boundaries, openness, honesty, trust, unconditional love and intimacy as integral components of the relationship with healthy boundaries and healthy communication. Abuse (perpetrated by either a female or male) is never acceptable in a relationship and help and safety should be sought immediately.<br>

                            Megan trained, completed supervised practicums, and practiced with a team in the field of Expressive Arts Therapy for 5 years. Some of her clients prefer Expressive Arts Therapy while others prefer the more traditional approaches in therapy. Expressive Arts Therapy is a longer session; 2 hours from beginning to end. Clients who want EAT, generally start off in the traditional modes of therapy, moving into and exploring certain issues using EAT. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can easily be incorporated into EAT. <br>

                            Drug addicts fall in love with the good feelings that alcohol and other drugs produce. For some addicts they fall in love with the euphoria their drug gives them. For others, it numbs feelings. And for others, they feel invincible and unconquerable. Addicts mistakenly believe that they are not harming themselves or others. The brain is significantly altered by all addictions. Addicts stop using only when the pain and heartache of using hurts so much that they have to stop using in order to survive. Addiction is cunning, baffling, powerful, and extremely patient. Relapsing (recidivism) is part of the addiction; not recovery. Whether it is abuse or dependency, there is a way out that doesnt have to lead to death. Approximately 1 in 10 individuals are addicted to drugs and alcohol in our country today. Families and loved ones are agonizingly impacted by the drug addict or alcoholics addiction and the pervasive consequences. Without help, it is impossible to stop. Help and recovery are available for everyone involved.<br>

                            Like all addictive behaviours, gambling addiction destroys lives; from finances and families, relationships and careers, to self-worth, self-esteem and sanity. Treating addictive behaviors is no different than treating addictive substances. As with all addictions, gambling may start out as a social activity, labelled harmless. The brain is significantly altered by all addictions. It is only when the compulsions spiral out of control and take over the life of the addict, does the addict begin to realize that s/he is drowning in gambling addiction with no foreseeable way out. Whether it is being hooked on the slots, sports, the horses, online poker, or casinos, etc., the loss of control is always the same along with lying, deceit and broken promises. Lying, borrowing money, stealing, being fired from your job, selling household furniture to get the fixthe trail of compulsive gambling and its highway of destruction is inescapable. The carelessness towards our family and loved ones, the potential for self-harm and self-destruction are often are the precursors to getting help and getting into recovery. Family members and loved ones are agonizingly impacted by the compulsive gamblers addiction and the pervasive consequences. Without help, it is impossible to stop. Help and recovery are available for everyone involved.<br>

                            Sex addiction is characterized by sexually self-destructive thinking and behaviors. Whether male or female, married, in a committed relationship or single, lust is at the core of sex addiction. The sex addict is sex drunk like alcohol addiction, and cannot control or stop the behaviors. The brain is significantly altered by all addictions. Thoughts and behaviors become all-consuming. Like all addictions, the sex addict is dying of shame, guilt, remorse, fear, emptiness and loneliness. The spiralling out-of-control cycle takes the sex addict deeper and deeper into sex addiction; to depths the addict never dreamed possible. Driven to despair by the overwhelming power and control of lust and the resulting behaviours, risks and attitudes, the sex addict begins taking stock of the devastation it has caused in their life. Families and loved ones are agonizingly impacted by the sex addicts lifestyle and pervasive consequences. Without help, it is impossible to stop.<br>

                            Twelve step programs have been around for a very long time; more than 75 years. These are self-help groups that addicts in recovery or those trying to get recovery attend and explore. Millions and millions of lives around the globe have been saved by those practicing the principles of the 12-step programs and doing the work. The backbone of the program is one addict helping another to achieve sobrietywhatever the addiction is. I am not suggesting that the 12-step programs replace therapy. Instead I am suggesting that 12-step groups often supplement therapy. Many (but not all) reputable and long-established inpatient treatment centres incorporate 12-step groups and meetings into their therapeutic programs with their clients while in treatment. The clients are generally encouraged to continue with 12-step groups post-treatment. The Pros and cons debates have continued in all of those 75+ years and I am sure, will continue to be debated further. You may be willing to attend 12-step meetings in your community, or you may not. The decision will always rest in your hands.<br>

                            I recognize the courage you are showing by exploring options for support. I am interested in the journey that has taken you to this moment and I will provide a non-judgmental and collaborative space to explore your story, your feelings, your barriers, and your hopes for the future. I believe that we are all vulnerable to finding ourselves stuck in patterns that dont serve us well. I also believe in every persons ability to get unstuck and lead a fulfilling life and to maintain relationships that are meaningful, trusting, and fulfilling. <br>

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (also known as CBT) is a short-term and goal oriented treatment that takes a hands-on, practical approach to solving problems. CBT is short-term; addressing a wide spectrum of issues in a persons life, from sleeping difficulties, health concerns and relationship issues, to anxiety, depression and addictions. CBT offers techniques and strategies that can be incorporated into your daily living. CBT is highly adaptive, it is structured, it is cross-cultural, and focuses on thoughts, feelings, behaviors and belief systems. It deals with both the underlying issues in conjunction with behavioral issues. It is highly effective. Megan uses CBT and various interventions, therapies and skills gained through training, education and experience to help you find the answers to your concerns within yourself.<br>

                            Grief and Loss are natural reactions to the death of a loved one, or any major life change like an illness, a career change, divorce, betrayal, or severed relationships. Grief can trigger acute physical and emotional anguish and overwhelm us. If left untreated, this suffering may go on for months or years; for some decades. Grief and Loss Counselling is designed to help individuals move through all the stages of the grieving process, and not get stuck or remain stuck in the process. Counselling helps resolve anger, helplessness, hopelessness, depression, sadness, fears and anxietywhatever you are dealing with. Grieving produces very powerful feelings, and for some shutting off those feelings is the coping mechanism that may work for a time, but will keep resurfacing until those powerful feelings are dealt with. Sometimes lifes responsibilities can distract us from facing our grief and dealing with it; until we feel numb inside or wondering if life is worth living. Working through your loss in Grief Counselling sessions, whatever your loss, can prevent the negative physical, emotional and social side effects that come from ignoring the emotions after any painful loss. The process is different for everyonesome try to work through it on their own but find that it resurfaces through depression, anxiety, fears, loneliness, physical illness. Counselling therapy is not a quick fix for grief.your own unique process cannot be rushed. With help you will discover the stages of grief/grieving, where you are in your grieving process, and in the process find out so much about yourself.<br>

                            Anger is a normal, usually healthy emotion. Anger is not a behavior. Anger is intended to protect us from harm, help us get our needs met, and to keep us from falling into despair. Managed correctly or kept in check, anger is a healthy ally in our lives. Conversely, stuffing feelings down, pretending you have dealt with them, or finally exploding or getting loaded; these are not healthy ways of dealing with anger. Sometimes depression is anger turned inwards. When anger fuels aggressive or destructive behaviours, it is definitely problematic and can lead to legal issues. Anger, the behavior, can alienate us from people, it can be destructive in our significant relationships, and can push us further into isolation, loneliness and despair. It can fuel guilt, shame, remorse and inferiority. Anger, the behavior, can lead us to do things we will regret. Anger can be fueled by past events, maybe from our childhood that is playing out in a current triggering situation. Anger can be a sign that a deeper underlying mental health issue is present. Anger is a serious problem when abuse, aggression and/or violence are present. Drug and alcohol may mask issues of anger temporarily; but drugs and alcohol use may make anger worse. If you find yourself tense, frustrated, simmering just below the surface, arguing with people often, people dont want to be around or they disappoint you, and it is possible you or a loved one has problems with the feeling and the behavior. Anger control is difficult for many people. Anger can be abusive to self and others. Anger can turn into rage. With help, the client who struggles with anger issues can uncover what lies at the root of their frustration or rage. The client can identify their triggers and learn healthy coping or avoidant strategies and skills. They also learn what their relapse cycle is and learn to abort the relapsing behavior before it spirals out of control.<br>

                            A healthy sense of self notably impacts how we feel and function in the world. Self-esteem is our basic sense of worth and value. Low self-esteem can mean constant self-doubt, self-criticism, and an inferior ego state, and mental health issues. Abuse, supressed anger, loneliness, isolation, depression and shame fuel low self-esteem. The lack of positive reinforcement and encouragement while growing up can have lasting scars on self-esteem. Negative core beliefs that were instilled in us growing up can keep our self-worth and esteem low. Criticism, bullying, peer pressure, abandonment and rejection also have negative impact on an individuals self-esteem, worth and value. We can develop a healthier positive self-esteem and value.<br>

                            For some people change, which are inevitable, results in rolling with the punches. However for many, change is more challenging. Lifes transitions no matter what they are can significantly impact how we interact in the world; they can knock us off balance. Change is situational while transition is psychological. Our inner reorientation and redefined meaning helps incorporate the change, or may set up resistance to the change. Some transitions are voluntary, however some are involuntary. We may feel equipped for the transitions like a move, going off to school, or becoming an empty nester, and then discover that we were not prepared for the transition component of the change. When our life path suddenly goes off the rails we can be shaken to our very core. Some life transitions leave us feeling vulnerable and uncertain about our future. Many transitions begin with some kind of ending. Sometimes in those ending, we leave unfinished business behind. When the transition is difficult, it is important to go back and explore that unfinished business, or whatever is holding us back. Often fear, anxiety, even depression get triggered, and we may find ourselves locked in and not able to move forward. We can build on transitional strengths from our past that can help us move forward into our present situation and our future.<br>

                            Codependency is a psychological condition that may have begun in childhood, surfaces as a result of physical, emotional or sexual abuse, and left untreated has a way of penetrating our everyday living. Most codependents place a lower value on themselves and their needs in relationships. Codependency appears in relationships: family, peers, work, intimate relationships, and relationship with self. Often denial, compliance, passivity, abuse, poor self-esteem, controlling, or being controlled are all signs and symptoms of codependency. Working on your codependency issues can have a significant positive impact on your life. The benefits are great to working on codependency. You can have better self-esteem, have a voice and an opinion, give up the need to control self or others, stop the abuse in your life, and any self-abuse issues. Your relationships can improve greatly and become more satisfying. You can grow in many directions.<br>

                            Healthy relationships allow both unique individuals to feel supported and connected while interacting with each other interdependently. Healthy communication and healthy boundaries are two major components that contribute to healthy relationships. Both people in the relationship decide what is healthy and what is not. If something doesnt feel right, you should be able to express and discuss this with your partner. Dealing constructively with conflict, listening and hearing each other; these skills help strengthen the relationship. Sometimes partners do not express what they really want or feel until they find themselves in therapy. Some people come to therapy to get an issue out on the table and begin dealing with it with professional support for both. Saying no when you mean no sets clear boundaries, helps define the relationship, who you are, and who the other person is. Saying yes when you mean no does not contribute to a healthy relationship. Your consent can be taken back or changed at any time, and there is no such thing as implied consent in healthy relationships. Unhealthy communication can lead to conflictand a mountain of unresolved conflict and resentments over time can destroy the relationship and create abusiveness. Whether you are struggling in a relationship, wanting to learn how to be healthier in your new relationship, or ending a relationship and wanting to work on yourself, doing relationship work is a gift you give yourself and others. Some clients come to therapy to do some deeper work on their relationship with themselves to make it healthier. Doing relationship work produces more healthy enriching relationships. Relationship work includes communication, boundaries, openness, honesty, trust, unconditional love and intimacy as integral components of the relationship with healthy boundaries and healthy communication. Abuse (perpetrated by either a female or male) is never acceptable in a relationship and help and safety should be sought immediately.<br>

                            Megan trained, completed supervised practicums, and practiced with a team in the field of Expressive Arts Therapy for 5 years. Some of her clients prefer Expressive Arts Therapy while others prefer the more traditional approaches in therapy. Expressive Arts Therapy is a longer session; 2 hours from beginning to end. Clients who want EAT, generally start off in the traditional modes of therapy, moving into and exploring certain issues using EAT. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can easily be incorporated into EAT. <br>

                            Drug addicts fall in love with the good feelings that alcohol and other drugs produce. For some addicts they fall in love with the euphoria their drug gives them. For others, it numbs feelings. And for others, they feel invincible and unconquerable. Addicts mistakenly believe that they are not harming themselves or others. The brain is significantly altered by all addictions. Addicts stop using only when the pain and heartache of using hurts so much that they have to stop using in order to survive. Addiction is cunning, baffling, powerful, and extremely patient. Relapsing (recidivism) is part of the addiction; not recovery. Whether it is abuse or dependency, there is a way out that doesnt have to lead to death. Approximately 1 in 10 individuals are addicted to drugs and alcohol in our country today. Families and loved ones are agonizingly impacted by the drug addict or alcoholics addiction and the pervasive consequences. Without help, it is impossible to stop. Help and recovery are available for everyone involved.<br>

                            Like all addictive behaviours, gambling addiction destroys lives; from finances and families, relationships and careers, to self-worth, self-esteem and sanity. Treating addictive behaviors is no different than treating addictive substances. As with all addictions, gambling may start out as a social activity, labelled harmless. The brain is significantly altered by all addictions. It is only when the compulsions spiral out of control and take over the life of the addict, does the addict begin to realize that s/he is drowning in gambling addiction with no foreseeable way out. Whether it is being hooked on the slots, sports, the horses, online poker, or casinos, etc., the loss of control is always the same along with lying, deceit and broken promises. Lying, borrowing money, stealing, being fired from your job, selling household furniture to get the fixthe trail of compulsive gambling and its highway of destruction is inescapable. The carelessness towards our family and loved ones, the potential for self-harm and self-destruction are often are the precursors to getting help and getting into recovery. Family members and loved ones are agonizingly impacted by the compulsive gamblers addiction and the pervasive consequences. Without help, it is impossible to stop. Help and recovery are available for everyone involved.<br>

                            Sex addiction is characterized by sexually self-destructive thinking and behaviors. Whether male or female, married, in a committed relationship or single, lust is at the core of sex addiction. The sex addict is sex drunk like alcohol addiction, and cannot control or stop the behaviors. The brain is significantly altered by all addictions. Thoughts and behaviors become all-consuming. Like all addictions, the sex addict is dying of shame, guilt, remorse, fear, emptiness and loneliness. The spiralling out-of-control cycle takes the sex addict deeper and deeper into sex addiction; to depths the addict never dreamed possible. Driven to despair by the overwhelming power and control of lust and the resulting behaviours, risks and attitudes, the sex addict begins taking stock of the devastation it has caused in their life. Families and loved ones are agonizingly impacted by the sex addicts lifestyle and pervasive consequences. Without help, it is impossible to stop.<br>

                            Twelve step programs have been around for a very long time; more than 75 years. These are self-help groups that addicts in recovery or those trying to get recovery attend and explore. Millions and millions of lives around the globe have been saved by those practicing the principles of the 12-step programs and doing the work. The backbone of the program is one addict helping another to achieve sobrietywhatever the addiction is. I am not suggesting that the 12-step programs replace therapy. Instead I am suggesting that 12-step groups often supplement therapy. Many (but not all) reputable and long-established inpatient treatment centres incorporate 12-step groups and meetings into their therapeutic programs with their clients while in treatment. The clients are generally encouraged to continue with 12-step groups post-treatment. The Pros and cons debates have continued in all of those 75+ years and I am sure, will continue to be debated further. You may be willing to attend 12-step meetings in your community, or you may not. The decision will always rest in your hands.<br>
