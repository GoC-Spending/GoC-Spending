              </h4>
           
              Client: JSI Telecom Inc. <br>
<br>
JSI Telecom is a leader in collection management programs and analysis for law enforcement and intelligence organizations. Headquartered in Kanata, Ontario, they offer clients training, cell site mapping, technical support, and more.<br>
<br>
Challenge<br>
JSI Telecom needs to translate highly sensitive information for law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This requires exacting, high-quality reliability and attention to detail in translations in a range of languages, such as French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, and Arabic. “Our clients require the utmost in security and due diligence,” explains Patti Waddell, Senior Technical Writer with Localization Prime, part of JSI.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, previous efforts to utilize machine translation had proven ineffective and failed to reach the standard required. “It was coming out unbelievably garbled. We learned that from our people in the field,” Waddell says.<br>
<br>
The problem was not confined to service delivery; it was impacting business development as well. “It comes down to credibility. We’d be standing in front of a client at a presentation and they’d be reacting to the translation on the screen and the quality was literally so bad our audience would laugh out loud. Trainers trying to explain something in a different language would often get caught out with a mistranslation on the screen and have to apologize as they explained things.”<br>
<br>
This situation threatened their core business, and they needed to adapt quickly to provide better outcomes for their clients.<br>
<br>
Solution<br>
JSI Telecom began to search for a company that could outperform the machine translation they had been receiving. <br>
As JSI’s team was considering a number of software localization vendors, a colleague forwarded them a timely communication from Art One Translations. “We had a document coming out and used it as a test piece,” Waddell says. “They were so professional, so organized and they just blew the competition out of the water with their turnaround time and quality of translations. They just nailed it—and we knew then that they could do the work.”<br>
<br>
Since that first collaboration JSI has used Art One Translations for all their software localization needs: from interface and strings translations, documentation updates, and formatting in Framemaker to installation and maintenance guides, release notes, warranty and service agreements, online help texts, marketing documents, and more.<br>
<br>
Results<br>
Having Art One Translations take care of all of JSI’s translation and software localization needs has not just eliminated the problem of mistranslations—it has given their firm the confidence to take on more complex challenges for their clients. <br>
<br>
“Translating Arabic, for instance, comes with many technical challenges, but Art One has delivered beyond our expectations,” Waddell has commented. “Before, the cost overruns on that language alone was 100 percent over budget; Art One does the work on budget and in half the time! We can see that in all that they do, they put so much integrity into it. Communication is good, they check timelines and they save us a lot of internal time and resources in the process. On a recent Arabic translation project, we saved over $50,000 and two months.”<br>
<br>
Art One Translations has enabled JSI to win new business. On business development documentation like RFPs with prospective customers, their fast turn-around time and reliability has been a “game-changer”.<br>
<br>

Client: Ramius Corporation<br>
 <br>
About Ramius Corporation<br>
Ramius Corporation is a leading Canadian social software and services firm. They specialize in developing online community and social network-based, leading-edge solutions to enterprise customers, which have included major players like SAP and NASA. <br>
Having adapted to marketplace changes several times since their founding in 1998, they developed Sixtent, a social networking system for enterprises that engages stakeholders through collaborative tools. The system offers unparalleled user control and privacy, performance, scalability, security, and flexibility. <br>
<br>
Building on these capabilities due to customer demand and seeing the qualitative rise of social networks as market research-gathering mediums, Ramius saw an opportunity in 2011 to further expand their repertoire and serve a profitable new business niche. To this end, the firm has developed Recollective, which provides an innovative integrated toolset offering online research capabilities for their customers in an overwhelmingly international marketplace.<br>
<br>
The prospective client base for Recollective included many American market research firms that would in turn need to gather feedback and opinions from a range of international audiences in multiple languages.<br>
<br>
Challenge<br>
In order to achieve success with Recollective, they would need to localize their software to enable their clients to use this toolset in a range of languages, beginning with French, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. Users would need to feel fully comfortable with the social network options and tools presented naturally in their own language, or they wouldn’t use the product, leaving Ramius’ market research clients in an untenable position.<br>
<br>
“You’re not even a player in this research market with an English-only platform,” says Phil Dame, COO (Chief Operations Officer) with Ramius. “Even serving market research firms only doing work in Canada, you need French. In the USA, you need Spanish.”<br>
To make the market research gathering effort for clients as seamless as possible, they needed to go far beyond a one-time translation of Recollective’s user interface, including menu options, help tips, and more. “We wanted to internationalize, but we knew we would have to outsource, given the full complexity around translation management,” Dame says. “It’s difficult enough from a technology perspective, but even more from a logistics perspective. <br>
<br>
“This was not something we could realistically handle in-house. We would be dealing with a software product that’s constantly evolving. We were starting with a few languages, but knew we were going to grow to dozens of languages, eventually.” <br>
They recognized this was not a project they could handle on their own. From a project management perspective alone, it wouldn’t be feasible. “How would we find translators? How could we ensure quality control? Who would review their work? How would we deal with revisions? All of these considerations would add far too much overhead to do the work ourselves.”<br>
<br>
They needed to find a software localization solution. Foregoing such a clear opportunity to expand their business was unthinkable.<br>
<br>
Solution<br>
After a thorough review process of eight competing software localization firms, Ramius chose Art One Translations to take on the project. <br>
<br>
“The final decision came from a combination of things, from the effective manner in which she managed the interaction with translators, to the pricing and the trustworthy brand appeal of their firm,” Dame says. “We knew they were one of the translation services used by a large telecom security firm based out of Ottawa, which impressed us. Art One also offered a diverse range of languages and was competitive in all respects with the other firms we reviewed.”<br>
<br>
Results<br>
The software localization process rolled out on time and on budget, enabling Ramius to launch their Recollective offering to win significant new business on an ongoing basis. “Art One Translations enabled us to internationalize our business at a critical juncture,” Dame says. “They are able to manage the quality assurance and review process and we don’t have to worry about it. If I send incremental files with anywhere between 100 keys and 20,000 keys, I just send out an email and they take care of it.”<br>
This major project turned into an ongoing business relationship with Art One Translations enabling new clients to use the expanded toolset in other languages as needed. “Our sales to international clients are certainly tied to us having an available language. That’s a minimum, just to do these deals, which can be in the tens of thousands of dollars or more. Art One has the reliability and quick turnaround time that enables us to win the contracts over our competitors. Being able to get things done in weeks and not months is critical to getting these deals done.”<br>

Client: Thoughtexchange<br>
<br>
About Thoughtexchange <br>
Thoughtexchange, based out of Rossland, B.C., has developed a Group Insight Platform™ that leverages concepts in crowd sourcing, interest-based negotiation, and experiential education to strengthen the education sector. <br>
Their clients include school districts and other organizations that need to engage tens of thousands of people in a meaningful conversation. Their program facilitates leadership and fosters valuable input and feedback from a wide range of stakeholders.<br>
Thoughtexchange has been formally recognized by industry analysts as a B.C. company ready for rapid traction and growth in the information technology sector.<br>
<br>
Challenge<br>
As a rapidly-growing company focused on the education sector, Thoughtexchange was facing strong competition in their chosen marketplace. <br>
<br>
The company had seen excellent growth initially, but the leadership team had aggressive plans for sales; they recognized that an English-only user interface would hinder their ability to move into regional markets in eastern Canada, the southern USA, and Latin America. Customers were requesting such expansion, and they had to respond. In particular, they needed to be able to offer a French option for Canadians in Quebec and elsewhere, as well as Spanish and Armenian options for communities in places like California and Texas.<br>
<br>
Software localization would be an ongoing requirement. To successfully negotiate deals with education districts and provide a positive user experience, they would need translations for their interface, strings, and supporting documentation, such as the software participant terms of use. <br>
<br>
Solution<br>
Thoughtexchange sought out a software localization service provider that could handle their ongoing needs in a timely manner to enable them to achieve their business goals. They found Art One through a positive word-of-mouth referral. “Through testing, we discovered that Art One Translations is incredibly responsive,” says Shelly Bezanson, Release Manager with Thoughtexchange. <br>
“We use them because they stack up so well against their competition. They’re accurate and timely—we can just send them a list of what we need and they get it back to us. Even on short notice, they do their best to accommodate any last-minute requests. Their translations are easy to incorporate into our software.”<br>
<br>
They appreciate that Art One sources translators who use the target language as their native language. “If we’re getting a translation into Spanish, it’s by someone who lives and breathes Spanish. I know care went into this process.”<br>
The cost of software localization was also less than Bezanson expected. “We’ve had no surprises, budget-wise. It’s excellent value.”<br>
<br>
Art One’s fast response time has been impressive, Bezanson notes. “We had a recent release that got bumped up earlier than expected. We were late getting our documentation to Art One and a holiday weekend was coming up. Art One reassured us that their Spanish translators were on different holidays and they managed to coordinate an international effort that was opposite to our working day to get us what we needed.” <br>

Results<br>
Art One’s reliable software localization services have enabled Thoughtexchange to meet and possibly even exceed their goals for growth in targeted sectors. “We’re so much more inclusive now,” Bezanson says. “Being able to provide the experience in someone’s native language was huge.”<br>
<br>
 “If you’re looking for someone who is responsive and cares about you as a client, I would recommend Art One Translations without hesitation!”<br>

              Art One has exceeded my expectations in every area of our interactions. From project forecasting to delivery, Olena and her team of translators is outstanding. The translations are the best we’ve had in the history of the company. Any small issues that arise are dealt with promptly and to our total satisfaction. We have thrown some fairly challenging projects to them over the years and they have always come through with the same degree of excellence. As I said, exceeding expectations every time.<br>
Working with Art Oneis a pleasure and a huge benefit to our organization.<br>

Our sales to international clients are certainly tied to us having an available language. That’s a minimum, just to do these deals, which can be in the tens of thousands of dollars or more. Art One has the reliability and quick turnaround time that enables us to win the contracts over our competitors. Being able to get things done in weeks and not months is critical to getting these deals done.<br>

Translating Arabic, for instance, comes with many technical challenges, but Art One has delivered beyond our expectations. Before, the cost overruns on that language alone was 100 percent over budget; Art One does the work on budget and in half the time! We can see that in all that they do, they put so much integrity into it. Communication is good, they check timelines and they save us a lot of internal time and resources in the process. On a recent Arabic translation project, we saved over $50,000 and two months.<br>

Through testing, we discovered that Art One Translations is incredibly responsive. We use them because they stack up so well against their competition. They’re accurate and timely – we can just send them a list of what we need and they get it back to us. Even on short notice, they do their best to accommodate any last-minute requests. Their translations are easy to incorporate into our software.<br>

Art One Translations provided us prompt and correct translations for a piece of software that is currently deployed in offices in Quebec, Canada.  They were quite thorough in ensuring the translated text would match the context of the original, which is especially important for software as many sentences and labels may be more terse than usual.  They are language experts and were able to give suggestions for original English text that was unclear or bad grammar.  We were fully satisfied with the service from Art One Translations.  <br>

Our project required translation of several manuals and our industry / technology is very specific and specialist.<br>
The time frame tight and the level of accuracy required absolute.<br>
<br>
Throughout the process Art One Translations were very responsive, open and clear giving us confidence.<br>
The fully formatted 18,000 word manual translated result was remarkably precise, accurate, in context and exact; that given a very short timescale to work within. It is of note that the original was Korean, translated into English then German. Communication throughout was excellent and the finished product equally so. The work was checked by a German specialist engineer and required no changes.<br>

Terrific work! Thank you very much for the precise and dedicated work throughout this effort. I’m so pleased to know our translations are in such great hands.<br>
<br>
Once again, I just want to say how much your hard work and dedication to keeping this project on track means to not only me, but the executive team here at JSI. I knew you would come through, but you proved it to them as well.<br>

Thank you very much; I’ve received the documents (many thanks for formatting them as well). <br>
I’ve really enjoyed dealing with you from the very beginning: your response was fast, the quote was very detailed and descriptive and turnaround time was awesome! I will definitely contact you again for our future needs and recommend your company to others.<br>

It is great these days to find somebody that responds to emails promptly both pre-sales and while the project is going on. The responses are always professional and to the point. The translation work her company did for us (captions for a marketing video) was very cost effective, and even for a highly technical product, they were very accurate (we had them reviewed by customers). We hope to use her for future projects as well.<br>

Art One&#39;s translation services were completed as promised, sometimes on tight deadlines, with no deficiencies. I highly recommend Olena and Art One Translations.<br>

Art One Translations have done many translations of documents from letters to foreign presidents, production manuals, diagrams, and other documents. In my case four different languages. Olena is of high integrity, very punctual; one time I was in a meeting and needed another document translated that would help close a sale. I phoned from the customer&#39;s office, within an hour Olena had the translated document emailed to me, we got the sale. Thanks Art One Translations.<br>

It was great to work with Olena on the translation of our website. It was made easy for us and was done in an efficient, timely manner. I would definitely recommend Art One Translations!<br>

Thank you for your team’s work on our production. The project came together well, and our client was quite satisfied with the result. We appreciate the hard work and determination your people put into the project, and the attention to detail you exhibited in making sure the translation was exactly what we needed – in particular, when you recognized that the written words on screen were missed by us and you offered translation of those as well. <br>
We’ll be contacting you when the next project, which we are already working on, is ready for translation.<br>
Thanks so much,<br>

Art One Translations have been a pleasure to work with. Olena always finds a way to accommodate our needs. She has managed several high quality English to Spanish or Chinese translations for us, usually with very short notice. Highly recommended.<br>

JSI Telecom is a leader in collection management programs and analysis for law enforcement and intelligence organizations. Headquartered in Kanata, Ontario, they offer clients training, cell site mapping, technical support, and more.<br>
<br>
Challenge<br>
JSI Telecom needs to translate highly sensitive information for law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This requires exacting, high-quality reliability and attention to detail in translations in a range of languages, such as French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, and Arabic. “Our clients require the utmost in security and due diligence,” explains Patti Waddell, Senior Technical Writer with Localization Prime, part of JSI.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, previous efforts to utilize machine translation had proven ineffective and failed to reach the standard required. “It was coming out unbelievably garbled. We learned that from our people in the field,” Waddell says.<br>
<br>
The problem was not confined to service delivery; it was impacting business development as well. “It comes down to credibility. We’d be standing in front of a client at a presentation and they’d be reacting to the translation on the screen and the quality was literally so bad our audience would laugh out loud. Trainers trying to explain something in a different language would often get caught out with a mistranslation on the screen and have to apologize as they explained things.”<br>
<br>
This situation threatened their core business, and they needed to adapt quickly to provide better outcomes for their clients.<br>
<br>
Solution<br>
JSI Telecom began to search for a company that could outperform the machine translation they had been receiving. <br>
As JSI’s team was considering a number of software localization vendors, a colleague forwarded them a timely communication from Art One Translations. “We had a document coming out and used it as a test piece,” Waddell says. “They were so professional, so organized and they just blew the competition out of the water with their turnaround time and quality of translations. They just nailed it—and we knew then that they could do the work.”<br>
<br>
Since that first collaboration JSI has used Art One Translations for all their software localization needs: from interface and strings translations, documentation updates, and formatting in Framemaker to installation and maintenance guides, release notes, warranty and service agreements, online help texts, marketing documents, and more.<br>
<br>
Results<br>
Having Art One Translations take care of all of JSI’s translation and software localization needs has not just eliminated the problem of mistranslations—it has given their firm the confidence to take on more complex challenges for their clients. <br>
<br>
“Translating Arabic, for instance, comes with many technical challenges, but Art One has delivered beyond our expectations,” Waddell has commented. “Before, the cost overruns on that language alone was 100 percent over budget; Art One does the work on budget and in half the time! We can see that in all that they do, they put so much integrity into it. Communication is good, they check timelines and they save us a lot of internal time and resources in the process. On a recent Arabic translation project, we saved over $50,000 and two months.”<br>
<br>
Art One Translations has enabled JSI to win new business. On business development documentation like RFPs with prospective customers, their fast turn-around time and reliability has been a “game-changer”.<br>

Client: Ramius Corporation<br>
 <br>
About Ramius Corporation<br>
Ramius Corporation is a leading Canadian social software and services firm. They specialize in developing online community and social network-based, leading-edge solutions to enterprise customers, which have included major players like SAP and NASA. <br>
Having adapted to marketplace changes several times since their founding in 1998, they developed Sixtent, a social networking system for enterprises that engages stakeholders through collaborative tools. The system offers unparalleled user control and privacy, performance, scalability, security, and flexibility. <br>
<br>
Building on these capabilities due to customer demand and seeing the qualitative rise of social networks as market research-gathering mediums, Ramius saw an opportunity in 2011 to further expand their repertoire and serve a profitable new business niche. To this end, the firm has developed Recollective, which provides an innovative integrated toolset offering online research capabilities for their customers in an overwhelmingly international marketplace.<br>
<br>
The prospective client base for Recollective included many American market research firms that would in turn need to gather feedback and opinions from a range of international audiences in multiple languages.<br>
<br>
Challenge<br>
In order to achieve success with Recollective, they would need to localize their software to enable their clients to use this toolset in a range of languages, beginning with French, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. Users would need to feel fully comfortable with the social network options and tools presented naturally in their own language, or they wouldn’t use the product, leaving Ramius’ market research clients in an untenable position.<br>
<br>
“You’re not even a player in this research market with an English-only platform,” says Phil Dame, COO (Chief Operations Officer) with Ramius. “Even serving market research firms only doing work in Canada, you need French. In the USA, you need Spanish.”<br>
To make the market research gathering effort for clients as seamless as possible, they needed to go far beyond a one-time translation of Recollective’s user interface, including menu options, help tips, and more. “We wanted to internationalize, but we knew we would have to outsource, given the full complexity around translation management,” Dame says. “It’s difficult enough from a technology perspective, but even more from a logistics perspective. <br>
<br>
“This was not something we could realistically handle in-house. We would be dealing with a software product that’s constantly evolving. We were starting with a few languages, but knew we were going to grow to dozens of languages, eventually.” <br>
They recognized this was not a project they could handle on their own. From a project management perspective alone, it wouldn’t be feasible. “How would we find translators? How could we ensure quality control? Who would review their work? How would we deal with revisions? All of these considerations would add far too much overhead to do the work ourselves.”<br>
<br>
They needed to find a software localization solution. Foregoing such a clear opportunity to expand their business was unthinkable.<br>
<br>
Solution<br>
After a thorough review process of eight competing software localization firms, Ramius chose Art One Translations to take on the project. <br>
<br>
“The final decision came from a combination of things, from the effective manner in which she managed the interaction with translators, to the pricing and the trustworthy brand appeal of their firm,” Dame says. “We knew they were one of the translation services used by a large telecom security firm based out of Ottawa, which impressed us. Art One also offered a diverse range of languages and was competitive in all respects with the other firms we reviewed.”<br>
<br>
Results<br>
The software localization process rolled out on time and on budget, enabling Ramius to launch their Recollective offering to win significant new business on an ongoing basis. “Art One Translations enabled us to internationalize our business at a critical juncture,” Dame says. “They are able to manage the quality assurance and review process and we don’t have to worry about it. If I send incremental files with anywhere between 100 keys and 20,000 keys, I just send out an email and they take care of it.”<br>
This major project turned into an ongoing business relationship with Art One Translations enabling new clients to use the expanded toolset in other languages as needed. “Our sales to international clients are certainly tied to us having an available language. That’s a minimum, just to do these deals, which can be in the tens of thousands of dollars or more. Art One has the reliability and quick turnaround time that enables us to win the contracts over our competitors. Being able to get things done in weeks and not months is critical to getting these deals done.”<br>

Client: Thoughtexchange<br>
<br>
About Thoughtexchange <br>
Thoughtexchange, based out of Rossland, B.C., has developed a Group Insight Platform™ that leverages concepts in crowd sourcing, interest-based negotiation, and experiential education to strengthen the education sector. <br>
Their clients include school districts and other organizations that need to engage tens of thousands of people in a meaningful conversation. Their program facilitates leadership and fosters valuable input and feedback from a wide range of stakeholders.<br>
Thoughtexchange has been formally recognized by industry analysts as a B.C. company ready for rapid traction and growth in the information technology sector.<br>
<br>
Challenge<br>
As a rapidly-growing company focused on the education sector, Thoughtexchange was facing strong competition in their chosen marketplace. <br>
<br>
The company had seen excellent growth initially, but the leadership team had aggressive plans for sales; they recognized that an English-only user interface would hinder their ability to move into regional markets in eastern Canada, the southern USA, and Latin America. Customers were requesting such expansion, and they had to respond. In particular, they needed to be able to offer a French option for Canadians in Quebec and elsewhere, as well as Spanish and Armenian options for communities in places like California and Texas.<br>
<br>
Software localization would be an ongoing requirement. To successfully negotiate deals with education districts and provide a positive user experience, they would need translations for their interface, strings, and supporting documentation, such as the software participant terms of use. <br>
<br>
Solution<br>
Thoughtexchange sought out a software localization service provider that could handle their ongoing needs in a timely manner to enable them to achieve their business goals. They found Art One through a positive word-of-mouth referral. “Through testing, we discovered that Art One Translations is incredibly responsive,” says Shelly Bezanson, Release Manager with Thoughtexchange. <br>
“We use them because they stack up so well against their competition. They’re accurate and timely—we can just send them a list of what we need and they get it back to us. Even on short notice, they do their best to accommodate any last-minute requests. Their translations are easy to incorporate into our software.”<br>
<br>
They appreciate that Art One sources translators who use the target language as their native language. “If we’re getting a translation into Spanish, it’s by someone who lives and breathes Spanish. I know care went into this process.”<br>
The cost of software localization was also less than Bezanson expected. “We’ve had no surprises, budget-wise. It’s excellent value.”<br>
<br>
Art One’s fast response time has been impressive, Bezanson notes. “We had a recent release that got bumped up earlier than expected. We were late getting our documentation to Art One and a holiday weekend was coming up. Art One reassured us that their Spanish translators were on different holidays and they managed to coordinate an international effort that was opposite to our working day to get us what we needed.” <br>
<br>
Results<br>
Art One’s reliable software localization services have enabled Thoughtexchange to meet and possibly even exceed their goals for growth in targeted sectors. “We’re so much more inclusive now,” Bezanson says. “Being able to provide the experience in someone’s native language was huge.”<br>
<br>
 “If you’re looking for someone who is responsive and cares about you as a client, I would recommend Art One Translations without hesitation!”<br>

              Art One has exceeded my expectations in every area of our interactions. From project forecasting to delivery, Olena and her team of translators is outstanding. The translations are the best we’ve had in the history of the company. Any small issues that arise are dealt with promptly and to our total satisfaction. We have thrown some fairly challenging projects to them over the years and they have always come through with the same degree of excellence. As I said, exceeding expectations every time.<br>
Working with Art Oneis a pleasure and a huge benefit to our organization.<br>

Art One Translations provided us prompt and correct translations for a piece of software that is currently deployed in offices in Quebec, Canada.  They were quite thorough in ensuring the translated text would match the context of the original, which is especially important for software as many sentences and labels may be more terse than usual.  They are language experts and were able to give suggestions for original English text that was unclear or bad grammar.  We were fully satisfied with the service from Art One Translations.  <br>

Our project required translation of several manuals and our industry / technology is very specific and specialist.<br>
The time frame tight and the level of accuracy required absolute.<br>
<br>
Throughout the process Art One Translations were very responsive, open and clear giving us confidence.<br>
The fully formatted 18,000 word manual translated result was remarkably precise, accurate, in context and exact; that given a very short timescale to work within. It is of note that the original was Korean, translated into English then German. Communication throughout was excellent and the finished product equally so. The work was checked by a German specialist engineer and required no changes.<br>

Terrific work! Thank you very much for the precise and dedicated work throughout this effort. I’m so pleased to know our translations are in such great hands.<br>

It is great these days to find somebody that responds to emails promptly both pre-sales and while the project is going on. The responses are always professional and to the point. The translation work her company did for us (captions for a marketing video) was very cost effective, and even for a highly technical product, they were very accurate (we had them reviewed by customers). We hope to use her for future projects as well.<br>

Art One Translations have done many translations of documents from letters to foreign presidents, production manuals, diagrams, and other documents. In my case four different languages. Olena is of high integrity, very punctual; one time I was in a meeting and needed another document translated that would help close a sale. I phoned from the customer&#39;s office, within an hour Olena had the translated document emailed to me, we got the sale. Thanks Art One Translations.<br>

Thank you for your team’s work on our production. The project came together well, and our client was quite satisfied with the result. We appreciate the hard work and determination your people put into the project, and the attention to detail you exhibited in making sure the translation was exactly what we needed – in particular, when you recognized that the written words on screen were missed by us and you offered translation of those as well. <br>
We’ll be contacting you when the next project, which we are already working on, is ready for translation.<br>
Thanks so much,<br>
