        <br>            Jer-B-Syl inc. is a plastic baskets and trays manufacturer used for the retail of produces (fruits and vegetables). A new division named I Kkwit also manufactures ashtrays and urban furniture. Please read the following informations.<br><br>Good Day!<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>I Kkwit has now become much more than its 5000 ashtrays and the thousands of other products of incomparable strength and quality, sold in 10 countries to date. Without being pretentious, we are becoming THE standard of many small, medium and large cities and businesses in Canada and in the world. Now that we have proven ourselves, we are launching a full line of indoor and outdoor furniture and believe me the quality is just as unequalled.<br><br> <br><br>Please allow me to send you therefore the all new virtual I Kkwit catalogue including price lists. Please note that all our products are available in 400 colours! And are made in Chambly, Quebec-Canada and, thus providing jobs to our people at home! <br><br>Please consult our enclosed catalogue. For more information visit our website www.ikkwit.com<br><br> <br><br>Titles in RED show our new products.<br><br>ASHTRAYS: Photos, price list and technical information (specs) of our urban ashtrays (15 models).

See photos on http://www.ikkwit.com/Photos/Bollards.aspx <br>The range of protective bollards came about out of necessity. Because of their shape, several customers already asked us if our ashtrays were bollards. So there you have it. In order to match my products, you now find a complete range of bollards to protect your public spaces. They can be installed without having to dig to anchor them. Available in 4 or 6 inches in diameter.<br><br> <br><br>FENCES: You will see on our website that we have used the bollards to make a Fence by using stainless steel cables, the result is fantastic! See photos 18 to 28 on: http://www.ikkwit.com/Photos/Bollards.aspx<br> <br><br>BICYCLE RACKS: RacK@BiKesMD: A new revolutionary bicycle rack made in Quebec!<br>(Name and trademark, designs, worldwide registration, patent pending). <br><br>I guarantee you that you will be impressed with the ingenuity of the unique and absolutely incredible design of our 8 models. We are increasing the amount of bicycles per linear foot and diminish their entanglement there where the whole world entangles scratches and breaks their bicycles by taking too much space for parking! Isnt that wonderful? No more tangled handlebars and broken cables! The support as well as the grounds is easy to maintain. Since it is raised, its concept and unique design allow fitting more bicycles in less space. Moreover, the part that holds the bicycles can be detachable, if we want, allowing for snow removal between the two poles. You should really see it! <br><br> <br><br>Discover our range of bicycle rack model Andréa which will facilitate storage and parking of your bicycles on the floor. And the new model Vert-i-Kal* for storage on the wall. Photos on our web site by clicking on: http://www.ikkwit.com/Photos/Bicycleracks.aspx<br><br> <br><br>* Model Vert-i-Kal: This is a wall mounted bicycle rack for indoor parking, where the bicycle is free standing! It can be put in series on the wall, on a single column and/or several in series on the same column like a Christmas tree. A pure ecstasy of design, the ease-of use when parking the bicycle, its efficiency and above all its a space saver. <br><br> <br><br>SUPPORTS TO STACK EMPTY WINDSHIELD WASHER CONTAINERS: RacK@WasHMD<br> <br><br>        No more overflowing garbage bins, thanks to this innovative new product created by I Kkwit. The base is fixed to the ground                     and the pole is removed to be emptied in the recycling bin. The system is easy to handle and it locks to prevent theft. The 6 feet             high pole contains 17 empty containers!!  With its affordable price, you will want one per pump and one close to your entrance!<br><br> <br><br>        Contact us today to reserve yours as they fly quickly! (Not the empty containers because the RacK@WasHMD is                                     designed to prevent them from flying away.)<br><br> <br><br>        Available in 400 colours, like all our products, they can be painted in the colours of your banner! <br><br>        Another original and improved idea of I Kkwit!<br><br> <br> <br><br>    · SUPPORTS FOR GOLF BAGS: RacK@GolFMD<br><br>        Following a visit to one of my very good customers, Mr. Charles Robillard of Golf de Rouville and on his request, I present you the all         new support for golf bags RacK@GolFMD, nothing less!<br><br>        Whats worse than having to walk with your golf bag instead of leaving it safe at the pier or at the 19th hole! <br><br>        Find THE  I Kkwit Solution on our site. You should see it to understand the unique style of the I Kkwit RacK@GolFMD<br>        <br><br> <br><br>    · HEATED BIRD BATHS: <br><br> <br><br>        You read right! I am designing two models of heated birdbaths for our little friends to drink even in winter! (A request and idea                     from Mother Bourdeau! What do you want? It is in the family). While everyone is talking about LEED, green roofs and green spaces,         we come up with this original idea. Why not recreate the environment and revitalize your green spaces with a                                         heated bird bath! Who knows if the AAT will not increase the productivity of your staff?<br><br>        Photos on http://www.ikkwit.com/Products/BirdBaths.aspx<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>        NEW: Several other products were made &amp;#8203;&amp;#8203;by special order. We remain available for your demands no matter how outrageous                 they might be! You will find some in our section: Custom Orders.<br><br> <br><br>It would be very helpful and appreciated if you could forward this message to your other contacts.

              I Kkwit has now become much more than its 5000 ashtrays and the thousands of other products of incomparable strength and quality, sold in 10 countries to date. Without being pretentious, we are becoming THE standard of many small, medium and large cities and businesses in Canada and in the world. Now that we have proven ourselves, we are launching a full line of indoor and outdoor furniture and believe me the quality is just as unequalled.<br>

              IKkwit manufacturer of the best ashtray and urban furniture ever<br>
<br>
 Ashtray, garbage bins, recycle bins, pic-nic table, bisto table, park bench, bicycle rack, bollard, fence, bird bath, winshield washer stacker I Kkwit, Jer-B-Syl produce plastic basket and trays for fruits and vegetables Chambly, Montreal, Québec, Canada<br>
 <br>
I Kkwit is a Chambly Quebec manufacturer of the best ashtray and urban furniture on the planet earth! It has been said by Sylvain Bourdeau wich is me, the I Kkwit founder and thousands of customers!. There is around 5000 units of I Kkwit ashtrays are actually sold in 10 countries in the world and NONE of them has been destroyed or broken enough for it not to be usable. The Ikkwit solid ashtrays are 1/4 inch thick and if we install them I personnally give a 3 years warranty on them! Nothing is comparable to our exterior ashtray. Please take my words, I made the best outdoor ashtray, wall ashtray or free standing ashtray in the world! Visit ou website www.ikkwit.com if one picture worth a thousand words, what will mean to you more that 4000 pictures!<br>
 <br>
The Rack@Bike bicycle rack are unique in the world also! You will be able to insert almost the double of bicycles in the same usual lenght. I mean that were anybody put 12 bikes, I put 20! 200 units of bicycle in my Rack@Bikes bicycle rack where anybody will put 120! Please read the article in this section.<br>
 <br>
Our garbage bins and recycle bins have a wonderfull look and are durable. Made of aluminum, they will last for years and years, like we say, a picture of our garbage bins will convict you. All my urban furniture fit totally together. <br>
<br>
Our pic-nic tables, bistro tables and park benches are made of aluminum wich is a conductive material. This means that when you sit on it no matter the exterior temperature it will reach your body temperature in an incredible fast time. The surface of the ikkwit pic-nic table, bistro table or park benches are perforated with littles holes wich allows the rain or snow to pass trough it. This will give you the permission to sit on it even if it just rain or snow. <br>
<br>
In 2011, we have put more than 65 new products. The RacK@Golf wich is a special demand is a stand for golf bags or a rack for golf bag, no matter the name you give it, my golfrack does the jobs perfectly with elegance and solidity! The new RacK@WasH is used by many gas stations and the reason is simple! I can hold 17 empty winshield washer fluid contenant! <br>
<br>
The heated bird bath will give the little one a hand to pass trough the winter. The bird bath is heated with a lamp and even if it is les 30 outside the water doesn&#39;t freeze! All CSA and UL approved, this bird bath is available in 400 colours too!<br>
 <br>
Our bollards will protect your business walls, doors or whatever you want to protect! They are solid and decorative in the same time! Our bollard are made of aluminum too, but we put a 1/4 inche thick steele pipe inside. Don&#39;t worry, as one of my customer said after he installed 15 of them because someone pass trough his wall twice.&#39;&#39; Sylvain your bollards really are solid in ... and they do the job!&#39;&#39;<br>
 Finally, my company is also JER-B-SYL inc. For Jerome Bourdeau Sylvain. A plastic bascket company that my father Jerome started in 1976. After being partner with him for almost 25 years I bought the total company from him in 2002 and always continued selling our produce plastic baskets for fruits and vegetable. Go at marché Atwater market in Montreal or in marché Jean-Talon market and I f you dont see thousands of our colored basket you wont see one! Take the time to look under one of them and you will see Jer-B-Syl inc.<br>
 If you have a brief look on our website, just think about the customers that has bought from me and tell me if you think that they were all wrongs. <br>
<br>
Sincerly!<br>

              </h4>
           
              I Kkwit has now become much more than its 5000 ashtrays and the thousands of other products of incomparable strength and quality, sold in 10 countries to date. Without being pretentious, we are becoming THE standard of many small, medium and large cities and businesses in Canada and in the world. Now that we have proven ourselves, we are launching a full line of indoor and outdoor furniture and believe me the quality is just as unequalled.<br>
<br>

              IKkwit manufacturer of the best ashtray and urban furniture ever<br>
<br>
 Ashtray, garbage bins, recycle bins, pic-nic table, bisto table, park bench, bicycle rack, bollard, fence, bird bath, winshield washer stacker I Kkwit, Jer-B-Syl produce plastic basket and trays for fruits and vegetables Chambly, Montreal, Québec, Canada<br>
 <br>
I Kkwit is a Chambly Quebec manufacturer of the best ashtray and urban furniture on the planet earth! It has been said by Sylvain Bourdeau wich is me, the I Kkwit founder and thousands of customers!. There is around 5000 units of I Kkwit ashtrays are actually sold in 10 countries in the world and NONE of them has been destroyed or broken enough for it not to be usable. The Ikkwit solid ashtrays are 1/4 inch thick and if we install them I personnally give a 3 years warranty on them! Nothing is comparable to our exterior ashtray. Please take my words, I made the best outdoor ashtray, wall ashtray or free standing ashtray in the world! Visit ou website www.ikkwit.com if one picture worth a thousand words, what will mean to you more that 4000 pictures!<br>
 <br>
The Rack@Bike bicycle rack are unique in the world also! You will be able to insert almost the double of bicycles in the same usual lenght. I mean that were anybody put 12 bikes, I put 20! 200 units of bicycle in my Rack@Bikes bicycle rack where anybody will put 120! Please read the article in this section.<br>
 <br>
Our garbage bins and recycle bins have a wonderfull look and are durable. Made of aluminum, they will last for years and years, like we say, a picture of our garbage bins will convict you. All my urban furniture fit totally together. <br>
<br>
Our pic-nic tables, bistro tables and park benches are made of aluminum wich is a conductive material. This means that when you sit on it no matter the exterior temperature it will reach your body temperature in an incredible fast time. The surface of the ikkwit pic-nic table, bistro table or park benches are perforated with littles holes wich allows the rain or snow to pass trough it. This will give you the permission to sit on it even if it just rain or snow. <br>
<br>
In 2011, we have put more than 65 new products. The RacK@Golf wich is a special demand is a stand for golf bags or a rack for golf bag, no matter the name you give it, my golfrack does the jobs perfectly with elegance and solidity! The new RacK@WasH is used by many gas stations and the reason is simple! I can hold 17 empty winshield washer fluid contenant! <br>
<br>
The heated bird bath will give the little one a hand to pass trough the winter. The bird bath is heated with a lamp and even if it is les 30 outside the water doesn&#39;t freeze! All CSA and UL approved, this bird bath is available in 400 colours too!<br>
 <br>
Our bollards will protect your business walls, doors or whatever you want to protect! They are solid and decorative in the same time! Our bollard are made of aluminum too, but we put a 1/4 inche thick steele pipe inside. Don&#39;t worry, as one of my customer said after he installed 15 of them because someone pass trough his wall twice.&#39;&#39; Sylvain your bollards really are solid in ... and they do the job!&#39;&#39;<br>
 Finally, my company is also JER-B-SYL inc. For Jerome Bourdeau Sylvain. A plastic bascket company that my father Jerome started in 1976. After being partner with him for almost 25 years I bought the total company from him in 2002 and always continued selling our produce plastic baskets for fruits and vegetable. Go at marché Atwater market in Montreal or in marché Jean-Talon market and I f you dont see thousands of our colored basket you wont see one! Take the time to look under one of them and you will see Jer-B-Syl inc.<br>
 If you have a brief look on our website, just think about the customers that has bought from me and tell me if you think that they were all wrongs. <br>
<br>
Sincerly!<br>
