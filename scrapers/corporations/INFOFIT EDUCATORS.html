Bonjour Sylvain,<br>
This Ragani from your accelerated program which I took at the end of November and beginning of December. I wanted to let you know that I wrote the exam yesterday afternoon and I passed!<br>
You were a wonderful teacher and all the quirky, funny, engaging things you did in class to help us remember were very useful during the exam I could hear your voice or envision your actions that helped me. I even stood up and used my body to help me remember.<br>
Thank you for making my experience so memorable.<br>
 I am glad you were a part of my new career! Five stars for INFOFIT!<br>

Just got hired!!<br>
Hi Sylvain, <br>
Just wanted to email you and let you know that I just got hired on at my local gym as a weight trainer. I began with Fit Theory in the fall with INFOFIT, and I let the manager of the gym know that I was in the process of certifying and wanted to work there, and out of the blue yesterday he called me and asked if I could come in and talk about working for the gym. Pretty cool! I already have 7 clients that I&#39;ll be taking on for 12 weeks starting on the 18th! Wow. I&#39;ll be starting as an on-floor resource for a couple weeks so people get to know me. I&#39;m pretty excited. <br>
Also, I wanted to thank you for the awesome Weight Training course you led two weeks ago. My friend Becca and I had a great couple weekends, and I personally gained a lot of confidence in my skills and abilities going forward into the industry. Thanks for everything! <br>
Cheers, <br>

Fitness Course Review From Rachel Wu<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve got to be really honest..it was a little bit intimidating at first... but everyone at INFOFIT were so friendly and helpful! I got through everything in a very positive environment. If you&#39;re looking into getting certified... it could be overwhelming. (Fit Theory course, INFOFIT final exam, bcrpa fit theory exam, Weight Training course, infofit final exam, ICE exam, Personal Training course, INFOFIT final exam, BCRPA personal training exam, ACE exam)<br>
 <br>
That&#39;s just how I chose to do it... It depends which certificate you&#39;d like to get. No matter which certification you&#39;d like to obtain, I can assure you that INFOFIT exceeds the expectation of the utmost professionalism and they will make sure that you get the best education and knowledge for your future career. I&#39;d like to thank Andre and Sylvain for helping me through with the exam preparations. Sylvain was my course instructor and he would often go out of his way to send me extra teaching material that would help me understand things better.<br>
 <br>
Through the personalized Personal Training course, I was prepared for BCRPA and ACE certification! The best thing is, you&#39;ll also get INFOFIT certified!<br>

INFOFIT Review from Kim Unrau<br>
INFOFIT has changed my life!<br>
In march 2011, I walked into INFOFIT and Della Vorshuk set me up with personal trainer Cathie Glennon (my savior) started me off slowly and in 5 months I was able to go back to work. I also lost 40 pounds and never felt better and have lived a healthy lifestyle ever since. This inspired me to get my PT certification and now I want to help others achieve their goals to be productive and independent, happy and mobile. Thank you INFOFIT for changing my life!! I recommend INFOFIT to everyone!<br>

I didn&#39;t know anything about the science of exercise, though I thought I did. Now I feel much more poised and confident to give sound advice, and to perform in a SAFE and also very effective manner. INFOFIT has provided such diligent professionalism, and inspired me to truly become the Elite Personal Trainer I set out to be. Now I am part of the solution, thank you.<br>

Not long ago, I had no idea about anatomy, physiology or fitness training and how that relates to designing a program for myself. I now understand advanced concepts like energy systems and the different systems in the body and how they all work together. I feel confident in waling into a gym and knowing what to do.<br>
Posted by: Michelle Little, June 2012<br>
<br>
I was new to fitness as well as anatomy and its complexity. I have now progressed into the fitness industry by taking the courses. I learned so much and the instructors are so understanding and communicative.<br>

<br>
When I started the program I only had a little bit of knowledge about the human body and no knowledge about being a Fitness Instructor. Now I am much more confident in general.<br>

<br>
After taking a two year break from the fitness industry (worked as a BCRPA trainer for a few years), I decided to choose Infofit to help me prepare for ACSM &amp; ACE certification. My goal was not only to obtain international certification, but to come back stronger - as a more technical trainer. I wanted to recap on things that were forgotten or rusty, and to hopefully learn new things.<br>
<br>
I admit that I was skeptical about INFOFIT&#39;s Fast Track program, due to its condensed nature. However by the end of the course I was truly impressed. My experience was a very positive one, and I learned so much. I stayed on to be an INFOFIT Informer, and got to experience the different teaching styles of all of the instructors - picking up additional info from each one.<br>
<br>
All of instructors are very proficient. Jon brings his strong kinesiology background, tenure in the industry, and humor to the table. Fran injects humor and a lot of passion into the subject he teaches. He has a very diverse background in fitness, is well educated and has spent a long time in the industry. He was very knowledgeable - as was Andrew with his experience with rehabilitation.<br>
I was blown away by Sylvains vast knowledge and comfortable use of medical terminology. He is very enthusiastic, and works hard to make sure the students master the subject matter. I signed up for the study workshops he conducts, and tutoring with him to further master some of the more complex formulas and prepare for the ACSM exam.<br>
<br>
I not only passed my ACSM exam last week, but got a very good mark! I attribute some of that to Sylvains very comprehensive teaching methods. He also emailed many great study guides.<br>
I came out of the course with a renewed sense of motivation, enthusiasm, and commitment to the fitness industry, and am well on my way to accomplishing the career goals I have set for myself! I have received an abundance of support from INFOFIT, all of which has helped.<br>
In addition to being BCRPA certified, I am now an ACSM CPT, and studying for my ACE exam which I take in two weeks!<br>

Dear INFOFIT team,<br>
I will truly send my thanks to your team specially to Mr. Andre Noel Potvin. I took part in your course in 2006 and had a job offer from IRAN at exactly the same year, I finished my courses in Fitness Leader, Weight Training and Personal training and passed my exam as a BCRPA fitness Leader registered. I moved to IRAN and started my business as a  fitness leader and personal trainer on Omega Sport Clinic (it is a private club). Most of my clients were involved with tennis  because I had a background in tennis sport, so I started to train my client in tennis fitness style.<br>
<br>
INFOFIT had a lots of influences in my life and my training style.<br>
I have designed a program for tennis player as a circuit training in five steps which I called tennis fitness program.<br>
<br>
In 2009, I was invited by the Iranian Tennis Federation  through the National Olympics Committee of Iran invited me as a Physical Training coach of National Tennis Team (National Code No.#0051143313) for Davis Cup Championship in 2010. So It was my honour as a Canadian-Iranian to coach the National Team as a  physical fitness trainer. as you know, it is a dream for any coach to work as a trainer for his national team, specially in Davis cup International Championship.<br>
<br>
My profession that I owe to INFOFIT, lead me to continue my career as a COO in &quot;Zendegi Health and Spa Complex&quot; as well as working on sports Marketing fields as a sports consultant.<br>
<br>
I would like to say thanks again to INFOFIT team.<br>
Kind Regards,<br>

I have understood fitness to be a life changing experience for me. I knew I wanted to share my love with others. Now I feel that I have so much knowledge to pair up with my passion!<br>

I was under the opinion that old school training was the only way to go; a four day split with a little cardio thrown in. I soon realized that keeping an open mind and learning new things could drastically improve and influence my way of setting up a program that has variety, covers all bases and effectively works towards my program goals.<br>

I have wondered if it would be worth my time, effort and money to take the courses. I have determined that yes, it was definitely worth it. I would like to come back for the ATP program. The courses I have taken have provided a great foundation.<br>

I have usually tried to keep what I know to myself. After taking INFOFITs Personal Trainers Program I learned to open up and really connect with people around me.<br>

INFOFIT gave me the tools to pass the ACSM exam. It was a great course and I don&#39;t really know how they could improve on the program to be honest. INFOFIT taught me and how to think logically as a trainer helped me a lot!!!!<br>

Before I attended INFOFIT&#39;s Courses, I was nervous and skeptical, but the teaching methods were fun and informative and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire course. I feel far more confident now in pursuing a career as a Fitness Educator.<br>

Hello, I attended the Exam Prep Workshops with Sylvain Cyr last week, they were fantastic! I just wanted to let you know, I really appreciated them! Thank you!<br>

Hello Andre,  <br>
I passed today the ACSM exam!! 1.5 years ago I was in your school. You was my first mentor and you are a role model. Thank you very much for everything. I wrote my ACSM Exam in English!  I am more proud, because my first language is Swiss and you always supported me, even I barely spoke English. Thank you very much. I never forget that time.<br>

I wasnt very knowledgeable about muscles, bones, joints and planes of motion. INFOFIT really improved my knowledge. I want to continue with the INFOFIT courses and become a very respected and educated Personal Trainer.<br>

Bonjour Sylvain,<br>
This Ragani from your accelerated program which I took at the end of November and beginning of December. I wanted to let you know that I wrote the exam yesterday afternoon and I passed!<br>
You were a wonderful teacher and all the quirky, funny, engaging things you did in class to help us remember were very useful during the exam I could hear your voice or envision your actions that helped me. I even stood up and used my body to help me remember.<br>
Thank you for making my experience so memorable.<br>
 I am glad you were a part of my new career! Five stars for INFOFIT!<br>

Just got hired!!<br>
Hi Sylvain, <br>
Just wanted to email you and let you know that I just got hired on at my local gym as a weight trainer. I began with Fit Theory in the fall with INFOFIT, and I let the manager of the gym know that I was in the process of certifying and wanted to work there, and out of the blue yesterday he called me and asked if I could come in and talk about working for the gym. Pretty cool! I already have 7 clients that I&#39;ll be taking on for 12 weeks starting on the 18th! Wow. I&#39;ll be starting as an on-floor resource for a couple weeks so people get to know me. I&#39;m pretty excited. <br>
Also, I wanted to thank you for the awesome Weight Training course you led two weeks ago. My friend Becca and I had a great couple weekends, and I personally gained a lot of confidence in my skills and abilities going forward into the industry. Thanks for everything! <br>
Cheers, <br>
February 2015<br>

Fitness Course Review From Rachel Wu<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve got to be really honest..it was a little bit intimidating at first... but everyone at INFOFIT were so friendly and helpful! I got through everything in a very positive environment. If you&#39;re looking into getting certified... it could be overwhelming. (Fit Theory course, INFOFIT final exam, bcrpa fit theory exam, Weight Training course, infofit final exam, ICE exam, Personal Training course, INFOFIT final exam, BCRPA personal training exam, ACE exam)<br>
 <br>
That&#39;s just how I chose to do it... It depends which certificate you&#39;d like to get. No matter which certification you&#39;d like to obtain, I can assure you that INFOFIT exceeds the expectation of the utmost professionalism and they will make sure that you get the best education and knowledge for your future career. I&#39;d like to thank Andre and Sylvain for helping me through with the exam preparations. Sylvain was my course instructor and he would often go out of his way to send me extra teaching material that would help me understand things better.<br>
 <br>
Through the personalized Personal Training course, I was prepared for BCRPA and ACE certification! The best thing is, you&#39;ll also get INFOFIT certified!<br>

INFOFIT Review from Kim Unrau<br>
INFOFIT has changed my life!<br>
In march 2011, I walked into INFOFIT and Della Vorshuk set me up with personal trainer Cathie Glennon (my savior) started me off slowly and in 5 months I was able to go back to work. I also lost 40 pounds and never felt better and have lived a healthy lifestyle ever since. This inspired me to get my PT certification and now I want to help others achieve their goals to be productive and independent, happy and mobile. Thank you INFOFIT for changing my life!! I recommend INFOFIT to everyone!<br>

I didn&#39;t know anything about the science of exercise, though I thought I did. Now I feel much more poised and confident to give sound advice, and to perform in a SAFE and also very effective manner. INFOFIT has provided such diligent professionalism, and inspired me to truly become the Elite Personal Trainer I set out to be. Now I am part of the solution, thank you.<br>

Not long ago, I had no idea about anatomy, physiology or fitness training and how that relates to designing a program for myself. I now understand advanced concepts like energy systems and the different systems in the body and how they all work together. I feel confident in waling into a gym and knowing what to do.<br>
Posted by: Michelle Little, June 2012<br>
<br>
I was new to fitness as well as anatomy and its complexity. I have now progressed into the fitness industry by taking the courses. I learned so much and the instructors are so understanding and communicative.<br>

<br>
When I started the program I only had a little bit of knowledge about the human body and no knowledge about being a Fitness Instructor. Now I am much more confident in general.<br>
Posted by: Danielle Rawlings, June 2012<br>
<br>
After taking a two year break from the fitness industry (worked as a BCRPA trainer for a few years), I decided to choose Infofit to help me prepare for ACSM &amp; ACE certification. My goal was not only to obtain international certification, but to come back stronger - as a more technical trainer. I wanted to recap on things that were forgotten or rusty, and to hopefully learn new things.<br>
<br>
I admit that I was skeptical about INFOFIT&#39;s Fast Track program, due to its condensed nature. However by the end of the course I was truly impressed. My experience was a very positive one, and I learned so much. I stayed on to be an INFOFIT Informer, and got to experience the different teaching styles of all of the instructors - picking up additional info from each one.<br>
<br>
All of instructors are very proficient. Jon brings his strong kinesiology background, tenure in the industry, and humor to the table. Fran injects humor and a lot of passion into the subject he teaches. He has a very diverse background in fitness, is well educated and has spent a long time in the industry. He was very knowledgeable - as was Andrew with his experience with rehabilitation.<br>
I was blown away by Sylvains vast knowledge and comfortable use of medical terminology. He is very enthusiastic, and works hard to make sure the students master the subject matter. I signed up for the study workshops he conducts, and tutoring with him to further master some of the more complex formulas and prepare for the ACSM exam.<br>

I not only passed my ACSM exam last week, but got a very good mark! I attribute some of that to Sylvains very comprehensive teaching methods. He also emailed many great study guides.<br>
I came out of the course with a renewed sense of motivation, enthusiasm, and commitment to the fitness industry, and am well on my way to accomplishing the career goals I have set for myself! I have received an abundance of support from INFOFIT, all of which has helped.<br>
In addition to being BCRPA certified, I am now an ACSM CPT, and studying for my ACE exam which I take in two weeks!<br>

Dear INFOFIT team,<br>
I will truly send my thanks to your team specially to Mr. Andre Noel Potvin. I took part in your course in 2006 and had a job offer from IRAN at exactly the same year, I finished my courses in Fitness Leader, Weight Training and Personal training and passed my exam as a BCRPA fitness Leader registered. I moved to IRAN and started my business as a  fitness leader and personal trainer on Omega Sport Clinic (it is a private club). Most of my clients were involved with tennis  because I had a background in tennis sport, so I started to train my client in tennis fitness style.<br>
<br>
INFOFIT had a lots of influences in my life and my training style.<br>
I have designed a program for tennis player as a circuit training in five steps which I called tennis fitness program.<br>
<br>
In 2009, I was invited by the Iranian Tennis Federation  through the National Olympics Committee of Iran invited me as a Physical Training coach of National Tennis Team (National Code No.#0051143313) for Davis Cup Championship in 2010. So It was my honour as a Canadian-Iranian to coach the National Team as a  physical fitness trainer. as you know, it is a dream for any coach to work as a trainer for his national team, specially in Davis cup International Championship.<br>
<br>
My profession that I owe to INFOFIT, lead me to continue my career as a COO in &quot;Zendegi Health and Spa Complex&quot; as well as working on sports Marketing fields as a sports consultant.<br>
<br>
I would like to say thanks again to INFOFIT team.<br>
Kind Regards,<br>

I have understood fitness to be a life changing experience for me. I knew I wanted to share my love with others. Now I feel that I have so much knowledge to pair up with my passion!<br>

I was under the opinion that old school training was the only way to go; a four day split with a little cardio thrown in. I soon realized that keeping an open mind and learning new things could drastically improve and influence my way of setting up a program that has variety, covers all bases and effectively works towards my program goals.<br>

I have wondered if it would be worth my time, effort and money to take the courses. I have determined that yes, it was definitely worth it. I would like to come back for the ATP program. The courses I have taken have provided a great foundation.<br>

I have usually tried to keep what I know to myself. After taking INFOFITs Personal Trainers Program I learned to open up and really connect with people around me.<br>

INFOFIT gave me the tools to pass the ACSM exam. It was a great course and I don&#39;t really know how they could improve on the program to be honest. INFOFIT taught me and how to think logically as a trainer helped me a lot!!!!<br>

Before I attended INFOFIT&#39;s Courses, I was nervous and skeptical, but the teaching methods were fun and informative and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire course. I feel far more confident now in pursuing a career as a Fitness Educator.<br>

Hello Andre,  <br>
I passed today the ACSM exam!! 1.5 years ago I was in your school. You was my first mentor and you are a role model. Thank you very much for everything. I wrote my ACSM Exam in English!  I am more proud, because my first language is Swiss and you always supported me, even I barely spoke English. Thank you very much. I never forget that time.<br>

I wasnt very knowledgeable about muscles, bones, joints and planes of motion. INFOFIT really improved my knowledge. I want to continue with the INFOFIT courses and become a very respected and educated Personal Trainer.<br>
