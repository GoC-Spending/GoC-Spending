<br>
As your organization grew, you added people and then delegated responsibility for Human Resources management to your office manager, generally a Jack or Jill of all trades. Now however, as you have grown in size, managing your people and getting optimum performance from your team requires professional expertise.<br>
<br>
That is where J &amp; V Turner and Associates can help you and your organization get the results you need from your most vital assets: your people.<br>
<br>
With more than 25 years as senior Human Resources professional and as an HR teacher at McMaster University, I have now dedicated my experience and expertise to working with medium-sized, independent companies like yours to enhance the growth and development of their key talent and maximize the management of their valuable people assets at all levels of the business. <br>
<br>
All I ask for is for a few minutes of your time<br>
and Ill show you how our services will virtually pay for themselves.<br>
<br>
To demonstrate my capabilities and outline how we can save your company time, money and aggravation by maximizing your most powerful and valuable asset  your people -- I would like to meet with you for an hour to review your current Human Resources policies and then provide a written recommendation of how I can help improve your current processes to make your HR management deliver greater returns. <br>
Of course, there is no cost or obligation on your part and all shared information is held in the strictest confidence.<br>
<br>
<br>
Delivering Custom HR Solutions<br>
. That Meet Our Clients Unique, Individual Requirements!<br>
<br>
Please invest a few moments to read the enclosed brochure. It outlines the benefits and advantages of the core services we offer. Of course, our key to building successful HR programs for our clients is in identifying and addressing specific areas which need attention and then developing the custom programs which will address the most critical areas of your HR needs.<br>
<br>
I will be calling you in the next week to discuss with you the areas of my services, which are of primary concern for your organization and which I can address in my initial no cost, no-obligation assessment and recommendation. If you have immediate issues I could help you with, please do not hesitate to call me right away to arrange a consultation at your convenience. <br>
<br>
I look forward to meeting with you in the near future to demonstrate how the services I offer to your organization will virtually pay for themselves and generate positive, measurable contributions to your bottom line for years to come.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jim Turner<br>
President<br>
<br>
P.S. -- We also provide our clients with a unique Recruitment Alternative that can save you a considerable amount of money over the costs charged by traditional head hunters while providing the right fit for the hiring of key management talent. Call us today to discuss your specific needs!<br>

To Whom It May Concern  <br>
<br>
Mr. James Turner, from J. V. Turner and Associates worked on behalf of the three (3) Royal Equator hotel properties to evaluate and provide valuable feedback on proposed changes to the existing Human Resources policies.<br>
<br>
Mr. Turner&#39;s refreshing approach to a proactive strategy aimed at increasing morale and improved employee performance was very much appreciated. Mr. Turner developed policies for Health &amp; Safety and Human Resource management and recruited positions for all three (3) properties. Our company is extremely satisfied with the support and guidance provided and would highly recommend J. V. Turner and Associates to anyone requiring professional guidance in all aspects of Human Resources.  <br>

<br>
Are you getting the greatest possible return <br>
from your most valuable assetyour people?<br>
<br>
Would you invest in a Human Resources Solution<br>
that can help maximize your key talent management.<br>
create bottom line returns and virtually pay for itself?<br>
<br>
Then please take a moment now to discover how we can work together to<br>
maximize the performance of your most valuable resourceyour people.<br>
<br>

In the entrepreneurial spirit, you have built and grown a solid business. You probably started with a good idea, a few key personnel and worked hard to expand your company. <br>
<br>
As your organization grew, you added people and then delegated responsibility for Human Resources management to your office manager, generally a Jack or Jill of all trades. Now however, as you have grown in size, managing your people and getting optimum performance from your team requires professional expertise.<br>
<br>
That is where J &amp; V Turner and Associates can help you and your organization get the results you need from your most vital assets: your people.<br>
<br>
With more than 25 years as senior Human Resources professional and as an HR teacher at McMaster University, I have now dedicated my experience and expertise to working with medium-sized, independent companies like yours to enhance the growth and development of their key talent and maximize the management of their valuable people assets at all levels of the business. <br>
<br>
All I ask for is for a few minutes of your time<br>
and Ill show you how our services will virtually pay for themselves.<br>
<br>
To demonstrate my capabilities and outline how we can save your company time, money and aggravation by maximizing your most powerful and valuable asset  your people -- I would like to meet with you for an hour to review your current Human Resources policies and then provide a written recommendation of how I can help improve your current processes to make your HR management deliver greater returns. <br>
Of course, there is no cost or obligation on your part and all shared information is held in the strictest confidence.<br>

Of course, our key to building successful HR programs for our clients is in identifying and addressing specific areas which need attention and then developing the custom programs which will address the most critical areas of your HR needs.<br>
<br>
I will be calling you in the next week to discuss with you the areas of my services, which are of primary concern for your organization and which I can address in my initial no cost, no-obligation assessment and recommendation.
