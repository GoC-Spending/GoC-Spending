                            Aboriginal Awareness/Cross-Cultural Training, Aboriginal Consultation &amp; Engagement, and Consulting <br>
<br>
Indigenous Corporate Training Inc. provides a range of training and consulting services under our Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples program to organizations interested in building relationships and working more effectively with Aboriginal Peoples. <br>
<br>
ICT recognizes that organizations and their stakeholders are interested in demonstrated results of how training expenditures contribute to the effectiveness of an organization. We show the link between training and performance improvement, which increases organizational effectiveness.  One unique feature of our programs is that they have been developed in collaboration with Aboriginal Peoples and are delivered by competent Aboriginal trainers who themselves are familiar with community, corporate and government operations. <br>
<br>
The programs are competency-based in their design and delivered in a business context. All program content is based in fact, not opinion, and is presented in a professional, non-confrontational manner. Participants are encouraged to ask questions. Interaction is paramount. <br>
<br>
WE WROTE THE BOOK - When it comes to fulfilling our mission we literally wrote the book. Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples is full of unique information designed to increase readers Aboriginal awareness and cross cultural understanding and more importantly take readers a step beyond Aboriginal awareness to practical hints tips and suggestions that can be applied everywhere. <br>
<br>
PUBLIC WORKSHOPS  (www.ictinc.ca or www.workingeffectivelywithaboriginalpeoples.com) <br>
<br>
We have created our own Aboriginal awareness training and Aboriginal cross cultural training workshop titled Working Effectively With Aboriginal Peoples and our latest offering, Aboriginal Consultation &amp; Engagement.<br>
<br>
Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples is a classic Aboriginal cross cultural awareness training program designed to help individuals and organizations work more effectively with Aboriginal Peoples by getting beyond awareness to practical skills that can be applied everywhere. We provide a review of historical events and their relation to the present economic environment; explore critical issues of taxation, housing, and education; learn how working with Aboriginal Peoples can enhance your business; and understand cross-cultural perspectives. <br>
<br>
Our latest offering, Aboriginal Consultation &amp; Engagement gets beyond Aboriginal awareness to practical skills and tools that can be applied during engagement and consultation efforts.  With some tried and proven approached individuals and organizations can position themselves to lead consultation efforts.  The course takes the information learned in our Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples training and provides participants with opportunities to use the information in interactive exercises learning from doing and from others.  We provide the elements of consultation, differential between consultation and engagement, ways to strengthen consultation practices, become familiar with our Risk Assessment Tool, understand TEK, and practice protocol and interactions.<br>
<br>
ON-SITE TRAINING  (www.ictinc.ca)<br>
<br>
Do you have a work team, project team, or group of people that you are working with who could benefit from our Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples or Aboriginal Consultation &amp; Engagement training? Want to get those team members reading from the same book? Then you must consider bringing us in to deliver training at your work site. We have traveled and delivered everywhere from remote offices, churches, residential schools, bars and even a funeral parlor. Wherever your site is we will travel and deliver training to your team in a way that meets their needs. This is a very cost effective and economical solution especially when you have eight or more people that you are thinking of sending to a public workshop. <br>
<br>
ONLINE TRAINING  (www.ictonline.ca)<br>

H. M. Expatriate Resources<br>
<br>
<br>

Indigenous Corporate Training Inc. provides a range of training and consulting services under our Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples program to organizations interested in building relationships and working more effectively with Aboriginal Peoples. <br>
<br>
ICT recognizes that organizations and their stakeholders are interested in demonstrated results of how training expenditures contribute to the effectiveness of an organization. We show the link between training and performance improvement, which increases organizational effectiveness.  One unique feature of our programs is that they have been developed in collaboration with Aboriginal Peoples and are delivered by competent Aboriginal trainers who themselves are familiar with community, corporate and government operations. <br>
<br>
The programs are competency-based in their design and delivered in a business context. All program content is based in fact, not opinion, and is presented in a professional, non-confrontational manner. Participants are encouraged to ask questions. Interaction is paramount. <br>
<br>
WE WROTE THE BOOK - When it comes to fulfilling our mission we literally wrote the book. Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples is full of unique information designed to increase readers Aboriginal awareness and cross cultural understanding and more importantly take readers a step beyond Aboriginal awareness to practical hints tips and suggestions that can be applied everywhere. <br>
<br>
PUBLIC WORKSHOPS  (www.ictinc.ca or www.workingeffectivelywithaboriginalpeoples.com) <br>
<br>
We have created our own Aboriginal awareness training and Aboriginal cross cultural training workshop titled Working Effectively With Aboriginal Peoples and our latest offering, Aboriginal Consultation &amp; Engagement.<br>
<br>
Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples is a classic Aboriginal cross cultural awareness training program designed to help individuals and organizations work more effectively with Aboriginal Peoples by getting beyond awareness to practical skills that can be applied everywhere. We provide a review of historical events and their relation to the present economic environment; explore critical issues of taxation, housing, and education; learn how working with Aboriginal Peoples can enhance your business; and understand cross-cultural perspectives. <br>
<br>
Our latest offering, Aboriginal Consultation &amp; Engagement gets beyond Aboriginal awareness to practical skills and tools that can be applied during engagement and consultation efforts.  With some tried and proven approached individuals and organizations can position themselves to lead consultation efforts.  The course takes the information learned in our Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples training and provides participants with opportunities to use the information in interactive exercises learning from doing and from others.  We provide the elements of consultation, differential between consultation and engagement, ways to strengthen consultation practices, become familiar with our Risk Assessment Tool, understand TEK, and practice protocol and interactions.<br>
<br>
