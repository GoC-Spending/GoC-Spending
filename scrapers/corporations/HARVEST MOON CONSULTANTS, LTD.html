              Facilitation<br>
<br>
&quot;This was an amazing event. I&#39;m not sure how you did what you did; perhaps it&#39;s a lovely combination of wisdom, humour, skill, patience and good faith. It was truly a special gathering.&quot; -- Open Space client<br>
<br>
&quot;Many thanks for your effective and stimulating facilitation. I am now a convert to open space as a very respectful means of community building. You did a great job!&quot; -- Open Space participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Listening to [Chris] is to listen to a man who mostly leads by opening spaces for others to speak. Watching his face in such sessions is to see a lively running interpretation of the speaker, the topic, the discourse, the audience and the &#39;scene.&#39;...Thank you, Chris, for holding open this space for the sacred stories.&quot; -- Phil Cubeta, Philanthropy Blogger and Open Space sponsor<br>
<br>
&quot;You did an excellent job in facilitating the forum and I must extend a special credit to you for keeping it on time - well done.&quot;-- Meeting organizer, Office of the Premier of British Columbia<br>
<br>
&quot;Since our planning session with you, holding the idea of being in a prototyping phase has helped us find ways to say &#39;yes&#39; rather than &#39;no&#39; and we&#39;ve also been freed in not having to get things right. Having solid intention framed by our &#39;burning&#39; question keeps us focused and is central in how we communicate that intention to others. Thank you for helping us build that foundation.&quot;-- Principal of an independant film production company, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a fairly good grasp of facilitation but Chris Corrigan is operating on a completely different plane...what he does is in the realm of magic.&quot; -- Board member of a community economic development group<br>
<br>
&quot;Your skills and integrity and your willingness to stay with the process and the people help a lot. Not an accident that you are seeing wholehearted buy-in and participation. You are willing to hold space for huge amounts of pain and grief, and facilitate not only individual healing, but important changes in community systems and how people work together. You make traditional ritual and practice a real part of meetings in a respectful, integrated way. Open Space works, and Chris works, too--pretty hard, some days.&quot; -- consultant, Everett, Washington<br>
<br>
&quot;David and I were sitting in the peanut gallery as you did your work. I said to him that you really seemed to like what you were doing. The affirmation came when folks were intently talking to one another and were clearly on-task. It was wonderful to see how you built the mood and interaction in the group. Thanks for your work.&quot; -- Conference participant, Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;The work you&#39;re doing is truly amazing. What better than to share hope - and to facilitate and engage the community in carving out their own future.&quot; -- Consultant, Mumbai, India<br>
<br>
&quot;Just wanted to check in and thank you for last night. I still feel warm, optimistic and excited about the energy and ideas in the room -- and looking very forward to looking at the filing cards and big sheets of paper.&quot; -- Sponsor of a World Cafe event, Vancouver.<br>
<br>
&quot;It&#39;s truly remarkable to see how a few hours spent in OS can affect a community...I have seen the parents, staff and students go from hopelessness, despair and anger to action and strength. It seems like somehow everyone suddenly remembered what their true purpose was. They&#39;ve organized action groups, committees, totally revamped the school website, created a very professional proposal and accompanying powerpoint presentation to the school district trustees and best of all, everyone seems to have come together and pooled their energy to really take this school in the direction that we all want. I&#39;m not sure how many of the people who have been actively involved in this work over the past few months would credit that time in OS with having been the turning point for our community... in a way I think that&#39;s a credit to your facilitation, that they see the energy and action as coming together in an organic way from within the group. Regardless, I think that the gift you and Kathryn gave us by holding that space for a few hours and making it possible for us to have true open dialogue together, has been exactly what our school needed to continue existing.&quot; -- Sponsor of an Open Space with an alternative school, North Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to send you my personal thanks for facilitating the youth forum event yesterday. You were a wall of support easing my shaky nerves and your ever-present smile and perfectly chosen words throughout the day always made me feel instantly at ease.&quot; -- Youth forum sponsor, Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the most beautiful agenda I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; -- Appreciative summit client reflecting on the results of a design meeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;We were honored in the way the facilitators, Chris Corrigan and Lyla Brown conducted the meetings. Respective of her traditions, Lyla started each morning with a prayer and then appointing two &#39;Witnesses&#39; to the day&#39;s events, a traditional teaching from the longhouses of her Nation. The Witnesses were to openly listen and remember the day&#39;s work so that in the future, if anyone ever had any questions regarding the event, the Witness could be called upon to retell the activities of the day. In keeping with the oral histories of the Salishan People the Witnesses will carry on in the tradition.&quot; -- Focus Group participant commenting on how we integrated Aboriginal protocol with dialogic facilitation methods<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Lyla and Chris for your amazing work. I haven&#39;t had an experience like the one you gave me ever in this city. It has opened the door for much more to come!&quot; -- Project manager, intergovernmental urban development project<br>
<br>
Training and Learning<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought I was attending this 3-day workshop to learn more about how to use OST in organizations and with clientsbut what I discovered was the deep rich well of possibility that appeared when I opened space inside meinside my own heart, body and mind. It was a much more personal journey than I expected, and what Ive noticed since last week is how many opportunities to open space have arisen, with invitation naturally extended, without me cajoling, coercing or convincing anyone of anything in particular. I am learning that I dont push the river, it really does flow by itself, and that the best I can do is to get into right alignment with it.&quot; -- Professional facilitator, practice reteat participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Chris Corrigan is my OST mentor (he may say differently!). I am learning from him and you and myself as I practice and read and practice OST some more. Chris facilitated a great OST practice workshop a couple of weeks ago where, one more time, I had a rich and rewarding learning experience with and from all those who were there.&quot; -- Facilitator, pracitice workshop participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks for a fantastic workshop. You have a real gift and I&#39;ve definitely come way from this experience with a renewed sense of direction.&quot; -- Public servant, Practice workshop participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Chris is an awesome conversationalist. Every word he says is nuanced by and guided by the Four Practices. I learned more in an hour of conversation with him (including learning about myself) than I have ever learned in a week of intensive study. And the critical content of the conversation is never analysis or argument, but contextual stories.&quot; -- Weblogger and visionary Dave Pollard<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks...for your skill and generosity of Spirit over this week. I have learned tons. I have a glimpse into the potential for opening space and I&#39;m excited to continue the practice.&quot; -- Community organizer, Open Space practice workshop<br>
<br>
&quot;I am just writing you to say thank you. I really enjoyed all of the learning I did with you. I went in to it not thinking that I can really do much to make a difference but I came out of it knowing that I can do so much. You are really inspiring, and for that I appreciate everything you taught me. I hope and pray that everything goes well for you and your family in all the days that come. You have made a difference in my life which is unexplainable. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. You gave it away so freely. I hope that one day that will be me.&quot; -- Aboriginal youth, Open Space practice workshop participant<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been a great addition to my life. I have used the philosophy and principles of OS a few times in places that I would not have expected to and it always amazes me. I am still striving to live in open space and it seems to be a journey well worth the effort.&quot; -- Practice workshop participant, Prince George, BC<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to thank you for an excellent day yesterday...the staff here all really enjoyed the day, and we will definitely benefit from the knowledge and experience you shared.&quot; -- Facilitation workshop participant, Vancouver<br>
<br>
Writing<br>
<br>
&quot;Parking Lot is a dazzling gem which when held in the gaze opens the poetics and practice space&quot; -- Raymon Montalbetti, at if...<br>
<br>
&quot;Still on the subject of Chris Corrigan... he writes so eloquently on the themes of opening space. His blog is a real gift.&quot; -- Johnny Moore<br>
<br>
&quot;As usual, stepping into Chris&#39; blog is never about reading just one post, but getting lost in a lovely sea of facilitation possibility.&quot; -- Nancy White<br>
<br>
Others<br>
<br>
&quot;Just know that I cant think of anybody I would rather have behind me  or in front of me, which seems often to be the case &quot; -- Senior Open Space Technology consultant, Maryland, USA<br>
<br>
&quot;You are such a rare person, full of energy, wide spread interests, ready to listen, to learn, and ready to give, in contact with deep sources.&quot; -- Graphic facilitator, Germany

              Facilitation<br>
<br>
&quot;This was an amazing event. I&#39;m not sure how you did what you did; perhaps it&#39;s a lovely combination of wisdom, humour, skill, patience and good faith. It was truly a special gathering.&quot; -- Open Space client<br>
<br>
&quot;Many thanks for your effective and stimulating facilitation. I am now a convert to open space as a very respectful means of community building. You did a great job!&quot; -- Open Space participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Listening to [Chris] is to listen to a man who mostly leads by opening spaces for others to speak. Watching his face in such sessions is to see a lively running interpretation of the speaker, the topic, the discourse, the audience and the &#39;scene.&#39;...Thank you, Chris, for holding open this space for the sacred stories.&quot; -- Phil Cubeta, Philanthropy Blogger and Open Space sponsor<br>
<br>
&quot;You did an excellent job in facilitating the forum and I must extend a special credit to you for keeping it on time - well done.&quot;-- Meeting organizer, Office of the Premier of British Columbia<br>
<br>
&quot;Since our planning session with you, holding the idea of being in a prototyping phase has helped us find ways to say &#39;yes&#39; rather than &#39;no&#39; and we&#39;ve also been freed in not having to get things right. Having solid intention framed by our &#39;burning&#39; question keeps us focused and is central in how we communicate that intention to others. Thank you for helping us build that foundation.&quot;-- Principal of an independant film production company, Vancouver, BC.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a fairly good grasp of facilitation but Chris Corrigan is operating on a completely different plane...what he does is in the realm of magic.&quot; -- Board member of a community economic development group<br>
<br>
&quot;Your skills and integrity and your willingness to stay with the process and the people help a lot. Not an accident that you are seeing wholehearted buy-in and participation. You are willing to hold space for huge amounts of pain and grief, and facilitate not only individual healing, but important changes in community systems and how people work together. You make traditional ritual and practice a real part of meetings in a respectful, integrated way. Open Space works, and Chris works, too--pretty hard, some days.&quot; -- consultant, Everett, Washington<br>
<br>
&quot;David and I were sitting in the peanut gallery as you did your work. I said to him that you really seemed to like what you were doing. The affirmation came when folks were intently talking to one another and were clearly on-task. It was wonderful to see how you built the mood and interaction in the group. Thanks for your work.&quot; -- Conference participant, Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;The work you&#39;re doing is truly amazing. What better than to share hope - and to facilitate and engage the community in carving out their own future.&quot; -- Consultant, Mumbai, India<br>
<br>
&quot;Just wanted to check in and thank you for last night. I still feel warm, optimistic and excited about the energy and ideas in the room -- and looking very forward to looking at the filing cards and big sheets of paper.&quot; -- Sponsor of a World Cafe event, Vancouver.<br>
<br>
&quot;It&#39;s truly remarkable to see how a few hours spent in OS can affect a community...I have seen the parents, staff and students go from hopelessness, despair and anger to action and strength. It seems like somehow everyone suddenly remembered what their true purpose was. They&#39;ve organized action groups, committees, totally revamped the school website, created a very professional proposal and accompanying powerpoint presentation to the school district trustees and best of all, everyone seems to have come together and pooled their energy to really take this school in the direction that we all want. I&#39;m not sure how many of the people who have been actively involved in this work over the past few months would credit that time in OS with having been the turning point for our community... in a way I think that&#39;s a credit to your facilitation, that they see the energy and action as coming together in an organic way from within the group. Regardless, I think that the gift you and Kathryn gave us by holding that space for a few hours and making it possible for us to have true open dialogue together, has been exactly what our school needed to continue existing.&quot; -- Sponsor of an Open Space with an alternative school, North Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to send you my personal thanks for facilitating the youth forum event yesterday. You were a wall of support easing my shaky nerves and your ever-present smile and perfectly chosen words throughout the day always made me feel instantly at ease.&quot; -- Youth forum sponsor, Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the most beautiful agenda I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; -- Appreciative summit client reflecting on the results of a design meeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;We were honored in the way the facilitators, Chris Corrigan and Lyla Brown conducted the meetings. Respective of her traditions, Lyla started each morning with a prayer and then appointing two &#39;Witnesses&#39; to the day&#39;s events, a traditional teaching from the longhouses of her Nation. The Witnesses were to openly listen and remember the day&#39;s work so that in the future, if anyone ever had any questions regarding the event, the Witness could be called upon to retell the activities of the day. In keeping with the oral histories of the Salishan People the Witnesses will carry on in the tradition.&quot; -- Focus Group participant commenting on how we integrated Aboriginal protocol with dialogic facilitation methods<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Lyla and Chris for your amazing work. I haven&#39;t had an experience like the one you gave me ever in this city. It has opened the door for much more to come!&quot; -- Project manager, intergovernmental urban development project<br>
<br>
Training and Learning<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought I was attending this 3-day workshop to learn more about how to use OST in organizations and with clientsbut what I discovered was the deep rich well of possibility that appeared when I opened space inside meinside my own heart, body and mind. It was a much more personal journey than I expected, and what Ive noticed since last week is how many opportunities to open space have arisen, with invitation naturally extended, without me cajoling, coercing or convincing anyone of anything in particular. I am learning that I dont push the river, it really does flow by itself, and that the best I can do is to get into right alignment with it.&quot; -- Professional facilitator, practice reteat participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Chris Corrigan is my OST mentor (he may say differently!). I am learning from him and you and myself as I practice and read and practice OST some more. Chris facilitated a great OST practice workshop a couple of weeks ago where, one more time, I had a rich and rewarding learning experience with and from all those who were there.&quot; -- Facilitator, pracitice workshop participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks for a fantastic workshop. You have a real gift and I&#39;ve definitely come way from this experience with a renewed sense of direction.&quot; -- Public servant, Practice workshop participant<br>
<br>
&quot;Chris is an awesome conversationalist. Every word he says is nuanced by and guided by the Four Practices. I learned more in an hour of conversation with him (including learning about myself) than I have ever learned in a week of intensive study. And the critical content of the conversation is never analysis or argument, but contextual stories.&quot; -- Weblogger and visionary Dave Pollard<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks...for your skill and generosity of Spirit over this week. I have learned tons. I have a glimpse into the potential for opening space and I&#39;m excited to continue the practice.&quot; -- Community organizer, Open Space practice workshop<br>
<br>
&quot;I am just writing you to say thank you. I really enjoyed all of the learning I did with you. I went in to it not thinking that I can really do much to make a difference but I came out of it knowing that I can do so much. You are really inspiring, and for that I appreciate everything you taught me. I hope and pray that everything goes well for you and your family in all the days that come. You have made a difference in my life which is unexplainable. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. You gave it away so freely. I hope that one day that will be me.&quot; -- Aboriginal youth, Open Space practice workshop participant<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been a great addition to my life. I have used the philosophy and principles of OS a few times in places that I would not have expected to and it always amazes me. I am still striving to live in open space and it seems to be a journey well worth the effort.&quot; -- Practice workshop participant, Prince George, BC<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to thank you for an excellent day yesterday...the staff here all really enjoyed the day, and we will definitely benefit from the knowledge and experience you shared.&quot; -- Facilitation workshop participant, Vancouver<br>
<br>
Writing<br>
<br>
&quot;Parking Lot is a dazzling gem which when held in the gaze opens the poetics and practice space&quot; -- Raymon Montalbetti, at if...<br>
<br>
&quot;Still on the subject of Chris Corrigan... he writes so eloquently on the themes of opening space. His blog is a real gift.&quot; -- Johnny Moore<br>
<br>
&quot;As usual, stepping into Chris&#39; blog is never about reading just one post, but getting lost in a lovely sea of facilitation possibility.&quot; -- Nancy White<br>
<br>
Others<br>
<br>
&quot;Just know that I cant think of anybody I would rather have behind me  or in front of me, which seems often to be the case &quot; -- Senior Open Space Technology consultant, Maryland, USA<br>
<br>
&quot;You are such a rare person, full of energy, wide spread interests, ready to listen, to learn, and ready to give, in contact with deep sources.&quot; -- Graphic facilitator, Germany
