                            CUSTOM DESIGNED CASES FROM CUSTOM CASE COMPANY<br>
<br>
Custom designed cases are the answer to your packaging <br>
requirements when you have equipment that is too large to be <br>
contained in a molded case, you have a number of items that you <br>
want to place in individual compartments or you want the <br>
flexibility to adapt your case to fit other items in the future. <br>
There are also a greater number of options available with this <br>
style of case. <br>
<br>
Our cases are custom built to meet your requirements and can be <br>
manufactured in a larger range of sizes. There is no minimum <br>
order quantity. When you choose a Custom Case there is no <br>
fitting, cutting or resizing of loose pieces of foam to be done <br>
before you can use it. When you receive your Custom Case all you <br>
need to do is load it and go.<br>

 9430IR Infrared Remote Area Lighting System<br>
MAINTAIN STEALTH/NEUTRALIZE THREAT<br>
Pelican&#39;s new 9430IR (infrared) spotlight reaches down-range to provide situational awareness without compromising stealth. 24 infrared lamp modules generate light visible only to forces equipped with night vision equipment. Capable of operating 75 yards out, the 9430IR extends the tactical advantage of night vision technology.<br>
<br>
Covert Checkpoint: Now soldiers can establish covert NV checkpoints to asses threats and provide advance warning to exposed personnel.<br>
<br>
Perimeter Security: The 9430IR can be hand carried to remote locations. Equipped with night vision and digital communication, forces outside the perimeter can remain invisible and silent while using the 9430IR to report enemy movement. <br>

9500 Shelter Lighting System  <br>
<br>
 9500 Shelter Lighting System<br>
The 9500 Shelter Lighting System will be the latest addition to the RALS family of lighting solutions. It provides soldiers with safe, secure and silent LED interior shelter lighting in either white or red light. The system is extremely rugged and deploys quickly. It contains three red/white LED light heads, universal power supply, inline switch, fixing straps and a series of color coded industrial grade connecting cables. Light heads are linked together and secured via hanging straps inside the temporary shelter/accommodation. The light output color (red or white) is selected via an inline switch and each light head can be independently switched on or off. The system is powered by the enclosed universal AC power supply or by an auxiliary 12-30 vdc power source such as the 9430 or 9460.<br>

              &quot;I just want to say thank you for such great service. The case I ordered Tuesday afternoon, was delivered to the door this morning, in lots of time for Christmas! This was after I&#39;d wasted more than one day driving around Thunder Bay trying to find a local supplier. I&#39;ve got to make the switch to on-line shopping! Thanks again, and Seasons Greetings&quot; Wendy.<br>

&quot;I recieved the Pelican case for the Sony camera and it fits GREAT! I must admit I had my doubt about my tracing and dimensions and how accurate they would be. The camera fits very snug but does not have to be forced in. GREAT JOB!&quot; Tedd<br>

&quot;Wow you people are fast! The case arrived Tuesday morning. It&#39;s absolutely PERFECT. Great job by all involved with an incredibly professional looking product. Pleasure doing business with you&quot;. Margaret<br>

&quot;Just a little note to tell you I didn&#39;t have time to check the tracking of my package....It arrived this morning at 10am! I have seen fast, but that is VERY fast! Thanks again, all items are great. Will strongly recommend your company to my fellows in the beautiful film industry.

&quot;Hello I am Ryan Sargent I recently bought a Pelican 1200 case from you and it&#39;s great. I received it only 3 days after ordering it and the price was great compared to others. Right now I have a Garmen GPS unit in it and a pair of Motorola hand radios. The case is perfect for these, love it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

&quot;I got the 1750 Pelican case today and love it and the free light works great. Thanks for your help.My friend is considering buying a handgun after Christmas and I will highly recommend he buy a Pelican case for his new purchase from you. It is hard to find true customer service these days and your lighting fast response and quote was great. I just received a quote today form another company for $250.00 and I requested all the quotes the same day. Well thank you for your help it was a pleasure doing business with you. &quot; Joseph Johnson<br>

&quot; Thank you for your prompt reply and your good advice. Apparently the Australian agency has been changed (could it have been because of poor service to customers????) and when I contacted the new agent, he immediately organized the posting of the replacement catches. He is also organizing one their reps to contact me with current prices etc.So all has moved in the right direction thanks to you. Best regards,&quot; (Ted Jones)<br>

&quot; Last week, I purchased a Pelican Travel Vault from Larry based on information from your website.

Thank you for such a pleasant business transaction.&quot; (Bryan Tucker)<br>

&quot; The custom cases for the 4240 electronic signs arrived today. They look good and the equipment fits like a glove. The locking hasp, the hinge stops, the hand access slot, the extra wide wheelbase, and the sturdy construction are all nice touches that were unexpected. The cases are perfect. Thank you.&quot;(C.Rock)<br>

                            CUSTOM DESIGNED CASES FROM CUSTOM CASE COMPANY<br>
<br>
Custom designed cases are the answer to your packaging <br>
requirements when you have equipment that is too large to be <br>
contained in a molded case, you have a number of items that you <br>
want to place in individual compartments or you want the <br>
flexibility to adapt your case to fit other items in the future. <br>
There are also a greater number of options available with this <br>
style of case. <br>
<br>
Our cases are custom built to meet your requirements and can be <br>
manufactured in a larger range of sizes. There is no minimum <br>
order quantity. When you choose a Custom Case there is no <br>
fitting, cutting or resizing of loose pieces of foam to be done <br>
before you can use it. When you receive your Custom Case all you <br>
need to do is load it and go.<br>

9500 Shelter Lighting System  <br>
<br>
 9500 Shelter Lighting System<br>
The 9500 Shelter Lighting System will be the latest addition to the RALS family of lighting solutions. It provides soldiers with safe, secure and silent LED interior shelter lighting in either white or red light. The system is extremely rugged and deploys quickly. It contains three red/white LED light heads, universal power supply, inline switch, fixing straps and a series of color coded industrial grade connecting cables. Light heads are linked together and secured via hanging straps inside the temporary shelter/accommodation. The light output color (red or white) is selected via an inline switch and each light head can be independently switched on or off. The system is powered by the enclosed universal AC power supply or by an auxiliary 12-30 vdc power source such as the 9430 or 9460.<br>

              &quot;I just want to say thank you for such great service. The case I ordered Tuesday afternoon, was delivered to the door this morning, in lots of time for Christmas! This was after I&#39;d wasted more than one day driving around Thunder Bay trying to find a local supplier. I&#39;ve got to make the switch to on-line shopping! Thanks again, and Seasons Greetings&quot; Wendy.<br>

&quot;I recieved the Pelican case for the Sony camera and it fits GREAT! I must admit I had my doubt about my tracing and dimensions and how accurate they would be. The camera fits very snug but does not have to be forced in. GREAT JOB!&quot; Tedd<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow you people are fast! The case arrived Tuesday morning. It&#39;s absolutely PERFECT. Great job by all involved with an incredibly professional looking product. Pleasure doing business with you&quot;. Margaret<br>

<br>
&quot;Just a little note to tell you I didn&#39;t have time to check the tracking of my package....It arrived this morning at 10am! I have seen fast, but that is VERY fast! Thanks again, all items are great. Will strongly recommend your company to my fellows in the beautiful film industry. The fastest service I have seen yet from any company in Canada..First time customer but surely not the last time! And the prices are right! Thank you ! &quot; F.Chanmberland<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello I am Ryan Sargent I recently bought a Pelican 1200 case from you and it&#39;s great. I received it only 3 days after ordering it and the price was great compared to others. Right now I have a Garmen GPS unit in it and a pair of Motorola hand radios. The case is perfect for these, love it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I got the 1750 Pelican case today and love it and the free light works great. Thanks for your help.My friend is considering buying a handgun after Christmas and I will highly recommend he buy a Pelican case for his new purchase from you. It is hard to find true customer service these days and your lighting fast response and quote was great. I just received a quote today form another company for $250.00 and I requested all the quotes the same day. Well thank you for your help it was a pleasure doing business with you. &quot; Joseph Johnson<br>
<br>
<br>

&quot; Thank you for your prompt reply and your good advice. Apparently the Australian agency has been changed (could it have been because of poor service to customers????) and when I contacted the new agent, he immediately organized the posting of the replacement catches. He is also organizing one their reps to contact me with current prices etc.So all has moved in the right direction thanks to you. Best regards,&quot; (Ted Jones)<br>

&quot; Last week, I purchased a Pelican Travel Vault from Larry based on information from your website. Your company had very competitive prices and I was pleased to see that you also have excellent customer service. My case arrived at my door only four days after I called in the order. Thank you for such a pleasant business transaction.&quot; (Bryan Tucker)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; The custom cases for the 4240 electronic signs arrived today. They look good and the equipment fits like a glove. The locking hasp, the hinge stops, the hand access slot, the extra wide wheelbase, and the sturdy construction are all nice touches that were unexpected. The cases are perfect. Thank you.&quot;(C.Rock)<br>
<br>
&quot; The crates arrived and they are absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much for<br>
your work and craftsmanship.&quot; (T. Legari) <br>

<br>
<br>
&quot; Thank you for the follow up. The guys are really happy with the new case.&quot; ( F. Costa )<br>
