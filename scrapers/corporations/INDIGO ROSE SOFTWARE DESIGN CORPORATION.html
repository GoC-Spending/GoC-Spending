                            AutoPlay Media Studio 8 is a software development tool that gives software developers and programmers the ability to create full-featured interactive Windows multimedia software applications using a visual drag-and-drop development environment. What would take weeks to build using traditional software development tools (C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, Delphi) can now be created rapidly by anyone. Use it to create database and internet applications, autorun cd/dvd/usb/blu-ray interfaces, multimedia software and much more.<br>
<br>
AutoPlay Media Studio&#39;s visual rapid application development environment makes software programming faster and eases the software development process. Build multimedia software, business software and application software for use on Windows 7, Vista and XP. Drag and drop technology reduces your software testing and software prototyping burden and increases software quality. Agile software development is easier with AutoPlay Studio&#39;s rapid application development environment!<br>
<br>
Simply drop your videos, images, Flash, HTML, music, text and document files onto Autoplay Media Studio&#39;s pages and dialogs and move them into position using your mouse. Once you&#39;ve created the visual interface, adding in powerful interactivity is a snap. With the Action Wizard, all it takes is a few clicks and a fill-in-the-blanks form. With over 865 high-level actions to choose from, like XML parsing, sending email, running applications, downloading files, browsing web sites, video playback and multi-channel audio mixing, you can develop anything you can think of.<br>
<br>
The new Lua 5.1 programming language scripting engine opens up limitless possibilities. With full syntax highlighting, code completion, functions and control structures, it&#39;s an exceptionally flexible system. It&#39;s the perfect software development tool for software developers, network administrators, programmers, consultants, ISV&#39;s or anyone creating software or doing software development for Windows.<br>

It&#39;s just that easy.<br>
<br>

                            DeltaMAX is an advanced binary differencing engine library for Windows. It is capable of analyzing two files and storing only the byte level differences between them. What makes DeltaMAX exceptional is its ability to handle very large files (up to 2GB) and to encode files very quickly. Incorporate state-of-the-art file differencing into your own software applications, at a fraction of the cost of developing the technology yourself. Ideal for use in backup software, server synchronization, data transmission or wherever the environment calls for reduced storage space and lower bandwidth usage.<br>
<br>
DeltaMAX features extremely fast proprietary encoding algorithms and custom I/O routines that allow it to run circles around other tools. In benchmark testing, DeltaMAX was able to create a patch for a 1.2 GB data file in under 3 minutes, whereas the nearest competitor we tested required more than 70 minutes.<br>
<br>
Some of the competing libraries we tested were not even able to process such a large file, and either failed completely or were still processing after more than 24 hours. DeltaMAX is simply in another league altogether.<br>
Written in 100% hand optimized C++ code, the DeltaMAX DLL is compact and easy to deploy. It can be seamlessly incorporated into your software product using either traditional direct DLL calls or from any language that supports COM/ActiveX controls.<br>
<br>
Use it with virtually any Windows development language including C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Delphi, .NET, Visual Studio and more. We even include sample code and projects written in Visual C++, Visual Basic, VB.NET and C# .NET to get you started.<br>
<br>
What makes DeltaMAX exceptional is its ability to handle very large files (up to 2GB) and to encode files very quickly. The DeltaMAX engine provides significant performance gains over older technology. In our test suite, it was able to delta compress a 120 MB video game texture data file by 99.6% in only 9.05 seconds.<br>
<br>
In comparison, a competitive technology required over 25 minutes to achieve a compression ratio of only 18.7%. Incorporating the DeltaMAX engine into your software application will give you a distinct competitive advantage.<br>
Binary differencing is the process of analyzing two files and then compactly representing the differences or delta between them. DeltaMAXs proprietary encoding algorithm creates remarkably compact difference files. Compression ratios can be as dramatic as 99% or more.<br>
<br>
Additionally, due to DeltaMAXs impressive encoding speed, it can perform additional size optimizations that are not feasible with other tools. Multi-pass optimization performs multiple encoding passes in order to achieve the best results possible.<br>

                            AutoPlay Media Studio 8 is a software development tool that gives software developers and programmers the ability to create full-featured interactive Windows multimedia software applications using a visual drag-and-drop development environment. What would take weeks to build using traditional software development tools (C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, Delphi) can now be created rapidly by anyone. Use it to create database and internet applications, autorun cd/dvd/usb/blu-ray interfaces, multimedia software and much more.<br>
<br>
AutoPlay Media Studio&#39;s visual rapid application development environment makes software programming faster and eases the software development process. Build multimedia software, business software and application software for use on Windows 7, Vista and XP. Drag and drop technology reduces your software testing and software prototyping burden and increases software quality. Agile software development is easier with AutoPlay Studio&#39;s rapid application development environment!<br>
<br>
Simply drop your videos, images, Flash, HTML, music, text and document files onto Autoplay Media Studio&#39;s pages and dialogs and move them into position using your mouse. Once you&#39;ve created the visual interface, adding in powerful interactivity is a snap. With the Action Wizard, all it takes is a few clicks and a fill-in-the-blanks form. With over 865 high-level actions to choose from, like XML parsing, sending email, running applications, downloading files, browsing web sites, video playback and multi-channel audio mixing, you can develop anything you can think of.<br>
<br>
The new Lua 5.1 programming language scripting engine opens up limitless possibilities. With full syntax highlighting, code completion, functions and control structures, it&#39;s an exceptionally flexible system. It&#39;s the perfect software development tool for software developers, network administrators, programmers, consultants, ISV&#39;s or anyone creating software or doing software development for Windows.<br>

                            DeltaMAX is an advanced binary differencing engine library for Windows. It is capable of analyzing two files and storing only the byte level differences between them. What makes DeltaMAX exceptional is its ability to handle very large files (up to 2GB) and to encode files very quickly. Incorporate state-of-the-art file differencing into your own software applications, at a fraction of the cost of developing the technology yourself. Ideal for use in backup software, server synchronization, data transmission or wherever the environment calls for reduced storage space and lower bandwidth usage.<br>
<br>
DeltaMAX features extremely fast proprietary encoding algorithms and custom I/O routines that allow it to run circles around other tools. In benchmark testing, DeltaMAX was able to create a patch for a 1.2 GB data file in under 3 minutes, whereas the nearest competitor we tested required more than 70 minutes.<br>
<br>
Some of the competing libraries we tested were not even able to process such a large file, and either failed completely or were still processing after more than 24 hours. DeltaMAX is simply in another league altogether.<br>
Written in 100% hand optimized C++ code, the DeltaMAX DLL is compact and easy to deploy. It can be seamlessly incorporated into your software product using either traditional direct DLL calls or from any language that supports COM/ActiveX controls.<br>
<br>
Use it with virtually any Windows development language including C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Delphi, .NET, Visual Studio and more. We even include sample code and projects written in Visual C++, Visual Basic, VB.NET and C# .NET to get you started.<br>
<br>
What makes DeltaMAX exceptional is its ability to handle very large files (up to 2GB) and to encode files very quickly. The DeltaMAX engine provides significant performance gains over older technology. In our test suite, it was able to delta compress a 120 MB video game texture data file by 99.6% in only 9.05 seconds.<br>
<br>
In comparison, a competitive technology required over 25 minutes to achieve a compression ratio of only 18.7%. Incorporating the DeltaMAX engine into your software application will give you a distinct competitive advantage.<br>
Binary differencing is the process of analyzing two files and then compactly representing the differences or delta between them. DeltaMAXs proprietary encoding algorithm creates remarkably compact difference files. Compression ratios can be as dramatic as 99% or more.<br>
<br>
Additionally, due to DeltaMAXs impressive encoding speed, it can perform additional size optimizations that are not feasible with other tools. Multi-pass optimization performs multiple encoding passes in order to achieve the best results possible.<br>
