        <br>            independent internal potable water containment and distribution systems for residential and commercial applications<br><br>Safe Drinking Water-Distribution System: The Next Frontier<br><br>waterlocker Inc.<br><br>A local entrepreneur has developed a concept related to residential and commercial potable water distribution, which addresses many levels of concern of all individuals and government.  In Canada the safety of drinking water supplies is a responsibility that is shared between the provincial/territorial, federal, and municipal governments, all of which their number one priority is the health and well being of individuals.  Currently waterlocker inc. is in the early stages of development focusing primarily on safe drinking water distribution within the province of Nova Scotia with the goal of leading the way towards a more effective and efficient drinking water management system and supply, while building a viable, sustainable industry at the same time.<br><br>As we all are becoming more educated and aware of the dangers of ground water pollution and health risks associated with lead, chlorine, pesticides, organic chemicals, arsenic, uranium, and various micro-organisms that have been found to contaminate public water supplies.  Outbreaks of water borne diseases are becoming a common occurrence and have affected entire city populations, leading to serious health complications and even fatalities.<br><br>As a consequence many people must resort to acquiring their own potable drinking water through commercial sources; typically in the form of bottled water.  Whether the bottled water is purchased in a personal sized container or in a five gallon jug there are numerous drawbacks associated. <br><br>Excessive use of personal sized water bottles can become expensive, not to mention the tremendous burden on the environment and the long term impact of this waste accumulation is unknown. As well the actual quality and safety of the product itself can be doubtful.<br><br>With respect to larger containers such as a five gallon jug it is widely accepted that the weight of a full bottle (approx 42lbs) is difficult to handle and makes it near impossible for some people to replenish the water in a water cooler. <br><br> The objectives and advantages of waterlocker inc. include providing a controlled system for storage and distribution of a constant abundant supply of clean safe drinking water at each residential or commercial application.  The distribution system involved will eliminate health risks and costs associated with tainted, contaminated, or poor drinking water sources including risks associated with drinking water being transferred through faulty, aged, or improper pipe distribution systems.  The entire distribution system is environmentally friendly, in that there are no disposable containers involved with the process; eliminating the need for handling bulky, heavy, awkward water jugs and bottles.<br><br>waterlocker inc. will eliminate the need for expensive water conditioning, purifying and filtration systems which primarily improve taste, appearance, and eliminate odor but do not necessarily make the water safe to drink. <br><br>waterlocker inc. requires virtually no maintenance to ensure an abundant supply of clean safe drinking water and greatly reduces waste of this critical resource by means of monitoring and control features. <br><br>Future modifications which will be incorporated into the waterlocker system will allow for greater convenience and flexibility within each application. <br><br>It is much easier and cost effective to manage a resource if government, businesses, communities and individuals work toward common goals.<br>

                            independent internal potable water containment and distrSafe Drinking Water-Distribution System: The Next Frontier<br>
waterlocker Inc.<br>
<br>
A local entrepreneur has developed a concept related to residential and commercial potable water distribution, which addresses many levels of concern of all individuals and government.  In Canada the safety of drinking water supplies is a responsibility that is shared between the provincial/territorial, federal, and municipal governments, all of which their number one priority is the health and well being of individuals.  Currently waterlocker inc. is in the early stages of development focusing primarily on safe drinking water distribution within the province of Nova Scotia with the goal of leading the way towards a more effective and efficient drinking water management system and supply, while building a viable, sustainable industry at the same time.<br>
<br>
As we all are becoming more educated and aware of the dangers of ground water pollution and health risks associated with lead, chlorine, pesticides, organic chemicals, arsenic, uranium, and various micro-organisms that have been found to contaminate public water supplies.  Outbreaks of water borne diseases are becoming a common occurrence and have affected entire city populations, leading to serious health complications and even fatalities.<br>
<br>
As a consequence many people must resort to acquiring their own potable drinking water through commercial sources; typically in the form of bottled water.  Whether the bottled water is purchased in a personal sized container or in a five gallon jug there are numerous drawbacks associated .<br>
<br>
Excessive use of personal sized water bottles can become expensive, not to mention the tremendous burden on the environment and the long term impact of this waste accumulation is unknown. As well the actual quality and safety of the product itself can be doubtful.<br>
<br>
With respect to larger containers such as a five gallon jug it is widely accepted that the weight of a full bottle (approx 42lbs) is difficult to handle and makes it near impossible for some people to replenish the water in a water cooler.<br>
<br>
 The objectives and advantages of waterlocker inc. include providing a controlled system for storage and distribution of a constant abundant supply of clean safe drinking water at each residential or commercial application.  The distribution system involved will eliminate health risks and costs associated with tainted, contaminated, or poor drinking water sources including risks associated with drinking water being transferred through faulty, aged, or improper pipe distribution systems.  The entire distribution system is environmentally friendly, in that there are no disposable containers involved with the process; eliminating the need for handling bulky, heavy, awkward water jugs and bottles.<br>
<br>
waterlocker inc. will eliminate the need for expensive water conditioning, purifying and filtration systems which primarily improve taste, appearance, and eliminate odor but do not necessarily make the water safe to drink.<br>
<br>
waterlocker inc. requires virtually no maintenance to ensure an abundant supply of clean safe drinking water and greatly reduces waste of this critical resource by means of monitoring and control features.<br>
<br>
Future modifications which will be incorporated into the waterlocker system will allow for greater convenience and flexibility within each application.  <br>
<br>
It is much easier and cost effective to manage a resource if government, businesses, communities and individuals work toward common goals.<br>
<br>
waterlocker inc.<br>
Mission: To make available and provide safe, clean, worry-free drinking water to all individuals.<br>
<br>
“As the province of Nova Scotia has a clear commitment to clean water which is the single most important environmental issue”.   <br>
“(Drinking water strategies Nova Scotia 2002)”.<br>
waterlocker inc. is confident that the Government of Nova Scotia will play an active part and support the company’s development and growth.<br>
<br>
Currently at least 46% of Nova Scotians rely on ground water from dug or drilled well (more than 107,000 province wide). The remaining 54 % receive treated water from ground water or surface operated by municipal water utilities, which although treated at source; the end result after traveling through pipe systems is questionable in many circumstances.  Purchasing safe water is more effective than attempting to treat poor quality source water.<br>
<br>
As Nova Scotia continues to grow and prosper more pressures are constantly being placed on our water sources.  The more regulations that are implemented on this industry to ensure the quality of drinking water from source to the end user the healthier we will be.  It is vital that we all do our part to ensure that one of our most critical resources is protected and managed effectively to be sustainable for future generations.  Drinking water systems must protect public health and conserve resource.<br>
<br>
Throughout the world there is a shift in attitudes and knowledge from:<br>
               safe drinking water safe is an inherent right <br>
                            to <br>
              safe drinking water is a valuable limited resource which must be managed properly to ensure sustainability.<br>
<br>
“(GPI Atlantic 2000)”<br>
“1/3 of Nova Scotians do not trust their drinking water”.<br>
<br>
“  During a time of budget restraints we need to keep in mind the necessary investments to maintain our water resources and learn from history that the costs of inadequate monitoring and enforcement of drinking water quality and disinvestment in environment protection produces major costs to society and the economy.”<br>
<br>
“Drinking water safety is different from general pollution abatement in a number of important respects.  First the public health and safety concerns arising from unsafe drinking water are acute and immediate.  If water is contaminated, people get sick or die.  As a result the system must focus on avoiding problems in the first place and taking swift corrective action when deficiencies are identified.”  <br>
“(Commissioner O’conner, Walkerton Inquiry)”<br>

Executive Summary<br>
   Every Province in Canada has its own unique challenges with current supplies of safe drinking water, and the urgency to find alternative methods of supply is the number one concern of all levels of government in Canada. waterlocker addresses these concerns by offering and making available to all individuals a secure, convenient, affordable means of maintaining an abundant supply of safe drinking water within each application. The waterlocker basic unit has a capacity to contain and distribute enough safe drinking water to sustain a family of four for three to four months between refills, with the capability to connect as many units as required for larger applications. waterlocker incorporates a management control system that monitors the exact amounts of potable water being distributed within each market area and to each application.  Our water supply is at a crucial stage where we must begin to manage and regulate this critical resource immediately and effectively in order to sustain its availability for future generations.  <br>

<br>
 Industry<br>
waterlocker Inc. is best described as a new level of distribution of potable water to residential and commercial applications.  The Industry as it stands does not offer this level of customer convenience and safety insofar as the sources currently marketing “drinking water”.  The market potential is unlimited as potable water is a critical requirement for all individuals.  According to surveys conducted throughout Canada in 2001 clearly 1/3 of Canadians did not trust their drinking water and must resort to purchasing bottled water as the next best alternative available; even though the quality and safety of bottled water may be questionable.  As well there is much concern regarding the environmental impact of disposable plastic bottles, not to mention the safety of the materials used in the manufacturing of these bottles.  The annual sales of bottled water in Canada is known to be in the billions of dollars; however an exact figure is difficult to ascertain based on available information. Several events have occurred that certainly elevate the number of individuals seeking alternatives for safe water, such as contamination events in Walkerton, North Battleford, and Kashechewan; as well the fact that on any given day there are usually 1000+ boil orders in effect across the country.  Our government estimates that 90,000 illnesses and 900 deaths occur in Canada annually due to contaminated drinking water, and independent health experts suggest a much higher number of Canadians suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses related to poor quality drinking water.   <br>

Market Analysis<br>
“As the province of Nova Scotia has a clear commitment to clean water which is the single most important environmental issue”.   “(Drinking water strategies Nova Scotia 2002)”.<br>
waterlocker Inc. is confident that the Government of Nova Scotia will play an active part and support the company’s development and growth.<br>
Currently at least 46% of Nova Scotians rely on ground water from dug or drilled well (more than 107,000 province wide). The remaining 54 % receive treated water from ground water or surface operated by municipal water utilities, which although treated at source; the end result after traveling through pipe systems is questionable in many circumstances.  Purchasing safe water is more effective than attempting to treat poor quality source water.<br>
As Nova Scotia continues to grow and prosper more pressures are constantly being placed on our water sources.  The more regulations that are implemented on this industry to ensure the quality of drinking water from source to the end user the healthier we will be.  It is vital that we all do our part to ensure that one of our most critical resources is protected and managed effectively to be sustainable for future generations.  Drinking water systems must protect public health and conserve resource.<br>
Throughout the world there is a shift in attitudes and knowledge from:<br>
 safe drinking water safe is an inherent right to safe drinking water is a valuable limited resource which must be managed properly to ensure sustainability.<br>
<br>
“(GPI Atlantic 2000)”<br>
“1/3 of Nova Scotians do not trust their drinking water”.<br>
<br>
“ During a time of budget restraints we need to keep in mind the necessary investments to maintain our water resources and learn from history that the costs of inadequate monitoring and enforcement of drinking water quality and disinvestment in environment protection produces major costs to society and the economy.”<br>
<br>
Target Market<br>
                                              waterlocker Inc.<br>
 <br>
<br>
                                  <br>
 The Company will comprise of several levels of production; distribution; service and sales activities.<br>
<br>
The primary focus of the company is to manufacture and distribute containment units (waterlocker tm); which will be constructed of a drinking water safe material. These units will be installed in residential and commercial applications by the company and will act as a holding tank for clean safe drinking water, which will be delivered to the application by tanker trucks specifically equipped by waterlocker Inc. to maintain the integrity of  contents; which will in turn be distributed throughout the application by means of the (waterlocker tm system) which incorporates a series of piping and fittings designed to allow the water to transfer to the end receptacle ie: (waterlocker tm dispenser)basic system<br>
First year projections are based on the company’s ability to manufacture and install approximately 13,000 (waterlocker tm) units, which represents less than 2% of the available market share potential in Nova Scotia. The first year amount of drinking water delivered will be approximately 50,000,000 liters, which again represents less than 2% of the available market share potential in Nova Scotia.<br>
The employment requirements are immediate and would include complete operations of a plastics plant capable of manufacturing the required number of (waterlocker tm) units. Also 15 installation technicians/ 15 water delivery representatives would be needed immediately to commence business objectives.<br>

Product [Prototype] Description and Product Advantage<br>
<br>
The present invention provides a drinking water distribution system purposed to store and then distribute potable drinking water throughout residential and/or commercial buildings for various applications. In particular the drinking water distribution system comprises a storage tank, hoses, and/or pipes fittingly connected to the storage tank that are deployed throughout a building, and at least one end unit, such as a water dispenser or a water cooler for example. Preferably the end unit has means to quickly connect or disconnect to the hose and/or pipe to access the storage tank. A more detailed description of total system configuration as outlined in Patent.<br>

Containment unit is designed to resemble a common rectangular gym locker in appearance. One of the unique features is the ability to connect as many waterlocker units as required for larger applications. This is achieved by removing a knockout plug located at bottom section of tank and joining to another tank by means of a fitting specifically designed for this purpose. This connector is threaded in the same direction on both sides of center nut and when tightened draws the two units together to form a watertight union. As many units as required/desired may be connected using this method, and is only limited by the available space in each application.<br>

                            independent internal potable water containment and distrSafe Drinking Water-Distribution System: The Next Frontier<br>
waterlocker Inc.<br>
<br>
A local entrepreneur has developed a concept related to residential and commercial potable water distribution, which addresses many levels of concern of all individuals and government.  In Canada the safety of drinking water supplies is a responsibility that is shared between the provincial/territorial, federal, and municipal governments, all of which their number one priority is the health and well being of individuals.  Currently waterlocker inc. is in the early stages of development focusing primarily on safe drinking water distribution within the province of Nova Scotia with the goal of leading the way towards a more effective and efficient drinking water management system and supply, while building a viable, sustainable industry at the same time.<br>
<br>
As we all are becoming more educated and aware of the dangers of ground water pollution and health risks associated with lead, chlorine, pesticides, organic chemicals, arsenic, uranium, and various micro-organisms that have been found to contaminate public water supplies.  Outbreaks of water borne diseases are becoming a common occurrence and have affected entire city populations, leading to serious health complications and even fatalities.<br>
<br>
As a consequence many people must resort to acquiring their own potable drinking water through commercial sources; typically in the form of bottled water.  Whether the bottled water is purchased in a personal sized container or in a five gallon jug there are numerous drawbacks associated .<br>
<br>
Excessive use of personal sized water bottles can become expensive, not to mention the tremendous burden on the environment and the long term impact of this waste accumulation is unknown. As well the actual quality and safety of the product itself can be doubtful.<br>
<br>
With respect to larger containers such as a five gallon jug it is widely accepted that the weight of a full bottle (approx 42lbs) is difficult to handle and makes it near impossible for some people to replenish the water in a water cooler.<br>
<br>
 The objectives and advantages of waterlocker inc. include providing a controlled system for storage and distribution of a constant abundant supply of clean safe drinking water at each residential or commercial application.  The distribution system involved will eliminate health risks and costs associated with tainted, contaminated, or poor drinking water sources including risks associated with drinking water being transferred through faulty, aged, or improper pipe distribution systems.  The entire distribution system is environmentally friendly, in that there are no disposable containers involved with the process; eliminating the need for handling bulky, heavy, awkward water jugs and bottles.<br>
<br>
waterlocker inc. will eliminate the need for expensive water conditioning, purifying and filtration systems which primarily improve taste, appearance, and eliminate odor but do not necessarily make the water safe to drink.<br>
<br>
waterlocker inc. requires virtually no maintenance to ensure an abundant supply of clean safe drinking water and greatly reduces waste of this critical resource by means of monitoring and control features.<br>
<br>
Future modifications which will be incorporated into the waterlocker system will allow for greater convenience and flexibility within each application.  <br>
<br>
It is much easier and cost effective to manage a resource if government, businesses, communities and individuals work toward common goals.<br>

Mission: To make available and provide safe, clean, worry-free drinking water to all individuals.<br>
<br>
“As the province of Nova Scotia has a clear commitment to clean water which is the single most important environmental issue”.   <br>
“(Drinking water strategies Nova Scotia 2002)”.<br>
waterlocker inc. is confident that the Government of Nova Scotia will play an active part and support the company’s development and growth.<br>
<br>
Currently at least 46% of Nova Scotians rely on ground water from dug or drilled well (more than 107,000 province wide). The remaining 54 % receive treated water from ground water or surface operated by municipal water utilities, which although treated at source; the end result after traveling through pipe systems is questionable in many circumstances.  Purchasing safe water is more effective than attempting to treat poor quality source water.<br>
<br>
As Nova Scotia continues to grow and prosper more pressures are constantly being placed on our water sources.  The more regulations that are implemented on this industry to ensure the quality of drinking water from source to the end user the healthier we will be.  It is vital that we all do our part to ensure that one of our most critical resources is protected and managed effectively to be sustainable for future generations.  Drinking water systems must protect public health and conserve resource.<br>
<br>
Throughout the world there is a shift in attitudes and knowledge from:<br>
               safe drinking water safe is an inherent right <br>
                            to <br>
              safe drinking water is a valuable limited resource which must be managed properly to ensure sustainability.<br>
<br>
“(GPI Atlantic 2000)”<br>
“1/3 of Nova Scotians do not trust their drinking water”.<br>
<br>
“  During a time of budget restraints we need to keep in mind the necessary investments to maintain our water resources and learn from history that the costs of inadequate monitoring and enforcement of drinking water quality and disinvestment in environment protection produces major costs to society and the economy.”<br>
<br>
“Drinking water safety is different from general pollution abatement in a number of important respects.  First the public health and safety concerns arising from unsafe drinking water are acute and immediate.  If water is contaminated, people get sick or die.  As a result the system must focus on avoiding problems in the first place and taking swift corrective action when deficiencies are identified.”  <br>

Executive Summary<br>
   Every Province in Canada has its own unique challenges with current supplies of safe drinking water, and the urgency to find alternative methods of supply is the number one concern of all levels of government in Canada. waterlocker addresses these concerns by offering and making available to all individuals a secure, convenient, affordable means of maintaining an abundant supply of safe drinking water within each application. The waterlocker basic unit has a capacity to contain and distribute enough safe drinking water to sustain a family of four for three to four months between refills, with the capability to connect as many units as required for larger applications. waterlocker incorporates a management control system that monitors the exact amounts of potable water being distributed within each market area and to each application.  Our water supply is at a crucial stage where we must begin to manage and regulate this critical resource immediately and effectively in order to sustain its availability for future generations.  <br>

 Industry<br>
waterlocker Inc. is best described as a new level of distribution of potable water to residential and commercial applications.  The Industry as it stands does not offer this level of customer convenience and safety insofar as the sources currently marketing “drinking water”.  The market potential is unlimited as potable water is a critical requirement for all individuals.  According to surveys conducted throughout Canada in 2001 clearly 1/3 of Canadians did not trust their drinking water and must resort to purchasing bottled water as the next best alternative available; even though the quality and safety of bottled water may be questionable.  As well there is much concern regarding the environmental impact of disposable plastic bottles, not to mention the safety of the materials used in the manufacturing of these bottles.  The annual sales of bottled water in Canada is known to be in the billions of dollars; however an exact figure is difficult to ascertain based on available information. Several events have occurred that certainly elevate the number of individuals seeking alternatives for safe water, such as contamination events in Walkerton, North Battleford, and Kashechewan; as well the fact that on any given day there are usually 1000+ boil orders in effect across the country.  Our government estimates that 90,000 illnesses and 900 deaths occur in Canada annually due to contaminated drinking water, and independent health experts suggest a much higher number of Canadians suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses related to poor quality drinking water.   <br>

 The Company will comprise of several levels of production; distribution; service and sales activities.<br>
<br>
The primary focus of the company is to manufacture and distribute containment units (waterlocker tm); which will be constructed of a drinking water safe material. These units will be installed in residential and commercial applications by the company and will act as a holding tank for clean safe drinking water, which will be delivered to the application by tanker trucks specifically equipped by waterlocker Inc. to maintain the integrity of  contents; which will in turn be distributed throughout the application by means of the (waterlocker tm system) which incorporates a series of piping and fittings designed to allow the water to transfer to the end receptacle ie: (waterlocker tm dispenser)basic system<br>
First year projections are based on the company’s ability to manufacture and install approximately 13,000 (waterlocker tm) units, which represents less than 2% of the available market share potential in Nova Scotia. The first year amount of drinking water delivered will be approximately 50,000,000 liters, which again represents less than 2% of the available market share potential in Nova Scotia.<br>
The employment requirements are immediate and would include complete operations of a plastics plant capable of manufacturing the required number of (waterlocker tm) units. Also 15 installation technicians/ 15 water delivery representatives would be needed immediately to commence business objectives.<br>

Product [Prototype] Description and Product Advantage<br>
<br>
The present invention provides a drinking water distribution system purposed to store and then distribute potable drinking water throughout residential and/or commercial buildings for various applications. In particular the drinking water distribution system comprises a storage tank, hoses, and/or pipes fittingly connected to the storage tank that are deployed throughout a building, and at least one end unit, such as a water dispenser or a water cooler for example. Preferably the end unit has means to quickly connect or disconnect to the hose and/or pipe to access the storage tank. A more detailed description of total system configuration as outlined in Patent.<br>
<br>

Containment unit is designed to resemble a common rectangular gym locker in appearance. One of the unique features is the ability to connect as many waterlocker units as required for larger applications. This is achieved by removing a knockout plug located at bottom section of tank and joining to another tank by means of a fitting specifically designed for this purpose. This connector is threaded in the same direction on both sides of center nut and when tightened draws the two units together to form a watertight union. As many units as required/desired may be connected using this method, and is only limited by the available space in each application.<br>
