        <br>            ASI Group Ltd. (ASI) is a private Canadian company founded <br>in 1987.  The company develops and provides water and <br>wastewater services for industries, utilities and municipalities <br>specializing in remotely operated vehicle inspections of flooded <br>tunnels and pipelines, zebra mussel control, aquatic toxicology, <br>commercial diving, marine construction and water/wastewater <br>management.  The head office and laboratory is in St. Catharines, <br>Ontario with a second service branch located in Sarnia, Ontario. <br> The company has a growing staff of forty-five marine engineers, <br>technologists, biologists and commercial divers that are <br>complimented by experienced consultants and equipment suppliers <br>on a project-by-project basis.  ASI ensures that all aspects of <br>the project requirements are carefully monitored and remediation <br>solutions meet the objectives of the client.<br><br>ASI is recognized as the industrial leader in zebra mussel <br>control for raw water users.  The company has researched and <br>developed many of the Zebra Mussel control systems available in <br>the marketplace today.  Protocols developed for the control of <br>this non-indigenous exotic species in North American waters <br>include:  <br>· high intensity ultraviolet source<br>· cathodic protection<br>· oxidant use<br>· potash treatment<br>· heat treatment<br>· filter testing<br>· chlorination injection systems<br>ASI provides complete systems for inspection, monitoring and <br>treatment of water/wastewater, fireline protection and industrial <br>biomonitoring.  These systems are competitively priced and <br>suitably designed for operation to be monitored by plant <br>employees or on an outsourced basis. <br><br>Underwater inspection of water intakes and outfalls led to the <br>development of a fleet of purpose built remotely operated <br>vehicles (ROV). ROV&#39;s utilized for civil engineering assessment <br>of structural integrity of pipeline, tunnel and penstocks are <br>equipped with:<br>· topside controls (real time vehicle maneuvering). <br>· Bore-hole camera<br>· Non-destructive testing<br>· Ultrasound<br>· Radiography<br>· Sonar imaging<br>· fibreoptic technology sonar and function telemetry.  <br><br> These vehicles are capable of internal inspections of ranging <br>from pipelines 15 cm in diameter to tunnels 6 meters in diameter. <br> ASI has conducted over 300 miles of remote tunnel and pipeline <br>inspections since 1990. The company set a world distance record <br>(10km) as part of a 120 km tunnel inspection in Finland using an <br>ROV equipped with a fibreoptic umbilical specifically designed <br>for this type of project. <br><br>Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the <br>development of specialized installation repair and maintenance <br>technology.  ASI diving and ROV teams have gained wide <br>recognition for their practical experience and versatility in <br>handling complex technical assignments in hazardous underwater <br>environments. <br><br>R&amp;D is an important process at Aquatic Sciences Inc.  The company <br>is determined to provide technical solutions for utilities, <br>industries and municipalities facing increasing pressure for <br>environmental responsibility and profitability. In-house <br>toxicology facilities (CAEL certified), ecological measurement <br>and environmental assessment services enable ASI to provide every <br>phases of industrial water and wastewater management. By managing <br>the interfaces between disciplines, ASI is able to bundle <br>services and offer greater operating efficiencies in project <br>management.<br><br>CAEAL - Canadian Association of Environmental Laboratories<br>SCC - Standards Council of Canada<br>AWWA - American Water and Wastewater Association<br>OPCEA - Ontario Pollution Control Equipment Association<br>TEAM CANADA 1998 - Trade Mission to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, <br>Mexico<br>UMRUG - Utility Management Robotic Users Group<br>CTA - Canadian Tunnellers Association<br>ANS - American Nuclear Society<br>MTS - Marine Technology Society<br>ADC - American Association of Diving Contractors<br><br><br>Environmental Profile<br><br>Sub-sectors:<br><br>   1- Marine Inspection Services: Robotics - Underwater Inspections; commercial Diving; construction. 2- Environmental; 3- Toxicology; 4- Engineering.<br><br><br>   MARINE INSPECTION SERVICES<br><br><br>   PIPELINE AND TUNNEL INSPECTIONS: Civil Engineering inspections using various unmanned remotely operated vehicles (ROV) for continuous distances up to 10 km from a single access point. <br><br><br>   Structural underwater applications including: video and Sonar imaging; ultrasound; metal thickness/Non-destructive testing; geophysical surveys including sidescan sonar, sub-bottom profiling, bathymetry and positioning; cathodic protection surveys; location and tracking of buried pipelines; bridge structures; tunnel and shaft investigations; dam site investigations.<br><br><br>   REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE (ROV) FLEET FOR: tracked inspection system for small diameter pipelines; medium-sized conduits up to 1.5 km long; long tunnel inspections up to 10 km long; open water video inspections.<br><br><br>   MARINE CONSTRUCTION: installation of intake/outfall pipelines; underwater welding/cutting; grout injection and tremie concrete placement; bulkhead and coffer dam installation; mussel control system installations; salvage of sunken vessels; pipeline installation/remediation.<br><br><br>   INDUSTRIAL SERVICES AND MAINTENANCE: cleaning/removal of mussels; pumpwell clean-out; trash rack/travelling screen removal and installation; pipeline repair; water storage tanks/reservoir inspections; clarifier/digester/lagoon inspections and cleaning.<br><br><br>   ZEBRA MUSSEL CONTROL <br><br><br>   INDUSTRIAL CONTROL PROGRAMMES: identification of presence, mortality and life stage of zebra mussel larvae; site assessment for biofouling organisms - zebra mussel, algae, biofilm, etc.; treatment and monitoring of zebra mussel infestations for remediation; government permits and compliance reporting; cleaning and removal of mussel infestation.<br><br><br>   FIRELINE BIOFOULING CONTROL: dissolved oxygen monitoring; potash treatment.<br><br><br>   ALTERNATIVE ZEBRA MUSSEL CONTROL PROTOCOLS AND RESEARCH: heat treatment; high intensity UV source; filters; modified cathodic protection procedures; chemical treatments.<br><br><br>   ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL SERVICES <br><br><br>   ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SERVICES; aquatic environmental assessments; phase I, II, III Audits; EEM - Environmental Effects Monitoring; bathymetric and limnological surveys; mine closure and decommissioning plans.<br><br><br>   TECHNICAL SERVICES: storm and wastewater monitoring; industrial effluent monitoring; effluent quality monitoring; instrument installations and maintenance; leachate odour control facilities design and installation.<br><br><br>   ECOLOGICAL SERVICES: benthic and fish community analysis; habitat assessments; wildlife inventories; creel surveys; ecological risk assessment; wetland rehabilitation and restoration.<br><br><br>   ECOLOGICAL TOXICITY TESTING LABORATORY <br><br><br>   TESTING SERVICES: toxicology identification/reduction evaluations (TIE/TRE); in situ flow-through bioassays; avoidance response testing; MISA compliance for industrial effluent accuracy; aquatic toxicology tests for effluent: Algae, Daphnia magna, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Rainbow Trout, fathead minnow; sediment toxicity tests: Hyalella azteca, Hexagenia, Chironomus tentans; juvenile Fathead minnows; bacteria (microtox); marine toxicity tests; silver side, Purple sea urchin.<br><br><br>   PROTOCOLS FOLLOWED FOR: CAEAL, EPS, EPA, ASTM, APHA, ISO, OECD; MISA, PPER, EEM, MMLER <br><br><br>Aquatic Sciences Inc.

                            Aquatic Sciences Inc. (ASI) specializes in measuring the effets of chronic exposure of aquatic systems to effluent streams.  In an effort to simplify and more accurately reflect real world situations, while improving effluent quality, the use of whole effluent toxicity testing using single test species has become standard protocol.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Toxicity Identification Evaluations (TIE) protocols were developed to aid water dischargers who were having difficulty meeting toxicity regulations and who, therefore needed to characterize, identify and confirm the causative agents of toxicity in their effluent.  This evaluation can result in tremendous cost savings when compared to whole effluent treatment which often means dealing with very large volumes of water or conducting very expensive &quot;exploratory&quot; treatability studies and environmental audits and may ultimately save industry from the enforcement actions of environmental regulators if toxicity persists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1- Phase  I or toxicant characterization tests are designed to identify the physical/chemical properties of the toxic components of the effluent stream through a series of manipulations.  <br>
<br>
<br>
2- Phase II involves toxicant identification which Phase I tests have implicated and may result in toxicant treatability. <br>
<br>
3- Phase III confirmation testing of toxic agents is completed in order to isolate or identify artifacts in Phase I and II testing which were caused by the manipulations of these samples. <br>
<br>
4- Phase IV involves repetitive testing to develop correlations between the concentration of the suspect toxicant and effluent toxicity, to determine species sensitivity and to identify the specific toxicity of the compound in question through spiking, or deletion in test samples.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any single effluent treatment test does not by itself provide even limited proof that a certain toxicant or group of toxicants are causing effluent toxicity. As testing accumulates and the TIE proceeds, a &quot;weight of evidence &quot; develops that ultimately leads to confirmation of a suspected toxic source.<br>
<br>
<br>
ASI clients utilize the results of the TIE in order to determine the most economical method of dealing with the effluent toxicity.  If the results of the TIE indicate a specific chemical culprit, it is often most economical to eliminate or replace this chemical at source.<br>

                            ASI designs and implements reliable and cost effective alternatives to existing odour control facilities at traditional landfill sites.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Designs consist of: options for controlling the chemical dosing for odour control purposes; justification for the selected design; sizing of equipment; presentation of concept design drawings; compilation of an equipment and material list; options for data acquisition systems; renovation requirements for the odour control facility building; operation and maintenance requirements; budget cost for the installation; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Phase I: Design Phase; Phase II: Building Refurbishment; Phase III: System installation and commissioning; Phase IV: Service/maintenance and optimization of the new system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Typical odour control facilities are based on a flow proportional dosing control strategy which utilizes 12% (trade) sodium hypocholorite to neutralize odour causing chemical compounds in the effluent sewer. Prior to discharge to the municipal sanitary sewer the primary odour compounds are those that lead to the formation of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Odour control systems focus on oxidizing any sulphides present to either sulphate or colloidal sulphur.  The reaction of sodium hypochlorite with the suphites at the point of application is almost instantaneous.<br>
<br>
<br>
ASI recommends a chemical dosing control strategy option with a modified flow proportional based dosing system.  Control strategies are designed with appropriate alarms and safety features to ensure the system is operated in a safe and effective manner.<br>

ASI is recognized as the industrial leader in zebra mussel <br>
control for raw water users.  The company has researched and <br>
developed many of the Zebra Mussel control systems available in <br>
the marketplace today.  Protocols developed for the control of <br>
this non-indigenous exotic species in North American waters <br>
include:  <br>
· high intensity ultraviolet source<br>
· cathodic protection<br>
· oxidant use<br>
· potash treatment<br>
· heat treatment<br>
· filter testing<br>
· chlorination injection systems<br>
ASI provides complete systems for inspection, monitoring and <br>
treatment of water/wastewater, fireline protection and industrial <br>
biomonitoring.  These systems are competitively priced and <br>
suitably designed for operation to be monitored by plant <br>
employees or on an outsourced basis. <br>
<br>
Underwater inspection of water intakes and outfalls led to the <br>
development of a fleet of purpose built remotely operated <br>
vehicles (ROV). ROV&#39;s utilized for civil engineering assessment <br>
of structural integrity of pipeline, tunnel and penstocks are <br>
equipped with:<br>
· topside controls (real time vehicle maneuvering). <br>
· Bore-hole camera<br>
· Non-destructive testing<br>
· Ultrasound<br>
· Radiography<br>
· Sonar imaging<br>
· fibreoptic technology sonar and function telemetry.  <br>
<br>
These vehicles are capable of internal inspections of ranging <br>
from pipelines 15 cm in diameter to tunnels 6 meters in diameter. <br>
ASI has conducted over 300 miles of remote tunnel and pipeline <br>
inspections since 1990. The company set a world distance record <br>
(10km) as part of a 120 km tunnel inspection in Finland using an <br>
ROV equipped with a fibreoptic umbilical specifically designed <br>
for this type of project. <br>
<br>
Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the <br>
development of specialized installation repair and maintenance <br>
technology.  ASI diving and ROV teams have gained wide <br>
recognition for their practical experience and versatility in <br>
handling complex technical assignments in hazardous underwater <br>
environments. <br>

                            Underwater tunnels and pipelines with limited access have been difficult to inspect for structural integrity or obstructions.  Traditional dewatering techniques pose considerable structural and human risk when unstable conditions have been identified in the tunnel.  Aquatic Sciences Inc. (ASI) provides unmanned Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) to perform internal video and sonar inspections on pipelines ranging from 15 cm to 6 m in diameter.  Fibre optic technology integrated into the umbilical cable transports clear and detailed sonar and video images in real time to the surface control station.  Continuous inspections of 10 km are routine accomplishments for ASI&#39;s ROV expertise in long tunnel surveys. <br>
<br>
<br>
ASI owns and operates a fleet of ROV for the following applications: 1- ASI Pipecrawler - tracked inspection systems for small diameter pipelines; 2- SI Pipeliner - for medium-sized conduits; 3- ASI HD2 - for open water surveys; ASI Mantaro - for long tunnel inspections up to 10 km long.<br>
<br>
<br>
Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the development of specialized installation repair and maintenance technology.  ASI commercial diving and ROV teams have gained worldwide recognition for their practical experience and versatility in handling complex technical assignments in hazardous underwater environments.<br>

                            ASI is recognized as the industrial leader in zebra mussel <br>
control for raw water users.  The company has researched and <br>
developed many of the Zebra Mussel control systems available in <br>
the marketplace today.  Protocols developed for the control of <br>
this non-indigenous exotic species in North American waters <br>
include:  <br>
· high intensity ultraviolet source<br>
· cathodic protection<br>
· oxidant use<br>
· potash treatment<br>
· heat treatment<br>
· filter testing<br>
· chlorination injection systems<br>
ASI provides complete systems for inspection, monitoring and <br>
treatment of water/wastewater, fireline protection and industrial <br>
biomonitoring.  These systems are competitively priced and <br>
suitably designed for operation to be monitored by plant <br>
employees or on an outsourced basis. <br>
<br>
ASI has also developed a chlorination programme which utilizes <br>
sodium hypochlorite in an environmentally safe manner.  Through <br>
the use of low dose procedures, sophisticated effluent monitoring <br>
and control, industrial clients are able to ensure ``zero <br>
chlorine discharge`` into receiving waters.  These programmes are <br>
thoroughly tested by detailed analytical monitoring and  <br>
environmental impact analysis.  Utilizing these protocols ASI <br>
performs all aspects of the control as an economical outsourcing <br>
service for clients.<br>
<br>
Other innovations achieved by ASI are:<br>
· Specialized sampling techniques for contaminated environments<br>
· Robotic dredging<br>
· Data transmission systems utilizing radio telemetry<br>
· Stereo scopic underwater video dimensioning research <br>
· Ship ballast sampling systems for invasive species<br>

            Pipeline and Tunnel Inspections<br>
Assessment of structural integrity of flooded tunnels and <br>
pipelines prompted ASI to develop a fleet of specialized robotic <br>
vehicles.  These vehicles have the capability to complete <br>
internal inspections ranging from pipelines 15 cm in diameter to <br>
tunnels 6 meters in diameter.  Fibre-optic technology is <br>
currently applied in the completion of flooded tunnel <br>
inspections to produce clear and detailed images which can be transmitted <br>
over long distances.  Continuous inspections of 10 km and sonar <br>
imaging are now routine accomplishments.<br>
<br>
Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the development of <br>
specialized installation repair and maintenance technology.  ASI <br>
diving and ROV teams have gained wide recognition for their <br>
practical experience and versatility in handling complex <br>
technical assignments in hazardous underwater environments.<br>
<br>
Zebra Mussel Control<br>
ASI has conducted and completed a number of significant research <br>
and development programmes which have established techniques and <br>
protocols for industrial control of zebra mussel biofouling.  <br>
Chemical and non-chemical treatments designed and implemented <br>
include:<br>
· Ultraviolet light (patented)<br>
· Modified cathodic protection procedures (submitted for patent <br>
protection)<br>
· Potash - utilized in static systems such as Fire Control<br>
· Heat treatment - utilized in thermal power plants<br>
<br>
ASI has developed a chlorination programme which utilizes sodium <br>
hypochlorite in an environmentally safe manner.  Industrial <br>
clients are able to ensure &quot;zero chlorine discharge&quot; into <br>
receiving waters through the use of low dose procedures and <br>
sophisticated effluent monitoring.  These programmes are <br>
thoroughly tested by detailed analytical monitoring and <br>
environmental impact assessment.  Utilizing these protocols, ASI <br>
performs all aspects of the control programme as an economical <br>
outsourcing service for clients.<br>
<br>
Other Innovations Achieved by ASI<br>
· Specialized sampling techniques for contaminated environments<br>
· Robotic dredging<br>
· Stereoscopic underwater video dimensioning research<br>
· Ship ballast sampling systems for non-indigenous invasive <br>
  species

                            Aquatic Sciences Inc. (ASI) specializes in measuring the effets of chronic exposure of aquatic systems to effluent streams.  In an effort to simplify and more accurately reflect real world situations, while improving effluent quality, the use of whole effluent toxicity testing using single test species has become standard protocol.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Toxicity Identification Evaluations (TIE) protocols were developed to aid water dischargers who were having difficulty meeting toxicity regulations and who, therefore needed to characterize, identify and confirm the causative agents of toxicity in their effluent.  This evaluation can result in tremendous cost savings when compared to whole effluent treatment which often means dealing with very large volumes of water or conducting very expensive &quot;exploratory&quot; treatability studies and environmental audits and may ultimately save industry from the enforcement actions of environmental regulators if toxicity persists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1- Phase  I or toxicant characterization tests are designed to identify the physical/chemical properties of the toxic components of the effluent stream through a series of manipulations.  <br>
<br>
<br>
2- Phase II involves toxicant identification which Phase I tests have implicated and may result in toxicant treatability. <br>
<br>
3- Phase III confirmation testing of toxic agents is completed in order to isolate or identify artifacts in Phase I and II testing which were caused by the manipulations of these samples. <br>
<br>
4- Phase IV involves repetitive testing to develop correlations between the concentration of the suspect toxicant and effluent toxicity, to determine species sensitivity and to identify the specific toxicity of the compound in question through spiking, or deletion in test samples.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any single effluent treatment test does not by itself provide even limited proof that a certain toxicant or group of toxicants are causing effluent toxicity. As testing accumulates and the TIE proceeds, a &quot;weight of evidence &quot; develops that ultimately leads to confirmation of a suspected toxic source.<br>
<br>
<br>
ASI clients utilize the results of the TIE in order to determine the most economical method of dealing with the effluent toxicity.  If the results of the TIE indicate a specific chemical culprit, it is often most economical to eliminate or replace this chemical at source.<br>

                            ASI designs and implements reliable and cost effective alternatives to existing odour control facilities at traditional landfill sites.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Designs consist of: options for controlling the chemical dosing for odour control purposes; justification for the selected design; sizing of equipment; presentation of concept design drawings; compilation of an equipment and material list; options for data acquisition systems; renovation requirements for the odour control facility building; operation and maintenance requirements; budget cost for the installation; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Phase I: Design Phase; Phase II: Building Refurbishment; Phase III: System installation and commissioning; Phase IV: Service/maintenance and optimization of the new system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Typical odour control facilities are based on a flow proportional dosing control strategy which utilizes 12% (trade) sodium hypocholorite to neutralize odour causing chemical compounds in the effluent sewer. Prior to discharge to the municipal sanitary sewer the primary odour compounds are those that lead to the formation of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Odour control systems focus on oxidizing any sulphides present to either sulphate or colloidal sulphur.  The reaction of sodium hypochlorite with the suphites at the point of application is almost instantaneous.<br>
<br>
<br>
ASI recommends a chemical dosing control strategy option with a modified flow proportional based dosing system.  Control strategies are designed with appropriate alarms and safety features to ensure the system is operated in a safe and effective manner.<br>

                            Aquatic Sciences Inc. (ASI) is a private Canadian company founded <br>
in 1987.  The company develops and provides of water and <br>
wastewater services for industries, utilities and municipalities <br>
specializing in remotely operated vehicle inspections of flooded <br>
tunnels and pipelines, zebra mussel control, aquatic toxicology, <br>
commercial diving, marine construction and water/wastewater <br>
management.  The head office and laboratory is in St. Catharines, <br>
Ontario with a second service branch located in Sarnia, Ontario. <br>
The company has a growing staff of forty-five marine engineers, <br>
technologists, biologists and commercial divers that are <br>
complimented by experienced consultants and equipment suppliers <br>
on a project-by-project basis.  ASI ensures that all aspects of <br>
the project requirements are carefully monitored and remediation <br>
solutions meet the objectives of the client.<br>
<br>
ASI is recognized as the industrial leader in zebra mussel <br>
control for raw water users.  The company has researched and <br>
developed many of the Zebra Mussel control systems available in <br>
the marketplace today.  Protocols developed for the control of <br>
this non-indigenous exotic species in North American waters <br>
include:  <br>
· high intensity ultraviolet source<br>
· cathodic protection<br>
· oxidant use<br>
· potash treatment<br>
· heat treatment<br>
· filter testing<br>
· chlorination injection systems<br>
ASI provides complete systems for inspection, monitoring and <br>
treatment of water/wastewater, fireline protection and industrial <br>
biomonitoring.  These systems are competitively priced and <br>
suitably designed for operation to be monitored by plant <br>
employees or on an outsourced basis. <br>
<br>
Underwater inspection of water intakes and outfalls led to the <br>
development of a fleet of purpose built remotely operated <br>
vehicles (ROV). ROV&#39;s utilized for civil engineering assessment <br>
of structural integrity of pipeline, tunnel and penstocks are <br>
equipped with:<br>
· topside controls (real time vehicle maneuvering). <br>
· Bore-hole camera<br>
· Non-destructive testing<br>
· Ultrasound<br>
· Radiography<br>
· Sonar imaging<br>
· fibreoptic technology sonar and function telemetry.  <br>
<br>
These vehicles are capable of internal inspections of ranging <br>
from pipelines 15 cm in diameter to tunnels 6 meters in diameter. <br>
ASI has conducted over 300 miles of remote tunnel and pipeline <br>
inspections since 1990. The company set a world distance record <br>
(10km) as part of a 120 km tunnel inspection in Finland using an <br>
ROV equipped with a fibreoptic umbilical specifically designed <br>
for this type of project. <br>
<br>
Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the <br>
development of specialized installation repair and maintenance <br>
technology.  ASI diving and ROV teams have gained wide <br>
recognition for their practical experience and versatility in <br>
handling complex technical assignments in hazardous underwater <br>
environments. <br>
<br>
R&amp;D is an important process at Aquatic Sciences Inc.  The company <br>
is determined to provide technical solutions for utilities, <br>
industries and municipalities facing increasing pressure for <br>
environmental responsibility and profitability. In-house <br>
toxicology facilities (CAEL certified), ecological measurement <br>
and environmental assessment services enable ASI to provide every <br>
phases of industrial water and wastewater management. By managing <br>
the interfaces between disciplines, ASI is able to bundle <br>
services and offer greater operating efficiencies in project <br>
management.<br>

                            Underwater inspection of water intakes and outfalls led to the <br>
development of a fleet of purpose built remotely operated <br>
vehicles (ROV). ROV&#39;s utilized for civil engineering assessment <br>
of structural integrity of pipeline, tunnel and penstocks are <br>
equipped with:<br>
· topside controls (real time vehicle maneuvering). <br>
· Bore-hole camera<br>
· Non-destructive testing<br>
· Ultrasound<br>
· Radiography<br>
· Sonar imaging<br>
· fibreoptic technology sonar and function telemetry.  <br>
<br>
These vehicles are capable of internal inspections of ranging <br>
from pipelines 15 cm in diameter to tunnels 6 meters in diameter. <br>
ASI has conducted over 300 miles of remote tunnel and pipeline <br>
inspections since 1990. The company set a world distance record <br>
(10km) as part of a 120 km tunnel inspection in Finland using an <br>
ROV equipped with a fibreoptic umbilical specifically designed <br>
for this type of project. <br>
<br>
Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the <br>
development of specialized installation repair and maintenance <br>
technology.  ASI diving and ROV teams have gained wide <br>
recognition for their practical experience and versatility in <br>
handling complex technical assignments in hazardous underwater <br>
environments. <br>

                            Underwater tunnels and pipelines with limited access have been difficult to inspect for structural integrity or obstructions.  Traditional dewatering techniques pose considerable structural and human risk when unstable conditions have been identified in the tunnel.  Aquatic Sciences Inc. (ASI) provides unmanned Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) to perform internal video and sonar inspections on pipelines ranging from 15 cm to 6 m in diameter.  Fibre optic technology integrated into the umbilical cable transports clear and detailed sonar and video images in real time to the surface control station.  Continuous inspections of 10 km are routine accomplishments for ASI&#39;s ROV expertise in long tunnel surveys. <br>
<br>
<br>
ASI owns and operates a fleet of ROV for the following applications: 1- ASI Pipecrawler - tracked inspection systems for small diameter pipelines; 2- SI Pipeliner - for medium-sized conduits; 3- ASI HD2 - for open water surveys; ASI Mantaro - for long tunnel inspections up to 10 km long.<br>
<br>
<br>
Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the development of specialized installation repair and maintenance technology.  ASI commercial diving and ROV teams have gained worldwide recognition for their practical experience and versatility in handling complex technical assignments in hazardous underwater environments.<br>

                            ASI is recognized as the industrial leader in zebra mussel <br>
control for raw water users.  The company has researched and <br>
developed many of the Zebra Mussel control systems available in <br>
the marketplace today.  Protocols developed for the control of <br>
this non-indigenous exotic species in North American waters <br>
include:  <br>
· high intensity ultraviolet source<br>
· cathodic protection<br>
· oxidant use<br>
· potash treatment<br>
· heat treatment<br>
· filter testing<br>
· chlorination injection systems<br>
ASI provides complete systems for inspection, monitoring and <br>
treatment of water/wastewater, fireline protection and industrial <br>
biomonitoring.  These systems are competitively priced and <br>
suitably designed for operation to be monitored by plant <br>
employees or on an outsourced basis. <br>
<br>
ASI has also developed a chlorination programme which utilizes <br>
sodium hypochlorite in an environmentally safe manner.  Through <br>
the use of low dose procedures, sophisticated effluent monitoring <br>
and control, industrial clients are able to ensure ``zero <br>
chlorine discharge`` into receiving waters.  These programmes are <br>
thoroughly tested by detailed analytical monitoring and  <br>
environmental impact analysis.  Utilizing these protocols ASI <br>
performs all aspects of the control as an economical outsourcing <br>
service for clients.<br>
<br>
Other innovations achieved by ASI are:<br>
· Specialized sampling techniques for contaminated environments<br>
· Robotic dredging<br>
· Data transmission systems utilizing radio telemetry<br>
· Stereo scopic underwater video dimensioning research <br>
· Ship ballast sampling systems for invasive species<br>

            Pipeline and Tunnel Inspections<br>
Assessment of structural integrity of flooded tunnels and <br>
pipelines prompted ASI to develop a fleet of specialized robotic <br>
vehicles.  These vehicles have the capability to complete <br>
internal inspections ranging from pipelines 15 cm in diameter to <br>
tunnels 6 meters in diameter.  Fibre-optic technology is <br>
currently applied in the completion of flooded tunnel <br>
inspections to produce clear and detailed images which can be transmitted <br>
over long distances.  Continuous inspections of 10 km and sonar <br>
imaging are now routine accomplishments.<br>
<br>
Findings from underwater inspections have resulted in the development of <br>
specialized installation repair and maintenance technology.  ASI <br>
diving and ROV teams have gained wide recognition for their <br>
practical experience and versatility in handling complex <br>
technical assignments in hazardous underwater environments.<br>
<br>
Zebra Mussel Control<br>
ASI has conducted and completed a number of significant research <br>
and development programmes which have established techniques and <br>
protocols for industrial control of zebra mussel biofouling.  <br>
Chemical and non-chemical treatments designed and implemented <br>
include:<br>
· Ultraviolet light (patented)<br>
· Modified cathodic protection procedures (submitted for patent <br>
protection)<br>
· Potash - utilized in static systems such as Fire Control<br>
· Heat treatment - utilized in thermal power plants<br>
<br>
ASI has developed a chlorination programme which utilizes sodium <br>
hypochlorite in an environmentally safe manner.  Industrial <br>
clients are able to ensure &quot;zero chlorine discharge&quot; into <br>
receiving waters through the use of low dose procedures and <br>
sophisticated effluent monitoring.  These programmes are <br>
thoroughly tested by detailed analytical monitoring and <br>
environmental impact assessment.  Utilizing these protocols, ASI <br>
performs all aspects of the control programme as an economical <br>
outsourcing service for clients.<br>
<br>
Other Innovations Achieved by ASI<br>
· Specialized sampling techniques for contaminated environments<br>
· Robotic dredging<br>
· Stereoscopic underwater video dimensioning research<br>
· Ship ballast sampling systems for non-indigenous invasive <br>
  species
