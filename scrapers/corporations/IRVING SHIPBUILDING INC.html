<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. (ISI) has the resources, skill levels <br>
and management expertise to build large vessels and structures <br>
for the offshore oil and gas  industry and to provide <br>
engineering, construction and repair/maintenance support.<br>
<br>
Facilities are adjacent to deep water and are within easy access <br>
to the gas and oil fields off the East Coast of Canada.<br>
<br>
Experience<br>
Irving Shipbuilding&#39;s new construction build strategies are based <br>
on modular construction, a product-by-stage build philosophy, <br>
extensive pre-outfitting of modules and &#39;just in time&#39; material <br>
provisioning. Sophisticated accuracy and dimensional control <br>
techniques of each construction stage minimize rework. This <br>
approach has allowed us to maximize quality and to reduce cost <br>
and schedule.<br>
<br>
ISI&#39;s Saint John Shipbuilding division built the Bow Drill 3 <br>
Semi-Submersible Drill Rig (Aker #3.2) for Bow Valley. SJS has <br>
also built outfitted Derrick and Drill floor modules for the <br>
Hibernia Production Platform and steel modules for  semi <br>
submersibles built for Ham Marine.<br>
<br>
ISI&#39;s unique experience includes the construction of dynamically <br>
positioned semi-submersible and mono-hulled drilling vessels. The <br>
internationally acclaimed dynamically positioned vessel SEDCO 471 <br>
was built by the Halifax Shipyard division.<br>
<br>
Facilities<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. employs modern computerized engineering <br>
resources for detail design, planning and procurement.<br>
<br>
State-of-the-art assembly lines provide fast and accurate steel <br>
fabrication and modules are extensively outfitted under cover. <br>
Heavy-lift transporters move outfitted modules to large erection <br>
areas serviced by two 600 t cranes.<br>
<br>
Irving Shipbuilding produces high quality work on time and within <br>
budget with a highly skilled work force. Facilities are state of <br>
the art.<br>
<br>
All ISI facilities have excellent safety records as a result of <br>
comprehensive safety plans and procedures.<br>
<br>
Project Management<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. has valuable recent experience in <br>
complex project management derived from large naval construction <br>
projects for the Canadian Government, including acting as Prime <br>
Contractor and Program Manager for the $6.2 billion Canadian <br>
Patrol Frigate Project.<br>
<br>
Dedicated teams of specialists aggressively monitor project <br>
progress, schedules and costs. These efforts are supported by <br>
extensive computer systems which generate accurate, timely <br>
management information.<br>

 <br>
The CPF (Canadian Patrol Frigate) Project was a landmark in <br>
Canadian Naval History.  For the first time a private contractor <br>
assumed Total Systems Integration  Responsibility for the design, <br>
construction, integration and through life support of a  class of <br>
warships.<br>
<br>
The Canadian Navy was provided with a complete package: twelve <br>
fully operational frigates, backed by Integrated Logistics <br>
Support, produced with maximum benefit to Canadian industry, <br>
within a strict schedule at a fixed ceiling price.<br>
<br>
To meet the CPF challenge a Centre of Excellence was developed <br>
comprising hundreds of professionals in a variety of disciplines. <br>
This experienced team handled  responsibilities in the following <br>
areas.<br>
<br>
Program Management <br>
Design and Engineering <br>
Quality Assurance <br>
Materials Management <br>
Integrated Logistic Support <br>
Industrial Benefits <br>
Modular Construction <br>
<br>
World leading Canadian Technology developed for CPF is available <br>
in a variety of vessel designs.<br>

                            Coastal Defence Vessels<br>
<br>
Twelve Canadian Maritime Coastal Defence Vessels (MCDV) are in <br>
service with the Canadian Navy. MCDVs are modern and employ <br>
Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment for cost effectiveness. <br>
They are extremely manoeuvrable and simple to operate and <br>
maintain. In Canada, the vessels are manned by rotating Naval <br>
Reserve crews who receive introductory training in all aspects of <br>
naval vessel operation.<br>
<br>
MCDV is very versatile and can deploy a wide range of specialized <br>
modular payloads which can be installed in 24 hours. These <br>
include, but are not limited to:<br>
<br>
  Towed Side Scan Sonar <br>
  Remotely Operated Vehicles <br>
  Mine Sweeping Gear <br>
  Pollution Control <br>
  Diving and Recovery <br>
<br>
Signal data from payloads is routed through pre-installed cabling <br>
and fibre optics to be displayed in the Operations Room and <br>
Bridge.<br>
<br>
Simpler modules can also be installed. MCDV&#39;s general cargo <br>
carrying capacity and its ability to export Electrical Power make <br>
it ideally suited to provide disaster relief in remote areas.<br>
<br>
For insertion or interdiction duties, MCDV can be fitted with <br>
handling gear to deploy a fast assault craft from its aft end.<br>
<br>
The vessel is fitted with a comprehensive communications suite <br>
and a variety of weapons and sensors can be fitted.<br>
<br>
Accommodation standards are high and the MCDV is designed to <br>
operate in any area of the world.<br>
<br>
MCDVs are supported with a proven logistics support and training <br>
program.<br>

                            Z-Drive Harbour / Coastal Tugs<br>
<br>
Versatility and Dependability<br>
<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. offers a series of Z-drive harbour tug <br>
designs ranging from 1550 bhp to 4000 bhp with common layouts and <br>
main machinery and thruster suppliers.<br>
<br>
Tug designs are based on existing vessels which are currently in <br>
service and can be viewed.<br>
<br>
Operation<br>
All-welded, steel-built tug can be equipped for harbour and/or <br>
coastal duties.  Propulsion provided by twin azimuthing Z-drive <br>
thrusters, each driven by a high speed marine diesel engine.<br>
<br>
Built to the requirements of ABS/Lloyds&#39; register. Safety outfit <br>
in compliance  with the  requirements of the Canadian Coast <br>
Guard.<br>
<br>
The vessel is normally operated from the air-conditioned pilot <br>
house and with the machinery space unmanned.<br>
<br>
Ship handling operations are normally conducted over the bow <br>
using a powered line-handling winch and a robust, resilient <br>
fendering system.<br>
<br>
Potential outfitting options include crew accommodation to <br>
support coastal towing service, fire fighting (FIFI 1) and oil <br>
pollution control equipment.<br>
<br>
Z-Drive<br>
Z-drive propulsion units have been selected and arranged in the <br>
``reverse-tractor`` configuration having the following <br>
operational and safety advantages:<br>
 High bollard pull <br>
 Exceptional manoeuverability <br>
 Control over tug position and direction is highly accurate <br>
 Thrust is almost equal over 360° <br>
 All work performed in one direction, over the bow <br>
 Tug can rapidly change from ``push`` to ``pull`` mode <br>
 Operator always facing the attended ship <br>
 Risk of girting eliminated <br>
 High speed with effective thrust on the side of the moving ship <br>
 Drive units can be arranged to be withdrawn and replaced with <br>
 the tug afloat <br>
 Draft greater than with conventional propulsion <br>
 Powered line-handling winches (tow hooks optional) <br>
<br>
Flexibility<br>
 Fire fighting and ability to spray oil dispersant is available <br>
 Increased crew accommodation can be provided <br>

                                                      <br>
Several innovations are incorporated into the design of this <br>
vessel. Among the features are the following:<br>
<br>
A spoon shaped bow which enables the ship to break ice with <br>
minimum use of propulsion power. <br>
A water spray system which reduces the friction of the ship&#39;s <br>
hull against ice. <br>
A set of extruders (or reamers) at the start of the mid-body. The <br>
extruders create a channel through the ice, the channel being two <br>
meters wider than the width of the vessel.  An arrangement of <br>
single screw machinery, comprising two medium speed diesel <br>
engines geared to a shaft line and a controllable pitch <br>
controller, which operates in a protective nozzle. <br>

Fabrication and Assembly<br>
The assembly shop is divided into four areas:<br>
- Panel Line<br>
- Curved Assembly<br>
- Sub-Assembly<br>
- Main Assembly<br>
<br>
Ahead of the panel line are two CNC buming machines each having <br>
dual plasma underwater cutting heads, one bevelling, capable of <br>
cutting 16m X 3.6m plates.<br>
<br>
The panel line is capable of producing flat panels up to 16m wide <br>
X 18m long (nominal).  The panel line consists of one sided <br>
welding machines, panel flame planers, automatic stiffener <br>
positioners, web fitting gantries, web welding gantries, <br>
workstations with ultra heavy lift systems, and a 280t loadout <br>
station.<br>
<br>
The curved assembly area incorporates mobile pin jigs&#39; serviced <br>
with stiffener and welding gantries.<br>
<br>
The sub-assembly area consists of a semi-automatic line served by <br>
tow semi-portal 10t cranes and a 20 t overhead hook crane.<br>
<br>
The main assembly area is where the smaller sub-assemblies are <br>
joined to form shaped units.  This area is served by tow 75t <br>
cranes and one 10t crane.<br>
<br>
Over and above this equipment are 1500t hydraulic rolls, a 500t <br>
hydraulic press and guillotine shears.<br>

TEAMING UP FOR CANADA&#39;S EAST COAST OFFSHORE PROJECTS<br>
<br>
Canada&#39;s largest shipbuilder, Irving Shipbuilding Inc., and major <br>
international offshore contractor AMEC, have formed a strategic <br>
alliance to win work on future offshore developments on Canada&#39;s <br>
East Coast.<br>
<br>
The agreement creates a Canadian-led alliance, with the necessary <br>
skills and experience to provide clients with fully integrated <br>
solutions for offshore oil and gas projects.<br>
<br>
Irving Shipbuilding has major ship construction and fabrication <br>
facilities in Saint John, New Brunswick and Halifax, Nova Scotia. <br>
 The company is an experienced builder of offshore drilling <br>
support vessels, and fabricator of modules for offshore <br>
installations.  Irving Shipbuilding Inc. has a proven track <br>
record in building offshore drilling vessels, both <br>
semi-submersible and mono-hulled, having completed eight vessels <br>
for SEDCO Drilling and Bow Valley.  The company has also <br>
fabricated the drilling modules for the major Hibernia platform.<br>
<br>
AMED, Europe&#39;s most experienced offshore contractor, provides <br>
clients with a complete ``life of asset`` service for offshore <br>
developments.  Internationally, AMEC has been involved in major <br>
offshore projects as far afield as Brazil, China, and Australia.<br>
<br>
Andrew McArthur, Vice Chairman of Irving Shipbuilding Inc. said, <br>
``Both organizations are recognized as best in class&#39; in their <br>
respective fields and this alliance offers a particularly <br>
powerful combination for large or difficult offshore projects.``<br>
<br>
Neil Bruce, Managing Director of AMEC Offshore added, ``The great <br>
advantage of this Canadian led alliance is that it provides <br>
clients with world class solutions&#39; to offshore developments <br>
provided from a Canadian base.``<br>
<br>
AMEC Offshore Ltd., part of AMEC, the international capital <br>
projects, services and investment group which generated a <br>
turnover of £3.4 billion ($C7.8 billion) in 1998, employs 22,000 <br>
people worldwide.<br>
<br>
AMEC Offshore has over 25 years of international offshore <br>
experience having engineered 400,000 tonnes and fabricated over <br>
375,000 tonnes of offshore facilities and has provided 90 million <br>
manhours of offshore services.

Drill Modules for the Hibernia Project<br>
These structures were delivered by barge to the final erection <br>
site in Bull Arm, Newfoundland. (Image compliments of Hibernia)<br>
<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. (ISI) has the resources, skill levels <br>
and management expertise to build large vessels and structures <br>
for the offshore oil and gas  industry and to provide <br>
engineering, construction and repair/maintenance support.<br>
<br>
Facilities are adjacent to deep water and are within easy access <br>
to the gas and oil fields off the East Coast of Canada.<br>
<br>
Experience<br>
Irving Shipbuilding&#39;s new construction build strategies are based <br>
on modular construction, a product-by-stage build philosophy, <br>
extensive pre-outfitting of modules and &#39;just in time&#39; material <br>
provisioning. Sophisticated accuracy and dimensional control <br>
techniques of each construction stage minimize rework. This <br>
approach has allowed us to maximize quality and to reduce cost <br>
and schedule.<br>
<br>
ISI&#39;s Saint John Shipbuilding division built the Bow Drill 3 <br>
Semi-Submersible Drill Rig (Aker #3.2) for Bow Valley. SJS has <br>
also built outfitted Derrick and Drill floor modules for the <br>
Hibernia Production Platform and steel modules for  semi <br>
submersibles built for Ham Marine.<br>
<br>
ISI&#39;s unique experience includes the construction of dynamically <br>
positioned semi-submersible and mono-hulled drilling vessels. The <br>
internationally acclaimed dynamically positioned vessel SEDCO 471 <br>
was built by the Halifax Shipyard division.<br>
<br>
Facilities<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. employs modern computerized engineering <br>
resources for detail design, planning and procurement.<br>
<br>
State-of-the-art assembly lines provide fast and accurate steel <br>
fabrication and modules are extensively outfitted under cover. <br>
Heavy-lift transporters move outfitted modules to large erection <br>
areas serviced by two 600 t cranes.<br>
<br>
Irving Shipbuilding produces high quality work on time and within <br>
budget with a highly skilled work force. Facilities are state of <br>
the art.<br>
<br>
All ISI facilities have excellent safety records as a result of <br>
comprehensive safety plans and procedures.<br>
<br>
Project Management<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. has valuable recent experience in <br>
complex project management derived from large naval construction <br>
projects for the Canadian Government, including acting as Prime <br>
Contractor and Program Manager for the $6.2 billion Canadian <br>
Patrol Frigate Project.<br>
<br>
Dedicated teams of specialists aggressively monitor project <br>
progress, schedules and costs. These efforts are supported by <br>
extensive computer systems which generate accurate, timely <br>
management information.<br>

 <br>
The CPF (Canadian Patrol Frigate) Project was a landmark in <br>
Canadian Naval History.  For the first time a private contractor <br>
assumed Total Systems Integration  Responsibility for the design, <br>
construction, integration and through life support of a  class of <br>
warships.<br>
<br>
The Canadian Navy was provided with a complete package: twelve <br>
fully operational frigates, backed by Integrated Logistics <br>
Support, produced with maximum benefit to Canadian industry, <br>
within a strict schedule at a fixed ceiling price.<br>
<br>
To meet the CPF challenge a Centre of Excellence was developed <br>
comprising hundreds of professionals in a variety of disciplines. <br>
This experienced team handled  responsibilities in the following <br>
areas.<br>
<br>
Program Management <br>
Design and Engineering <br>
Quality Assurance <br>
Materials Management <br>
Integrated Logistic Support <br>
Industrial Benefits <br>
Modular Construction <br>
<br>
World leading Canadian Technology developed for CPF is available <br>
in a variety of vessel designs.<br>

                            Coastal Defence Vessels<br>
<br>
Twelve Canadian Maritime Coastal Defence Vessels (MCDV) are in <br>
service with the Canadian Navy. MCDVs are modern and employ <br>
Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment for cost effectiveness. <br>
They are extremely manoeuvrable and simple to operate and <br>
maintain. In Canada, the vessels are manned by rotating Naval <br>
Reserve crews who receive introductory training in all aspects of <br>
naval vessel operation.<br>
<br>
MCDV is very versatile and can deploy a wide range of specialized <br>
modular payloads which can be installed in 24 hours. These <br>
include, but are not limited to:<br>
<br>
  Towed Side Scan Sonar <br>
  Remotely Operated Vehicles <br>
  Mine Sweeping Gear <br>
  Pollution Control <br>
  Diving and Recovery <br>
<br>
Signal data from payloads is routed through pre-installed cabling <br>
and fibre optics to be displayed in the Operations Room and <br>
Bridge.<br>
<br>
Simpler modules can also be installed. MCDV&#39;s general cargo <br>
carrying capacity and its ability to export Electrical Power make <br>
it ideally suited to provide disaster relief in remote areas.<br>
<br>
For insertion or interdiction duties, MCDV can be fitted with <br>
handling gear to deploy a fast assault craft from its aft end.<br>
<br>
The vessel is fitted with a comprehensive communications suite <br>
and a variety of weapons and sensors can be fitted.<br>
<br>
Accommodation standards are high and the MCDV is designed to <br>
operate in any area of the world.<br>
<br>
MCDVs are supported with a proven logistics support and training <br>
program.<br>

                            Z-Drive Harbour / Coastal Tugs<br>
<br>
Versatility and Dependability<br>
<br>
Irving Shipbuilding Inc. offers a series of Z-drive harbour tug <br>
designs ranging from 1550 bhp to 4000 bhp with common layouts and <br>
main machinery and thruster suppliers.<br>
<br>
Tug designs are based on existing vessels which are currently in <br>
service and can be viewed.<br>
<br>
Operation<br>
All-welded, steel-built tug can be equipped for harbour and/or <br>
coastal duties.  Propulsion provided by twin azimuthing Z-drive <br>
thrusters, each driven by a high speed marine diesel engine.<br>
<br>
Built to the requirements of ABS/Lloyds&#39; register. Safety outfit <br>
in compliance  with the  requirements of the Canadian Coast <br>
Guard.<br>
<br>
The vessel is normally operated from the air-conditioned pilot <br>
house and with the machinery space unmanned.<br>
<br>
Ship handling operations are normally conducted over the bow <br>
using a powered line-handling winch and a robust, resilient <br>
fendering system.<br>
<br>
Potential outfitting options include crew accommodation to <br>
support coastal towing service, fire fighting (FIFI 1) and oil <br>
pollution control equipment.<br>
<br>
Z-Drive<br>
Z-drive propulsion units have been selected and arranged in the <br>
``reverse-tractor`` configuration having the following <br>
operational and safety advantages:<br>
 High bollard pull <br>
 Exceptional manoeuverability <br>
 Control over tug position and direction is highly accurate <br>
 Thrust is almost equal over 360° <br>
 All work performed in one direction, over the bow <br>
 Tug can rapidly change from ``push`` to ``pull`` mode <br>
 Operator always facing the attended ship <br>
 Risk of girting eliminated <br>
 High speed with effective thrust on the side of the moving ship <br>
 Drive units can be arranged to be withdrawn and replaced with <br>
 the tug afloat <br>
 Draft greater than with conventional propulsion <br>
 Powered line-handling winches (tow hooks optional) <br>
<br>
Flexibility<br>
 Fire fighting and ability to spray oil dispersant is available <br>
 Increased crew accommodation can be provided <br>

                                                      <br>
Several innovations are incorporated into the design of this <br>
vessel. Among the features are the following:<br>
<br>
A spoon shaped bow which enables the ship to break ice with <br>
minimum use of propulsion power. <br>
A water spray system which reduces the friction of the ship&#39;s <br>
hull against ice. <br>
A set of extruders (or reamers) at the start of the mid-body. The <br>
extruders create a channel through the ice, the channel being two <br>
meters wider than the width of the vessel.  An arrangement of <br>
single screw machinery, comprising two medium speed diesel <br>
engines geared to a shaft line and a controllable pitch <br>
controller, which operates in a protective nozzle. <br>

Fabrication and Assembly<br>
The assembly shop is divided into four areas:<br>
- Panel Line<br>
- Curved Assembly<br>
- Sub-Assembly<br>
- Main Assembly<br>
<br>
Ahead of the panel line are two CNC buming machines each having <br>
dual plasma underwater cutting heads, one bevelling, capable of <br>
cutting 16m X 3.6m plates.<br>
<br>
The panel line is capable of producing flat panels up to 16m wide <br>
X 18m long (nominal).  The panel line consists of one sided <br>
welding machines, panel flame planers, automatic stiffener <br>
positioners, web fitting gantries, web welding gantries, <br>
workstations with ultra heavy lift systems, and a 280t loadout <br>
station.<br>
<br>
The curved assembly area incorporates mobile pin jigs&#39; serviced <br>
with stiffener and welding gantries.<br>
<br>
The sub-assembly area consists of a semi-automatic line served by <br>
tow semi-portal 10t cranes and a 20 t overhead hook crane.<br>
<br>
The main assembly area is where the smaller sub-assemblies are <br>
joined to form shaped units.  This area is served by tow 75t <br>
cranes and one 10t crane.<br>
<br>
Over and above this equipment are 1500t hydraulic rolls, a 500t <br>
hydraulic press and guillotine shears.<br>
<br>
Module Hall<br>

Ahead of the panel line are two CNC buming machines each having <br>
dual plasma underwater cutting heads, one bevelling, capable of <br>
cutting 16m X 3.6m plates.<br>
<br>
The panel line is capable of producing flat panels up to 16m wide <br>
X 18m long (nominal).  The panel line consists of one sided <br>
welding machines, panel flame planers, automatic stiffener <br>
positioners, web fitting gantries, web welding gantries, <br>
workstations with ultra heavy lift systems, and a 280t loadout <br>
station.<br>
<br>
The curved assembly area incorporates mobile pin jigs&#39; serviced <br>
with stiffener and welding gantries.<br>
<br>
The sub-assembly area consists of a semi-automatic line served by <br>
tow semi-portal 10t cranes and a 20 t overhead hook crane.<br>
<br>
The main assembly area is where the smaller sub-assemblies are <br>
joined to form shaped units.  This area is served by tow 75t <br>
cranes and one 10t crane.<br>

Fabrication and Assembly<br>
The assembly shop is divided into four areas:<br>
- Panel Line<br>
- Curved Assembly<br>
- Sub-Assembly<br>
- Main Assembly<br>
<br>
Ahead of the panel line are two CNC buming machines each having <br>
dual plasma underwater cutting heads, one bevelling, capable of <br>
cutting 16m X 3.6m plates.<br>
<br>
The panel line is capable of producing flat panels up to 16m wide <br>
X 18m long (nominal).  The panel line consists of one sided <br>
welding machines, panel flame planers, automatic stiffener <br>
positioners, web fitting gantries, web welding gantries, <br>
workstations with ultra heavy lift systems, and a 280t loadout <br>
station.<br>
<br>
The curved assembly area incorporates mobile pin jigs&#39; serviced <br>
with stiffener and welding gantries.<br>
<br>
The sub-assembly area consists of a semi-automatic line served by <br>
tow semi-portal 10t cranes and a 20 t overhead hook crane.<br>
<br>
The main assembly area is where the smaller sub-assemblies are <br>
joined to form shaped units.  This area is served by tow 75t <br>
cranes and one 10t crane.<br>
<br>
Over and above this equipment are 1500t hydraulic rolls, a 500t <br>
hydraulic press and guillotine shears.<br>

                        PRESS RELEASE<br>
TEAMING UP FOR CANADA&#39;S EAST COAST OFFSHORE PROJECTS<br>
<br>
Canada&#39;s largest shipbuilder, Irving Shipbuilding Inc., and major <br>
international offshore contractor AMEC, have formed a strategic <br>
alliance to win work on future offshore developments on Canada&#39;s <br>
East Coast.<br>
<br>
The agreement creates a Canadian-led alliance, with the necessary <br>
skills and experience to provide clients with fully integrated <br>
solutions for offshore oil and gas projects.<br>
<br>
Irving Shipbuilding has major ship construction and fabrication <br>
facilities in Saint John, New Brunswick and Halifax, Nova Scotia. <br>
 The company is an experienced builder of offshore drilling <br>
support vessels, and fabricator of modules for offshore <br>
installations.  Irving Shipbuilding Inc. has a proven track <br>
record in building offshore drilling vessels, both <br>
semi-submersible and mono-hulled, having completed eight vessels <br>
for SEDCO Drilling and Bow Valley.  The company has also <br>
fabricated the drilling modules for the major Hibernia platform.<br>
<br>
AMED, Europe&#39;s most experienced offshore contractor, provides <br>
clients with a complete ``life of asset`` service for offshore <br>
developments.  Internationally, AMEC has been involved in major <br>
offshore projects as far afield as Brazil, China, and Australia.<br>
<br>
Andrew McArthur, Vice Chairman of Irving Shipbuilding Inc. said, <br>
``Both organizations are recognized as best in class&#39; in their <br>
respective fields and this alliance offers a particularly <br>
powerful combination for large or difficult offshore projects.``<br>
<br>
Neil Bruce, Managing Director of AMEC Offshore added, ``The great <br>
advantage of this Canadian led alliance is that it provides <br>
clients with world class solutions&#39; to offshore developments <br>
provided from a Canadian base.``<br>
<br>
AMEC Offshore Ltd., part of AMEC, the international capital <br>
projects, services and investment group which generated a <br>
turnover of £3.4 billion ($C7.8 billion) in 1998, employs 22,000 <br>
people worldwide.<br>
<br>
AMEC Offshore has over 25 years of international offshore <br>
experience having engineered 400,000 tonnes and fabricated over <br>
375,000 tonnes of offshore facilities and has provided 90 million <br>
manhours of offshore services.
