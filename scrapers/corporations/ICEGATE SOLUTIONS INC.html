                            Icegate Solutions has been engaged in all aspects of ICT issues on a Global basis for over 30 years and have been closely involved in the evolution of the sector throughout this period.  We have participated and led the development of models and processes that have contributed to Canadas reputation as a role model for connectivity and e-government. We provide strategic, regulatory, legislative framework, program evaluation, and technology expertise in ICT policy, strategy, planning and implementation; Universal Access; rural telecommunications; broadband; wireless; VOIP; and telecom carrier issues, as well as associated project management and strategic support.  <br>
<br>
Icegate has been actively engaged in developing ICT Sector policies for the past 10 years.  Our approach is to support a transparent and inclusive policy process, promoting fair and open competition, and strengthening institutional capacity to implement and enforce policies. Our efforts have enabled our clients to take advantage of new markets, enhance their business maturity, invest appropriately in research &amp; development, address regional demand, cultivate foreign investment, and improve the ICT labor market.  More specifically, we have developed a national ICT network cabling policy and regulations for wiring and cabling for commercial and government buildings that facilitated and encouraged development of the Botswana ICT sector, provided assistance with the creation of the Broadband for Rural Canada Program that provided incentives for the ICT Sector to become more engaged in providing ICT services in rural areas, developed a Universal Service Fund Program that provided policies and incentives to assist the further development of the ICT Sector and increase ICT access available in rural communities in Papua New Guinea, undertook a study of  Canadian Telecom Equipment Manufactures Global Value Chain, represented the Government of Canada and transferred Canadian ICT Sector capacity building experiences at the Capacity-Building Workshop for National and Sectoral ICT Strategies and Planning, developed ICT Sector development policy, strategy and services (telecom and broadband) rollout plans for rural villages in Botswana that included an ICT policy for diffusion of ICT capacity, and undertook a final evaluation for CIDA/Industry Canada sponsored ePol-NET Program. <br>
<br>
Our extensive expertise in strategic and technology planning and business case development, has evolved into a business decision support process, model and software tool that is especially effective in determining the economic feasibility (costs and appropriate plan of action) for the deployment of Universal Service, broadband and rural community networks. We consider business case assessments, sustainability, community aggregation, market forces, market and revenue sizing, traffic sizing, transport network architectures, the full range of technologies and scalability from community to national levels. We have researched broadband service markets that deal with the fundamental elements and economics of broadband services and address how they apply relative to the delivery of high speed Internet service to residential and business customers in currently unserved rural and remote areas.  We have also examined the ability of wireless spectrum alternatives to provide broadband (and narrowband where possible) services to unserved rural and remote communities.<br>
<br>
Our telecom consultants use their proven processes and procedures, as well as broad knowledge of existing and next generation network technology, to quickly and accurately assess network situations, effectively diagnose current problems, and anticipate future needs. We use a flexible, customized, engineering approach to meet customer&#39;s telecommunications and network needs. Our delivery and implementation services are structured and managed to focus on increasing the performance of processes, tools, technologies, and people.  Our expertise in technology analysis, development, design, integration, training, and management, ensures the highest levels of current network performance and reliability, while anticipating future business requirements.  <br>

<br>
Project Management <br>
<br>
We have specialized in Project Management of technology and policy related projects for over 25 years, and have certified PMP (Project Management Professionals) project managers on staff.  Our extensive global experience includes managing projects for governments, public sector organizations and private sector corporations in North America, Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia.  We have managed many different projects that employed between 2 and 32 resources, lasting from 1 to 12 months, and delivering as many as 15 deliverables for a project.  The deliverables have included program evaluations, business and financial analysis, business cases, case studies, organization reviews, procurement, e-government and telecommunication policies, public programs, technology and management strategies, IT system development and implementation, telecommunication services and networks, and technical and business problem resolution.<br>
<br>
ICT (Information Communications Technologies)<br>
<br>
Icegate Solutions has been engaged in all aspects of ICT issues for almost 30 years and have been closely involved in the evolution of the sector throughout this period.  We have participated and led the development of models and processes that have contributed to Canadas reputation as a role model for connectivity and e-government. We provide strategic, regulatory, legislative framework, program evaluation, and technology expertise in ICT policy, strategy, planning and implementation; Universal Access; rural telecommunications; broadband; wireless; VOIP; and telecom carrier issues, as well as associated project management and strategic support.  <br>
<br>
Our extensive expertise in strategic and technology planning and business case development, has evolved into a business decision support process and model that is especially effective in determining the costs and appropriate plan of action for the deployment of Universal Service, broadband and rural community networks. We consider the full range of technologies, are able to scale from community to national levels, predict sustainability, and predict where market forces will likely be directed and deployed. We have researched broadband service markets that deal with the fundamental elements and economics of broadband services and address how they apply relative to the delivery of high speed Internet service to residential and business customers in currently unserved rural and remote areas.  We have also examined the ability of wireless spectrum alternatives to provide broadband (and narrowband where possible) services to unserved rural and remote communities.<br>
<br>
Icegate has developed a software tool that assists to determine the economic feasibility of projects that provide transport networks in support of telecommunication access to communities. The tool addresses such things as business case assessments, sustainability, community aggregation, market and revenue sizing, traffic sizing, transport network architectures and technology costs.  <br>
<br>
Our telecom consultants use their proven processes and procedures, as well as broad knowledge of existing and next generation network technology, to quickly and accurately assess network situations, effectively diagnose current problems, and anticipate future needs. We use a flexible, customized, engineering approach to meet customer&#39;s telecommunications and network needs. Our delivery and implementation services are structured and managed to focus on increasing the performance of processes, tools, technologies, and people.  Our expertise in technology analysis, development, design, integration, training, and management, ensures the highest levels of current network performance and reliability, while anticipating future business requirements.  <br>

                            Icegate Solutions has been engaged in all aspects of ICT issues on a Global basis for over 30 years and have been closely involved in the evolution of the sector throughout this period.  We have participated and led the development of models and processes that have contributed to Canadas reputation as a role model for connectivity and e-government. We provide strategic, regulatory, legislative framework, program evaluation, and technology expertise in ICT policy, strategy, planning and implementation; Universal Access; rural telecommunications; broadband; wireless; VOIP; and telecom carrier issues, as well as associated project management and strategic support.  <br>
<br>
Icegate has been actively engaged in developing ICT Sector policies for the past 10 years.  Our approach is to support a transparent and inclusive policy process, promoting fair and open competition, and strengthening institutional capacity to implement and enforce policies. Our efforts have enabled our clients to take advantage of new markets, enhance their business maturity, invest appropriately in research &amp; development, address regional demand, cultivate foreign investment, and improve the ICT labor market.  More specifically, we have developed a national ICT network cabling policy and regulations for wiring and cabling for commercial and government buildings that facilitated and encouraged development of the Botswana ICT sector, provided assistance with the creation of the Broadband for Rural Canada Program that provided incentives for the ICT Sector to become more engaged in providing ICT services in rural areas, developed a Universal Service Fund Program that provided policies and incentives to assist the further development of the ICT Sector and increase ICT access available in rural communities in Papua New Guinea, undertook a study of  Canadian Telecom Equipment Manufactures Global Value Chain, represented the Government of Canada and transferred Canadian ICT Sector capacity building experiences at the Capacity-Building Workshop for National and Sectoral ICT Strategies and Planning, developed ICT Sector development policy, strategy and services (telecom and broadband) rollout plans for rural villages in Botswana that included an ICT policy for diffusion of ICT capacity, and undertook a final evaluation for CIDA/Industry Canada sponsored ePol-NET Program. <br>
<br>
Our extensive expertise in strategic and technology planning and business case development, has evolved into a business decision support process, model and software tool that is especially effective in determining the economic feasibility (costs and appropriate plan of action) for the deployment of Universal Service, broadband and rural community networks. We consider business case assessments, sustainability, community aggregation, market forces, market and revenue sizing, traffic sizing, transport network architectures, the full range of technologies and scalability from community to national levels. We have researched broadband service markets that deal with the fundamental elements and economics of broadband services and address how they apply relative to the delivery of high speed Internet service to residential and business customers in currently unserved rural and remote areas.  We have also examined the ability of wireless spectrum alternatives to provide broadband (and narrowband where possible) services to unserved rural and remote communities.<br>
<br>
Our telecom consultants use their proven processes and procedures, as well as broad knowledge of existing and next generation network technology, to quickly and accurately assess network situations, effectively diagnose current problems, and anticipate future needs. We use a flexible, customized, engineering approach to meet customer&#39;s telecommunications and network needs. Our delivery and implementation services are structured and managed to focus on increasing the performance of processes, tools, technologies, and people.  Our expertise in technology analysis, development, design, integration, training, and management, ensures the highest levels of current network performance and reliability, while anticipating future business requirements.  <br>

Operating since 2001 and incorporated in Canada since 2002, Icegate focuses on 6 core areas  Project Management, ICT (Information Communications Technologies), Policy/Governance/Legislative Frameworks, IT solutions, GIS and Management Consulting.

The results speak for themselves - Icegate successfully delivers quality solutions to clients on multiple occasions around the globe.<br>
<br>
Project Management <br>
<br>
We have specialized in Project Management of technology and policy related projects for over 25 years, and have certified PMP (Project Management Professionals) project managers on staff.  Our extensive global experience includes managing projects for governments, public sector organizations and private sector corporations in North America, Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia.  We have managed many different projects that employed between 2 and 32 resources, lasting from 1 to 12 months, and delivering as many as 15 deliverables for a project.  The deliverables have included program evaluations, business and financial analysis, business cases, case studies, organization reviews, procurement, e-government and telecommunication policies, public programs, technology and management strategies, IT system development and implementation, telecommunication services and networks, and technical and business problem resolution.<br>
<br>
ICT (Information Communications Technologies)<br>
<br>
Icegate Solutions has been engaged in all aspects of ICT issues for almost 30 years and have been closely involved in the evolution of the sector throughout this period.  We have participated and led the development of models and processes that have contributed to Canadas reputation as a role model for connectivity and e-government. We provide strategic, regulatory, legislative framework, program evaluation, and technology expertise in ICT policy, strategy, planning and implementation; Universal Access; rural telecommunications; broadband; wireless; VOIP; and telecom carrier issues, as well as associated project management and strategic support.  <br>
<br>
Our extensive expertise in strategic and technology planning and business case development, has evolved into a business decision support process and model that is especially effective in determining the costs and appropriate plan of action for the deployment of Universal Service, broadband and rural community networks. We consider the full range of technologies, are able to scale from community to national levels, predict sustainability, and predict where market forces will likely be directed and deployed. We have researched broadband service markets that deal with the fundamental elements and economics of broadband services and address how they apply relative to the delivery of high speed Internet service to residential and business customers in currently unserved rural and remote areas.  We have also examined the ability of wireless spectrum alternatives to provide broadband (and narrowband where possible) services to unserved rural and remote communities.<br>
<br>
Icegate has developed a software tool that assists to determine the economic feasibility of projects that provide transport networks in support of telecommunication access to communities. The tool addresses such things as business case assessments, sustainability, community aggregation, market and revenue sizing, traffic sizing, transport network architectures and technology costs.  <br>
<br>
Our telecom consultants use their proven processes and procedures, as well as broad knowledge of existing and next generation network technology, to quickly and accurately assess network situations, effectively diagnose current problems, and anticipate future needs. We use a flexible, customized, engineering approach to meet customer&#39;s telecommunications and network needs. Our delivery and implementation services are structured and managed to focus on increasing the performance of processes, tools, technologies, and people.  Our expertise in technology analysis, development, design, integration, training, and management, ensures the highest levels of current network performance and reliability, while anticipating future business requirements.  <br>
<br>

We are engaged with multinational companies and senior government officials on a variety of projects and programs in Africa, Asian Pacific and North America.
