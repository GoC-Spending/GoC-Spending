                            Our talented engineers are carefully chosen not just for their experience and technical skills, but also their incredible musicianship. And there are no egos here!<br>
<br>
After 20 years in the biz, we&#39;ve learned that the best performances come from providing the most comfortable and supportive atmosphere. We love working with all kinds of people - no matter what the project.<br>
<br>
Whether you are recording a full band CD, film ADR, voice-overs, singer-songwriter productions, or even tape transfers and digital conversions, you will always get first-generation versions of your projects. The result? a clearer and cleaner sound on TV, radio, CD and film.<br>
<br>
We can then master your CD with ISRC codes, proper track indexing, and furnish you with a master disc and track list printout. All you have to do send your masterpiece to the CD duplication plant.<br>

I love working with Rich at Digital Sound Magic! He&#39;s always friendly and helpful, and puts the team at ease that our voiceover will be professional, delivered on time (or before) and within budget.<br>

I recorded the audiobooks of two of my novels, SINGING SONGS, and GEMMA with Richard Dolmat at his DIGITAL SOUND MAGIC STUDIOS.  It was a new experience for me, putting my books on tape and I don&#39;t think I would have done half as good a job if it hadn&#39;t been for Richard&#39;s sensitive, caring, insightful feedback.  To top it off, his skill and expertise on the technical side of things, meant the sound quality of the finished product was GREAT!<br>

I worked with Digital Sound on a series of complicated Stargate and Highlander recording sessions involving linking up studios in Canada and England. They were upbeat, professional and vital in making the recordings work, and their technical expertise was absolutely on the money.<br>

Working with Richard and his crew at Digital Sound was a great experience. Richard went out of his way to try and make my life easier, which, given the scope of our project and short time frame, was VERY much appreciated.<br>
Richard (and the gang) were also very flexible scheduling wise, which was also very much appreciated as we were working with multiple people at once, all of whom had different and ever changing schedules themselves. It really felt like everyone was really working as a team.<br>
At the time of our project, we were actually working with 3 studios simultaneously in order to complete the massive project on timeand Digital Sound was my favorite studio to visit. I always felt welcomed when I came by. In fact, I was so comfortable that I often spent more time there than I really needed to. I also know that the talent was very happy with everyone at the studio.<br>
We will most definitely work with Digital Sound again...and again!<br>

It has been a pleasure to work with Digital Sound Magic. They have always been friendly and professional and I would recommend any company looking for voice talents to check out Digital Sound Magic!<br>

Digital Sound Magic was involved in music composition and sound mastering for our video. They have done a fantastic job taking our project from a somewhat vague idea through to reality. They have shown patience, professionalism, and talent throughout the project and has given the music that extra touch that was needed to make it fantastic.

                            Our talented engineers are carefully chosen not just for their experience and technical skills, but also their incredible musicianship. And there are no egos here!<br>
<br>
After 20 years in the biz, we&#39;ve learned that the best performances come from providing the most comfortable and supportive atmosphere. We love working with all kinds of people - no matter what the project.<br>
<br>
Whether you are recording a full band CD, film ADR, voice-overs, singer-songwriter productions, or even tape transfers and digital conversions, you will always get first-generation versions of your projects. The result? a clearer and cleaner sound on TV, radio, CD and film.<br>
<br>
We can then master your CD with ISRC codes, proper track indexing, and furnish you with a master disc and track list printout. All you have to do send your masterpiece to the CD duplication plant.<br>

              Jessica Rivers<br>

I love working with Rich at Digital Sound Magic! He&#39;s always friendly and helpful, and puts the team at ease that our voiceover will be professional, delivered on time (or before) and within budget.<br>
<br>
<br>
Meg Tilly<br>
Actress and Author<br>
I recorded the audiobooks of two of my novels, SINGING SONGS, and GEMMA with Richard Dolmat at his DIGITAL SOUND MAGIC STUDIOS.  It was a new experience for me, putting my books on tape and I don&#39;t think I would have done half as good a job if it hadn&#39;t been for Richard&#39;s sensitive, caring, insightful feedback.  To top it off, his skill and expertise on the technical side of things, meant the sound quality of the finished product was GREAT!<br>
<br>
<br>
Paul Spragg<br>
Producers&#39; Assistant at Big Finish Productions<br>
I worked with Digital Sound on a series of complicated Stargate and Highlander recording sessions involving linking up studios in Canada and England. They were upbeat, professional and vital in making the recordings work, and their technical expertise was absolutely on the money.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dawn Thomas<br>
Rouxbe Cooking School<br>
Working with Richard and his crew at Digital Sound was a great experience. Richard went out of his way to try and make my life easier, which, given the scope of our project and short time frame, was VERY much appreciated.<br>
Richard (and the gang) were also very flexible scheduling wise, which was also very much appreciated as we were working with multiple people at once, all of whom had different and ever changing schedules themselves. It really felt like everyone was really working as a team.<br>
At the time of our project, we were actually working with 3 studios simultaneously in order to complete the massive project on timeand Digital Sound was my favorite studio to visit. I always felt welcomed when I came by. In fact, I was so comfortable that I often spent more time there than I really needed to. I also know that the talent was very happy with everyone at the studio.<br>
We will most definitely work with Digital Sound again...and again!<br>
<br>

It has been a pleasure to work with Digital Sound Magic. They have always been friendly and professional and I would recommend any company looking for voice talents to check out Digital Sound Magic!<br>
<br>

Thomas S.<br>
MPI Software (Calgary)<br>
Digital Sound Magic was involved in music composition and sound mastering for our video. They have done a fantastic job taking our project from a somewhat vague idea through to reality. They have shown patience, professionalism, and talent throughout the project and has given the music that extra touch that was needed to make it fantastic.
