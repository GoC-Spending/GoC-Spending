        <br>            ITS NO LONGER BUSINESS AS USUAL<br><br>In todays economic environment, every dollar counts. For companies that export or import goods or services, that dollar has a different value each day. These changes in currency values create risks which must be managed and mitigated.  However, these changes also create opportunities which benefit those companies that understand the impact of movements on not only their their own business, but on the markets in which they operate,and on the companies they work with or the companies they compete against.  <br><br>As a full service Currency Management consultant, we not only help manage and mitigate currency risks, we help our clients achieve a more fundamentally robust understanding of their business and take on a more effective approach to currency management.  This enhances the entire financial well-being of the company from budgeting and marketing efforts through sales or procurement, ultimately supporting better and more stable returns.  <br><br>MANAGING THE RISK<br><br>No one can control currency values.  But companies can control how currency movements affect their business.

                            FX risk management aims first at identifying corporate FX risk exposure and then setting out the appropriate rules and procedures to manage that risk in a way that is consistent with the corporate risk appetite and culture.  One foundation of FX risk management is to develop a system that provides reasonable expectations, reducing surprises or unforeseen implications to the bottom line.<br>

Castle Currency goes well beyond providing daily ranges or targets or predictions as to where the market will be days, weeks, or months down the line. What Castle Currency offers is a portfolio of strategies  and their component tactics and tools  to moderate the impact of currency fluctuations. This gives clients precise action directives to make them more in control over these movements. You can incorporate our strategies into your business yourself, or you can have us customize the strategies specific to your business.  <br>
<br>
Castle Currency offers varying levels of our strategies to ensure they meet your needs.  <br>
<br>
Basic Strategies<br>
 This level of service will provide you with access to our multiple strategies delivered via website or email.  There are 4 strategies to provide diversification and to help you suit your needs.  These strategies are all designed based solely on historical currency movements.  <br>
<br>
Custom Strategies<br>
 This level of service will provide custom tailored strategies to meet the needs of your business operations and profit targets.  This will consider timing issues, magnitudes of risk, individual projects, your annual budget, and profit margin targets.   The aim of these strategies will be to have them more closely related to your risk/reward goals.  <br>
<br>
Custom Strategies to Achieve Annual Budget/ Profit Margins<br>
 This level of service will custom tailor our strategies to meet the needs of your business and will also constantly be checked against the budget forecast and ensure that a minimum profit margin level is maintained.  Should profits margins decline to the minimum threshold steps will be taken to neutralize the risk for the remaining budget period to ensure the minimum profit margin is always protected.  <br>

                            A good Currency Risk Management Plan (CRMP) is critical to the sound risk management for any business and is paramount to ensure the successful implementation of a currency risk management strategy.  <br>
<br>
Most small to mid-sized companies operate without a Currency Risk Management Plan (CRMP).  Decisions are often made ad-hoc and generally without any consistency, accountability or gauge to measure effects.  The absence of a plan, and resources to execute one, often has the effect of mismanagement of an exposure leading companies to believe that the policy to do nothing is the best for them.  But ignoring the risk wont make it go away.  <br>
<br>
Castle Currency Management will fully develop, or assist your company to develop a CRMP that can be successfully implemented.  Rules, guidelines and procedures are developed and followed.  The CRMP can be used to improve or establish the company currency risk management policy.  With a Currency Risk Management Plan, tailored to your company you will be more aware, proactive and in-control of currency risk. <br>

                            Corporations with multiple branches and offices face additional challenges when it comes to foreign currency exchange and risk management.  Castle Currency is uniquely positioned to assist in both the coordination and risk management of your currency needs.   <br>
<br>
When your company has multiple locations each responsible for conducting their own foreign exchange transactions complexities and inefficiencies can unnecessarily erode profit margins.  <br>
<br>
Castle Currency can pool your foreign exchange dealings into a centralized fully managed operation.  This would reduce the dollar volume of transactions by matching offsetting transactions and moving money internally between the separate offices instead of conducting two exchanges and paying commissions.  This could also benefit costs by reducing the amount of smaller transactions each office may undertake.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line is improved management of money plus a better monitoring of the companys entire currency exposure at any give time.  <br>

                            Conducting business internationally in which foreign currencies are used automatically creates risks to businesses.  Businesses can even have currency risks without crossing borders if competitors are international or if products they deal in are based in US Dollars.  Unmanaged risk can lead to significant losses to the bottom line, loss of competitive advantages, reduction in revenues, or financial distress of the company.  Identifying these risks is the first step to effectively managing them.  <br>
<br>
CCM reviews corporate operations to determine areas of currency risk exposure, timing, and current methods used in currency exchange, reporting, and risk management. <br>
<br>
Castle Currency Management will work with your company to onduct currency risk profiles to identify and confirm areas and relative magnitude of both straightforward and complex risks.  Timing issues, as well as the existence and magnitude of risk off-sets are examined.  <br>
 <br>
Net risks are identified and quantified in a foreign exchange risk profile which would be used in the development of a sound Currency Risk Management Plan.  It is important that the exposure managed is the correct amount.  You cant manage what you dont measure.  This should be periodically reviewed to ensure the proper amount, neither too much, nor too little is being managed.  This will prevent adding undesirable risk.  If error is large, reducing the timeline should be considered.  <br>
<br>
CCM can provide risk audits on existing Currency Risk Management Plans, company operations, company financials, including audit of internal controls.  As an outside consultant we can review procedures without bias and help identify any weakness in protocols which can lead to potential errors or deliberate manipulations.<br>

CCM runs sensitivity analyses on different currency ranges to help define important triggers for your company.  We can help you incorporate these into a managed plan which can provide an answer to the affects a currency move would have on your company at any time.  <br>

                            To be most effective currency risk management strategies should be used coupled with the annual or multiyear budgets, profit margin targets, or other financial measures.  In other words, there needs to be clearly defined goals.  CCM can help by custom tailoring our strategies to meet your goals.  <br>
<br>
Margin Protection/Threshold Risk  The hedging process is closely monitored and guided by company margin and profitability requirements/targets.  The goal is to maximize potential profit while setting a floor margin acceptable to your company.  CCM can work from specific currency floor price which is established as your minimum acceptable profit level or can also utilize the maximum percentage change the currency effect will have on your company.  <br>
<br>
Annual or Multi-Year Budget   The hedging process is closely monitored and guided by company budget requirements/targets.  The goal is to meet or exceed the budget expectations without any downside surprises.  As the budget progresses, CCM will alter hedging strategies and amounts to accommodate cash flows, changes to budget expectations and currency movements. If during the budget period, the minimum acceptable budget occurs, the full remainder of any risk will be neutralized. At the end of the budget period all hedging strategies will have been wound down.  <br>

                            Castle Currency can design new reporting methods and procedures or review existing ones.  <br>
Executed hedges and account statements require verification to ensure proper execution and allocation.  Support services are provided in this function, acting as a double check to prevent errors from occurring.  <br>
<br>
1.	Daily reconciliation:  CCM will verify the daily reports provide by your company.  This is an important task to ensure that the correct amounts are being managed.  CCM will assist to ensure directives from board of directors are met.  <br>
<br>
2.	Monthly reports: CCM will provide monthly reports to summarize the currency impact and existing positions aimed at measuring and reporting the effectiveness of risk management activities in achieving the objective of stabilizing returns and enhancing margins. <br>
<br>
3.	Proper FX Accounting Procedures: Uniform FX accounting procedures, booking procedures, and multicurrency general ledgers are required for all FX transactions.  Realized FX hedges need to be reconciled in the appropriate accounting periods and ensure all outstanding hedges follow the selected method of accounting.<br>

                            Though it is impossible to be correct all the time, you can greatly improve your profit margins by taking action at better rates each time you make a conversion and hedging more of your risk at far better rates.  Our currency experts have a finger on the pulse of the market and can pinpoint key levels to take action and have a valuable perspective on current market direction.  This is what Castle Currency excels at and how we add the most value to our clients.  We dont try to forecast where the currency will be 6 or 12 months from now (we dont have a crystal ball), we analyze the current trends and watch for key areas where it might stop and turn around.  We determine what rate is best to place your forwards out 6 to 12 months.  <br>

                            FX risk management aims first at identifying corporate FX risk exposure and then setting out the appropriate rules and procedures to manage that risk in a way that is consistent with the corporate risk appetite and culture.  One foundation of FX risk management is to develop a system that provides reasonable expectations, reducing surprises or unforeseen implications to the bottom line.<br>

Castle Currency goes well beyond providing daily ranges or targets or predictions as to where the market will be days, weeks, or months down the line. What Castle Currency offers is a portfolio of strategies  and their component tactics and tools  to moderate the impact of currency fluctuations. This gives clients precise action directives to make them more in control over these movements. You can incorporate our strategies into your business yourself, or you can have us customize the strategies specific to your business.  <br>
<br>
Castle Currency offers varying levels of our strategies to ensure they meet your needs.  <br>
<br>
Basic Strategies<br>
 This level of service will provide you with access to our multiple strategies delivered via website or email.  There are 4 strategies to provide diversification and to help you suit your needs.  These strategies are all designed based solely on historical currency movements.  <br>
<br>
Custom Strategies<br>
 This level of service will provide custom tailored strategies to meet the needs of your business operations and profit targets.  This will consider timing issues, magnitudes of risk, individual projects, your annual budget, and profit margin targets.   The aim of these strategies will be to have them more closely related to your risk/reward goals.  <br>
<br>
Custom Strategies to Achieve Annual Budget/ Profit Margins<br>
 This level of service will custom tailor our strategies to meet the needs of your business and will also constantly be checked against the budget forecast and ensure that a minimum profit margin level is maintained.  Should profits margins decline to the minimum threshold steps will be taken to neutralize the risk for the remaining budget period to ensure the minimum profit margin is always protected.  <br>

                            A good Currency Risk Management Plan (CRMP) is critical to the sound risk management for any business and is paramount to ensure the successful implementation of a currency risk management strategy.  <br>
<br>
Most small to mid-sized companies operate without a Currency Risk Management Plan (CRMP).  Decisions are often made ad-hoc and generally without any consistency, accountability or gauge to measure effects.  The absence of a plan, and resources to execute one, often has the effect of mismanagement of an exposure leading companies to believe that the policy to do nothing is the best for them.  But ignoring the risk wont make it go away.  <br>
<br>
Castle Currency Management will fully develop, or assist your company to develop a CRMP that can be successfully implemented.  Rules, guidelines and procedures are developed and followed.  The CRMP can be used to improve or establish the company currency risk management policy.  With a Currency Risk Management Plan, tailored to your company you will be more aware, proactive and in-control of currency risk. <br>

                            Corporations with multiple branches and offices face additional challenges when it comes to foreign currency exchange and risk management.  Castle Currency is uniquely positioned to assist in both the coordination and risk management of your currency needs.   <br>
<br>
When your company has multiple locations each responsible for conducting their own foreign exchange transactions complexities and inefficiencies can unnecessarily erode profit margins.  <br>
<br>
Castle Currency can pool your foreign exchange dealings into a centralized fully managed operation.  This would reduce the dollar volume of transactions by matching offsetting transactions and moving money internally between the separate offices instead of conducting two exchanges and paying commissions.  This could also benefit costs by reducing the amount of smaller transactions each office may undertake.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line is improved management of money plus a better monitoring of the companys entire currency exposure at any give time.  <br>

                            Conducting business internationally in which foreign currencies are used automatically creates risks to businesses.  Businesses can even have currency risks without crossing borders if competitors are international or if products they deal in are based in US Dollars.  Unmanaged risk can lead to significant losses to the bottom line, loss of competitive advantages, reduction in revenues, or financial distress of the company.  Identifying these risks is the first step to effectively managing them.  <br>
<br>
CCM reviews corporate operations to determine areas of currency risk exposure, timing, and current methods used in currency exchange, reporting, and risk management. <br>
<br>
Castle Currency Management will work with your company to onduct currency risk profiles to identify and confirm areas and relative magnitude of both straightforward and complex risks.  Timing issues, as well as the existence and magnitude of risk off-sets are examined.  <br>
 <br>
Net risks are identified and quantified in a foreign exchange risk profile which would be used in the development of a sound Currency Risk Management Plan.  It is important that the exposure managed is the correct amount.  You cant manage what you dont measure.  This should be periodically reviewed to ensure the proper amount, neither too much, nor too little is being managed.  This will prevent adding undesirable risk.  If error is large, reducing the timeline should be considered.  <br>
<br>
CCM can provide risk audits on existing Currency Risk Management Plans, company operations, company financials, including audit of internal controls.  As an outside consultant we can review procedures without bias and help identify any weakness in protocols which can lead to potential errors or deliberate manipulations.<br>

CCM runs sensitivity analyses on different currency ranges to help define important triggers for your company.  We can help you incorporate these into a managed plan which can provide an answer to the affects a currency move would have on your company at any time.  <br>

                            To be most effective currency risk management strategies should be used coupled with the annual or multiyear budgets, profit margin targets, or other financial measures.  In other words, there needs to be clearly defined goals.  CCM can help by custom tailoring our strategies to meet your goals.  <br>
<br>
Margin Protection/Threshold Risk  The hedging process is closely monitored and guided by company margin and profitability requirements/targets.  The goal is to maximize potential profit while setting a floor margin acceptable to your company.  CCM can work from specific currency floor price which is established as your minimum acceptable profit level or can also utilize the maximum percentage change the currency effect will have on your company.  <br>
<br>
Annual or Multi-Year Budget   The hedging process is closely monitored and guided by company budget requirements/targets.  The goal is to meet or exceed the budget expectations without any downside surprises.  As the budget progresses, CCM will alter hedging strategies and amounts to accommodate cash flows, changes to budget expectations and currency movements. If during the budget period, the minimum acceptable budget occurs, the full remainder of any risk will be neutralized. At the end of the budget period all hedging strategies will have been wound down.  <br>

                            Though it is impossible to be correct all the time, you can greatly improve your profit margins by taking action at better rates each time you make a conversion and hedging more of your risk at far better rates.  Our currency experts have a finger on the pulse of the market and can pinpoint key levels to take action and have a valuable perspective on current market direction.  This is what Castle Currency excels at and how we add the most value to our clients.  We dont try to forecast where the currency will be 6 or 12 months from now (we dont have a crystal ball), we analyze the current trends and watch for key areas where it might stop and turn around.  We determine what rate is best to place your forwards out 6 to 12 months.  <br>
