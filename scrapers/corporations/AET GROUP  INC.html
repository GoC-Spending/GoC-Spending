                            A waste audit is an inventory and composition analysis of an organizations waste stream.  It can identify what types of materials an organization generates and how much of each type is recovered through diversion programs or discarded.  AET’s waste auditors provide independent and unbiased audits that  help organizations ranging from municipalities to industry plan and design more efficient waste programs, reduce air, ground and water pollution and conserve natural resources.  AET’s waste auditing team has completed over 700 waste audit studies across Canada for a variety of sectors including all levels of government, manufacturing, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, school boards, commercial buildings and industrial facilities.<br>

                            The proper planning, implementation and reporting of sustainability initiatives has become an essential and expected aspect of managing an organization. Sustainability refers to the interdependency between economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social considerations. Sustainability has emerged as one of the most important business concepts of our time, and is relevant to organizations of any type (for profit, non-profit, government), any size, and in any sector of the economy.<br>
<br>
From cost savings, innovative new products or services, increased employee retention, and strengthened brand and reputation, viewing your organization through a sustainability lens uncovers possibilities that have previously gone unnoticed. Do you have an idea of the true scope of sustainable possibilities available to your organization? Do you need help transforming these possibilities into reality?<br>

                            AET has extensive experience providing compliance and non-compliance services in all aspects of air quality including greenhouse gas emissions, dispersion modeling, and indoor air quality.<br>
<br>
Greenhouse gases (GHG) are one of the most important performance metrics used to assess an organization&#39;s sustainability management. A robust and well-planned GHG inventory and management system will position your organization with a defensible set of data to effectively respond to requests for GHG information from your stakeholders. AET has developed GHG management systems for clients ranging in size from single-location facilities to major multi-national companies following the guidelines set forth in the leading global frameworks, including ISO 14064 and the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol. AET also has extensive experience in other aspects of GHG management including development of carbon offset projects, strategic planning pertaining to climate change, life cycle carbon footprint assessments, and third-party verification of GHG emissions and project reductions . <br>
<br>
In addition to our GHG expertise, AET manages and conducts both ambient and indoor air quality monitoring as part of environmental remediation projects.  As part of ECA compliance monitoring, AET technicians deploy various types of monitoring equipment to assess discharges from mitigation equipment into the natural environment.  Vapour intrusion and mitigation assessment is another aspect of AET’s expertise.  AET has conducted indoor air sampling programs in commercial, industrial and residential properties to assess the efficacy of vapour intrusion mitigation equipment.  Results of sampling undergo QA/QC and are communicated directly with property owners and with regulators, as appropriate.<br>

              Ian Cook Construction implemented a Construction Solid Waste Management Plan designed by AET for the Lutherwood Communities Project in Waterloo, Canada.  The plan resulted in an overall waste diverion of 76% through waste minimization, reuse, on-site source separation and recycling of construction bi-products.  Ian Cook Construction was awarded an Outstanding Environmental Sustainability Award from the Recycling Council of Ontario for their environmental stewardship and management role on the Lutherwood Communities project.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Stewardship Ontario has retained AET Consultants on a number of occasions over the past year and a half to work on municipal waste/recycling projects funded through our Effectiveness &amp; Efficiency Fund, a grant program that works to help Ontario municipalities reduce costs and increase the tonnes of Blue Box waste recovered.<br>
<br>
AET Consultants has completed several projects for Stewardship Ontario, including Single-Family<br>
Waste Composition Audits in the Town of Blue Mountains and Simcoe County, and Multi- Residential Waste Composition Audits in the City of Toronto and Peel Region.  These audits provide valuable information on residential waste generation and diversion rates for communities across the province.<br>
<br>
AET Consultants attention to detail and accuracy in planning and performing waste audit studies has enabled us to confidently set steward fees and measure Blue Box performance and identify target materials as directed in the Blue Box Plan.<br>
<br>
In addition to the residential waste composition audits, AET Consultants was selected as the lead consultant on the York Region Collection and Processing Optimization Study.  This project involved gathering quantitative and qualitative information about compacting recyclables in communities in<br>
York Region and over 50 other communities across North America.  The impacts of various compaction rates on material recovery efficiency were evaluated by AET Consultants through a series of audits at York Regions MRF.<br>
<br>
AET Consultants has consistently performed in a professional manner providing Stewardship<br>
Ontario with detailed, accurate and valuable data in a timely fashion.<br>
<br>
I recommend AET Consultants to you without reservation. Sincerely,<br>
<br>
John Dixie<br>

Over the past year, AET Consultants has provided waste consulting services for York Region and as such, I am pleased to provide this letter of reference.<br>
<br>
In 2006, York Region commissioned numerous waste studies to evaluate the performance of our blue box program and the results of these studies will lead to significant improvements to our overall system.   These studies included:<br>
	Town of Schomberg Residential Composition Waste Audit <br>
	Single Stream Blue Box Waste Composition Audit: York Region versus Non-York Region materials<br>
	Mixed Broken Glass Composition Audit<br>
	Background Study on Compaction of Blue Box Recyclables<br>
	Waste Composition Audit on Compaction of Blue Box Recyclables and MRF Optimization Study<br>
<br>
AET Consultants professionalism, quality of work and timeliness of reports all met with York Regions expectations and objectives of these studies.  York Region is very pleased with the work AET Consultants has done for us over the past year and will be our first choice for future consulting work.<br>

The Continuous Improvement Fund (CIF) is a program developed through a partnership among the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the City of Toronto, Stewardship Ontario and Waste Diversion Ontario. Its mandate is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Ontario’s municipal Blue Box recycling program. Since 2008, the CIF has provided over $62 million in funding to various projects across the Province of Ontario.<br>
<br>
As Manager (2008-2012) and Director (2012-present) of the CIF, I have worked with Larry Freiburger and Ben Dunbar of AET Group Inc., on several studies. These studies have included various residential and material recovery facility composition audits, recycling participation studies, and equipment performance audits in over 12 municipalities across Ontario. The information gained from these studies is used to analyze program performance, identify possible best practices in residential recycling and evaluate the outcome of CIF funded projects.<br>
<br>
Ben, Larry and their waste team at AET Group are recognized as experts in the waste &amp; recycling consulting sector, particularly with respect to composition analysis.<br>

Stewardship Ontario is a not-for-profit organization funded and governed by the industries that are the brand owners, first importers or franchisors of the products and packaging materials managed under our recycling programs. Stewardship Ontario operates the Blue Box - the curbside recycling program for printed paper and packaging and the Orange Drop Program- the recycling and safe disposal program for hazardous or special waste.<br>
<br>
Larry Freiburger and Ben Dunbar of AET Group Inc., have been retained by Stewardship Ontario as waste/recycling composition consultants on numerous projects since 2006.    These studies have included various residential and material recovery facility audits in over 15 municipalities across Ontario (in many cases these are recurring studies over a number of months/years), gathering waste generation and diversion data using precise prescribed audit methodologies. This data is used for various purposes within Stewardship Ontario, including fee setting, and ongoing diversion target monitoring.  Since Stewardship Ontario handles more than $100 million in annual steward fees, the credibility and consistency of the data used is critical in administering the programs.   Larry and Ben, through AET Group Inc., have used their expertise in waste and recycling composition studies to consistently deliver reliable results to Stewardship Ontario.<br>

AET provided waste and visual audit services for Niagara Region, as part of  its 2010-11 Waste Composition Study, and as such, I am pleased to provide this letter of reference.<br>
<br>
In 2010-11, Niagara Region commissioned AET to conduct a series of four, seasonal, single-family household waste audits in each municipality of Niagara Region.  AET was responsible for collecting, sorting and classifying the waste materials and providing reports to Niagara Region.<br>
<br>
In addition, AET was responsible for conducting a series of two visual audits of curbside set-outs and distributing an &#39;Awards&#39; door hanger to designated households, and providing a report to the Region, as part of Niagara Region&#39;s &#39;It Takes Three&#39; campaign.<br>
<br>
Finally, AET prepared a comprehensive trend analysis, which incorporated the 2010-11 audit results and analysis with Niagara Region&#39;s previous waste audit results, as well as compared the results from similar medium/large Ontario municipalities.  <br>
<br>
AET&#39;s staff, led by Project Coordinator, Ben Dunbar, demonstrated professionalism with their quality of work and timeliness of reports, which met with Niagara Region&#39;s expectations and objectives of this Study.  The staff was experienced, knowledgeable, effective and efficient.  Niagara Region was very pleased with the work provided on this Study.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

Program Manager, Waste Policy &amp; Planning<br>

AET has worked collaboratively with SNC-Lavalin carrying out waste audits for seven health care facilities operated by Shared Services West situated in Halton, Peel and the west end of Toronto.<br>
<br>
Over the course of the project work, AET staff performed all necessary tasks in a professional, courteous and timely manner to ensure the successful completion of the project.  The satisfaction of the client resulted in a sole sourced bid to provide similar services at other health care facilities that they manage.<br>
<br>
For this project, AET served as the lead in carrying out the waste audits under less than ideal circumstances which required special provisions to address the following:<br>
- hazards associated with handling biomedical and other hazardous materials commingled with non-hazardous waste materials<br>
- insufficient space within the facilities to store and sort the materials<br>
- logistics of material collection in large hospitals<br>
<br>
We enjoyed working with AET and look forward to further opportunities to do so.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
<br>

Over the past three years JEC has found AET Consultants to be extremely professional and courteous providing very effective and efficient waste audit services. AET Consultants have demonstrated a great deal of knowledge within their respective fields of service and have always provided very detailed and extensive reports that have proven to be extremely valuable.

“Our relationship with AET has been extremely beneficial to our environmental success. If it wasn&#39;t for the services provided to us from AET, we would have never won a gold waste reduction award from the Recycling Council of Ontario in 2009. The onsite service given by AET is completed in a professional manner that does not affect our daily operations. The AET staff is courteous and very knowledgeable when it comes to waste diversion. The final report has been a major key to our success. The final report is detailed enough for us to focus on certain waste classes for each department within our facility.”<br>

“Thank you for the audit services your company has provided to the Town of Richmond Hill. We found your team to be both approachable and very professional in their approach to the waste studies. They were completely self sufficient in setting up and recording information, and we were impressed by the level of detail they went to in order to determine exact weight measurements in each of the waste categories. We found the services of AET Consultants to be excellent, and we would be pleased to recommend them for their waste auditing services.”<br>

“I am pleased to offer this recommendation on behalf of AET, one of our audit compliance consultants.  I have been acquainted with AET since 2005, after they won the contract to conduct a gap analysis of the conformance of the Northstar Aerospace (Canada) Milton facility.  During that time I was able to observe AET’s professional skills as well as their interaction with regulators and subcontractors.  I found that they are committed to consistently provide superior efforts with professional end products in a timely manner and within the estimated budgets.  Overall, AET delivered the report on time and included a presentation to management to discuss their findings.  The prepared document has been a valuable continuous improvement tool for the Milton facility.  In short, I would recommend AET for further environmental compliance work.”<br>

                            A waste audit is an inventory and composition analysis of an organizations waste stream.  It can identify what types of materials an organization generates and how much of each type is recovered through diversion programs or discarded.  AET’s waste auditors provide independent and unbiased audits that  help organizations ranging from municipalities to industry plan and design more efficient waste programs, reduce air, ground and water pollution and conserve natural resources.  AET’s waste auditing team has completed over 700 waste audit studies across Canada for a variety of sectors including all levels of government, manufacturing, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, school boards, commercial buildings and industrial facilities.<br>

                            The proper planning, implementation and reporting of sustainability initiatives has become an essential and expected aspect of managing an organization. Sustainability refers to the interdependency between economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social considerations. Sustainability has emerged as one of the most important business concepts of our time, and is relevant to organizations of any type (for profit, non-profit, government), any size, and in any sector of the economy.<br>
<br>
From cost savings, innovative new products or services, increased employee retention, and strengthened brand and reputation, viewing your organization through a sustainability lens uncovers possibilities that have previously gone unnoticed. Do you have an idea of the true scope of sustainable possibilities available to your organization? Do you need help transforming these possibilities into reality?<br>

                            AET has extensive experience providing compliance and non-compliance services in all aspects of air quality including greenhouse gas emissions, dispersion modeling, and indoor air quality.<br>
<br>
Greenhouse gases (GHG) are one of the most important performance metrics used to assess an organization&#39;s sustainability management. A robust and well-planned GHG inventory and management system will position your organization with a defensible set of data to effectively respond to requests for GHG information from your stakeholders. AET has developed GHG management systems for clients ranging in size from single-location facilities to major multi-national companies following the guidelines set forth in the leading global frameworks, including ISO 14064 and the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol. AET also has extensive experience in other aspects of GHG management including development of carbon offset projects, strategic planning pertaining to climate change, life cycle carbon footprint assessments, and third-party verification of GHG emissions and project reductions . <br>
<br>
In addition to our GHG expertise, AET manages and conducts both ambient and indoor air quality monitoring as part of environmental remediation projects.  As part of ECA compliance monitoring, AET technicians deploy various types of monitoring equipment to assess discharges from mitigation equipment into the natural environment.  Vapour intrusion and mitigation assessment is another aspect of AET’s expertise.  AET has conducted indoor air sampling programs in commercial, industrial and residential properties to assess the efficacy of vapour intrusion mitigation equipment.  Results of sampling undergo QA/QC and are communicated directly with property owners and with regulators, as appropriate.<br>

              Ian Cook Construction implemented a Construction Solid Waste Management Plan designed by AET for the Lutherwood Communities Project in Waterloo, Canada.  The plan resulted in an overall waste diverion of 76% through waste minimization, reuse, on-site source separation and recycling of construction bi-products.  Ian Cook Construction was awarded an Outstanding Environmental Sustainability Award from the Recycling Council of Ontario for their environmental stewardship and management role on the Lutherwood Communities project.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Stewardship Ontario has retained AET Consultants on a number of occasions over the past year and a half to work on municipal waste/recycling projects funded through our Effectiveness &amp; Efficiency Fund, a grant program that works to help Ontario municipalities reduce costs and increase the tonnes of Blue Box waste recovered.<br>
<br>
AET Consultants has completed several projects for Stewardship Ontario, including Single-Family<br>
Waste Composition Audits in the Town of Blue Mountains and Simcoe County, and Multi- Residential Waste Composition Audits in the City of Toronto and Peel Region.  These audits provide valuable information on residential waste generation and diversion rates for communities across the province.<br>
<br>
AET Consultants attention to detail and accuracy in planning and performing waste audit studies has enabled us to confidently set steward fees and measure Blue Box performance and identify target materials as directed in the Blue Box Plan.<br>
<br>
In addition to the residential waste composition audits, AET Consultants was selected as the lead consultant on the York Region Collection and Processing Optimization Study.  This project involved gathering quantitative and qualitative information about compacting recyclables in communities in<br>
York Region and over 50 other communities across North America.  The impacts of various compaction rates on material recovery efficiency were evaluated by AET Consultants through a series of audits at York Regions MRF.<br>
<br>
AET Consultants has consistently performed in a professional manner providing Stewardship<br>
Ontario with detailed, accurate and valuable data in a timely fashion.<br>
<br>
I recommend AET Consultants to you without reservation. Sincerely,<br>
<br>
John Dixie<br>

Over the past year, AET Consultants has provided waste consulting services for York Region and as such, I am pleased to provide this letter of reference.<br>
<br>
In 2006, York Region commissioned numerous waste studies to evaluate the performance of our blue box program and the results of these studies will lead to significant improvements to our overall system.   These studies included:<br>
	Town of Schomberg Residential Composition Waste Audit <br>
	Single Stream Blue Box Waste Composition Audit: York Region versus Non-York Region materials<br>
	Mixed Broken Glass Composition Audit<br>
	Background Study on Compaction of Blue Box Recyclables<br>
	Waste Composition Audit on Compaction of Blue Box Recyclables and MRF Optimization Study<br>
<br>
AET Consultants professionalism, quality of work and timeliness of reports all met with York Regions expectations and objectives of these studies.  York Region is very pleased with the work AET Consultants has done for us over the past year and will be our first choice for future consulting work.<br>

The Continuous Improvement Fund (CIF) is a program developed through a partnership among the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the City of Toronto, Stewardship Ontario and Waste Diversion Ontario. Its mandate is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Ontario’s municipal Blue Box recycling program. Since 2008, the CIF has provided over $62 million in funding to various projects across the Province of Ontario.<br>
<br>
As Manager (2008-2012) and Director (2012-present) of the CIF, I have worked with Larry Freiburger and Ben Dunbar of AET Group Inc., on several studies. These studies have included various residential and material recovery facility composition audits, recycling participation studies, and equipment performance audits in over 12 municipalities across Ontario. The information gained from these studies is used to analyze program performance, identify possible best practices in residential recycling and evaluate the outcome of CIF funded projects.<br>
<br>
Ben, Larry and their waste team at AET Group are recognized as experts in the waste &amp; recycling consulting sector, particularly with respect to composition analysis.<br>

Stewardship Ontario is a not-for-profit organization funded and governed by the industries that are the brand owners, first importers or franchisors of the products and packaging materials managed under our recycling programs. Stewardship Ontario operates the Blue Box - the curbside recycling program for printed paper and packaging and the Orange Drop Program- the recycling and safe disposal program for hazardous or special waste.<br>
<br>
Larry Freiburger and Ben Dunbar of AET Group Inc., have been retained by Stewardship Ontario as waste/recycling composition consultants on numerous projects since 2006.    These studies have included various residential and material recovery facility audits in over 15 municipalities across Ontario (in many cases these are recurring studies over a number of months/years), gathering waste generation and diversion data using precise prescribed audit methodologies. This data is used for various purposes within Stewardship Ontario, including fee setting, and ongoing diversion target monitoring.  Since Stewardship Ontario handles more than $100 million in annual steward fees, the credibility and consistency of the data used is critical in administering the programs.   Larry and Ben, through AET Group Inc., have used their expertise in waste and recycling composition studies to consistently deliver reliable results to Stewardship Ontario.<br>

AET provided waste and visual audit services for Niagara Region, as part of  its 2010-11 Waste Composition Study, and as such, I am pleased to provide this letter of reference.<br>
<br>
In 2010-11, Niagara Region commissioned AET to conduct a series of four, seasonal, single-family household waste audits in each municipality of Niagara Region.  AET was responsible for collecting, sorting and classifying the waste materials and providing reports to Niagara Region.<br>
<br>
In addition, AET was responsible for conducting a series of two visual audits of curbside set-outs and distributing an &#39;Awards&#39; door hanger to designated households, and providing a report to the Region, as part of Niagara Region&#39;s &#39;It Takes Three&#39; campaign.<br>
<br>
Finally, AET prepared a comprehensive trend analysis, which incorporated the 2010-11 audit results and analysis with Niagara Region&#39;s previous waste audit results, as well as compared the results from similar medium/large Ontario municipalities.  <br>
<br>
AET&#39;s staff, led by Project Coordinator, Ben Dunbar, demonstrated professionalism with their quality of work and timeliness of reports, which met with Niagara Region&#39;s expectations and objectives of this Study.  The staff was experienced, knowledgeable, effective and efficient.  Niagara Region was very pleased with the work provided on this Study.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

Program Manager, Waste Policy &amp; Planning<br>

AET has worked collaboratively with SNC-Lavalin carrying out waste audits for seven health care facilities operated by Shared Services West situated in Halton, Peel and the west end of Toronto.<br>
<br>
Over the course of the project work, AET staff performed all necessary tasks in a professional, courteous and timely manner to ensure the successful completion of the project.  The satisfaction of the client resulted in a sole sourced bid to provide similar services at other health care facilities that they manage.<br>
<br>
For this project, AET served as the lead in carrying out the waste audits under less than ideal circumstances which required special provisions to address the following:<br>
- hazards associated with handling biomedical and other hazardous materials commingled with non-hazardous waste materials<br>
- insufficient space within the facilities to store and sort the materials<br>
- logistics of material collection in large hospitals<br>
<br>
We enjoyed working with AET and look forward to further opportunities to do so.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
<br>

JEC has contracted the services of AET Consultants since 2007 for the purpose of performing annual waste audit activities. Over the past three years JEC has found AET Consultants to be extremely professional and courteous providing very effective and efficient waste audit services. AET Consultants have demonstrated a great deal of knowledge within their respective fields of service and have always provided very detailed and extensive reports that have proven to be extremely valuable.

“Our relationship with AET has been extremely beneficial to our environmental success. If it wasn&#39;t for the services provided to us from AET, we would have never won a gold waste reduction award from the Recycling Council of Ontario in 2009. The onsite service given by AET is completed in a professional manner that does not affect our daily operations. The AET staff is courteous and very knowledgeable when it comes to waste diversion. The final report has been a major key to our success. The final report is detailed enough for us to focus on certain waste classes for each department within our facility.”<br>

“Thank you for the audit services your company has provided to the Town of Richmond Hill. We found your team to be both approachable and very professional in their approach to the waste studies. They were completely self sufficient in setting up and recording information, and we were impressed by the level of detail they went to in order to determine exact weight measurements in each of the waste categories. We found the services of AET Consultants to be excellent, and we would be pleased to recommend them for their waste auditing services.”<br>

“I am pleased to offer this recommendation on behalf of AET, one of our audit compliance consultants.  I have been acquainted with AET since 2005, after they won the contract to conduct a gap analysis of the conformance of the Northstar Aerospace (Canada) Milton facility.  During that time I was able to observe AET’s professional skills as well as their interaction with regulators and subcontractors.  I found that they are committed to consistently provide superior efforts with professional end products in a timely manner and within the estimated budgets.  Overall, AET delivered the report on time and included a presentation to management to discuss their findings.  The prepared document has been a valuable continuous improvement tool for the Milton facility.  In short, I would recommend AET for further environmental compliance work.”<br>
