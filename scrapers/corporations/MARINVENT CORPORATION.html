                            Sensor Fusion Overview<br>
Marinvents patented sensor fusion technology is a completely new methodology for conducting sensor fusion, particularly for dissimilar sensors with heterogeneous spatial and temporal characteristics.  <br>
Marinvents sensor fusion software package uses advanced expert system methods to integrate the sensor data into an easily understood probability map that is presented to the operator in real time.<br>
Application Spaces<br>
	ASW<br>
	Target Detection<br>
	Target Tracking &amp; Surveillance<br>
<br>
Sensor Fusion Key Features <br>
	Marinvents sensor fusion package is available under flexible licensing terms:<br>
o	Either as  a patent license or <br>
o	As a software license <br>
o	Either exclusive or non-exclusive<br>
	Sensor models can be readily updated with customers own real-world sensor models<br>
	Marinvent can work with customers to tailor the system to customers needs and to integrate the software into the customers platform<br>
	Marinvent-designed probability map expert system implemented to aid operators in detection and tracking of targets<br>
	The probability map incorporates two novel heuristics:<br>
o	It subtracts the probability associated from any sensor which is not in contact with the target; and<br>
o	When a sensor loses contact with the target, it retains the probability data from the sensor in question, but with the probability diluted spatially according to the maximum anticipated speed of the target<br>
<br>
Sensor Fusion Benefits<br>
	Expert system algorithms provide operator with best estimate of a Target Of Interests (TOIs) position and velocity<br>
o	Takes the guesswork out of target location and tracking<br>
o	Results in reduction of localization time of an order of magnitude over raw data mode<br>
o	Results in a reduction of tracking errors of an order of magnitude over raw data mode<br>
o	Significant reduction in stress and workload for operators<br>
	Modular and flexible design means that the sensor fusion algorithms are independent of the physical sensor system, working on post-processed sensor data<br>
o	May be used with disparate sensors with dissimilar profiles<br>
	Provides customers with a readily-available discriminator over their competitors systems<br>
	Can be retrofit to existing systems<br>

                            APM Overview<br>
Shortcomings with existing Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) and ice detector technologies that are currently employed for aircraft continue to allow numerous aircraft accidents, particularly during or immediately after take-off, with iced or contaminated airfoils.<br>
Marinvents Patented APM is an airflow monitoring technology that accurately assesses the stress on an airfoil at the airfoil surface itself by measuring the airflow turbulence intensity, which directly correlates to the airfoils proximity to stall. The APM system is the only system that measures the state of the airflow over any airfoil surface in all phases of flight and in all weather conditions. The APM tells the pilot or avionics systems the margin of lift remaining to the stall for that airfoil even when it is iced, contaminated or degraded.<br>
Application Spaces<br>
	Green aircraft operation/efficiency in all weather conditions and phases of flight<br>
	Aircraft safety under icing, wing contamination and wing degradation conditions<br>
	Protection of airframe manufacturers to fight accident claims due to airframe loss under icing conditions<br>
	Aircraft safety during take-off roll and high speed stall conditions <br>
	Prevention of Unmanned Air Vehicle loss due to icing/contamination <br>
	Extension of UAS range and payload in cold climates<br>
<br>
APM Key Features <br>
	APM directly measures aerodynamic performance at the source<br>
o	The lifting surface of the airfoil (wing, tail, etc.)<br>
	Measures airflow turbulence intensity (R) resulting from boundary layer tripping / separation<br>
	Provides aircrew, UAS operators and avionics systems with vital information that is currently not available to them<br>
	Provides margin to stalls that occur for any reason<br>
o	Exceeding stall angle of attack<br>
o	Contamination at leading edge or lifting surface<br>
o	Mach buffet<br>
	Shows location of stall so pilot can take the appropriate action to recover<br>
o	Allows critical decisions to be made fast that can significantly improve safety &amp; survivability<br>
	Allows the vehicle to be flown in most efficient manner at all times and under all contamination / weather conditions<br>
o	By flying R<br>
	Allows for optimization of use of anti-ice and de-icing systems <br>
o	Use only when actually necessary<br>
	Allows for approach speeds to be optimized for actual real-time conditions to reduce brake wear<br>
<br>
APM Safety Benefits<br>
	Existing stall warning and ice detection systems provide little or no advanced warning of impending stall conditions and little useful information about the actual contamination conditions at the airfoil surfaces<br>
o	Crew has little time to react appropriately and little useful information to base the decision upon (causing accidents)<br>
	APM provides real-time data that provides pilots/avionics systems &amp; UAS operators much more<br>
o	Time to make appropriate decisions<br>
o	Information to use to make the best decisions<br>
o	Safety &amp; survivability<br>
	It has the potential to almost eliminate these accidents by providing significantly earlier warning<br>
APM Green Benefits<br>
	Current civilian and military aircraft (and UAS) have no means to measure aerodynamic performance at wings or stabilizers (stress on the airfoil)<br>
	APM provides real-time data that allows pilots/avionics systems to optimize the fuel spend based upon current, actual, airfoil conditions<br>
o	Less fuel used  better carbon footprint<br>
o	Less brake wear as a result of optimized landing speeds<br>
o	Lower cost of operations<br>
o	Provision of operational data that can help to determine optimal maintenance (cleaning, painting, etc.,) based on ROI<br>
	Since use of de-icing fluids significantly lowers airfoil efficiency, being able to only use such fluids when critical provides for huge cost and efficiency  savings<br>
o	APM is the only system that can accurately and effectively provide the necessary feedback to enable this optimization<br>

                            Services Overview<br>
Marinvents independent team of highly experienced staff makes it the ideal choice for training, services and consulting in the aerospace sector, regardless of the size and complexity of the project. Marinvent has fixed and rotary wing test pilots and independent TCCA DARs that hold current Flight Analyst, Flight Test, Software &amp; TSO delegations.<br>
Marinvent offers turn-key avionics flight-testing and certification through its come-as-you-are concept, which uses Marinvents Piaggio P-180 Avanti aircraft to save customers time &amp; money on flight test &amp; certification. The fully-instrumented aircraft, which can be flown as an Optionally Piloted Vehicle (OPV), also supports the rapid development, demonstration and evaluation of &quot;virtual&quot; avionics systems, which makes customers prototype technologies appear mature.<br>

                            Sensor Fusion Overview<br>
Marinvents patented sensor fusion technology is a completely new methodology for conducting sensor fusion, particularly for dissimilar sensors with heterogeneous spatial and temporal characteristics.  <br>
Marinvents sensor fusion software package uses advanced expert system methods to integrate the sensor data into an easily understood probability map that is presented to the operator in real time.<br>
Application Spaces<br>
	ASW<br>
	Target Detection<br>
	Target Tracking &amp; Surveillance<br>
<br>
Sensor Fusion Key Features <br>
	Marinvents sensor fusion package is available under flexible licensing terms:<br>
o	Either as  a patent license or <br>
o	As a software license <br>
o	Either exclusive or non-exclusive<br>
	Sensor models can be readily updated with customers own real-world sensor models<br>
	Marinvent can work with customers to tailor the system to customers needs and to integrate the software into the customers platform<br>
	Marinvent-designed probability map expert system implemented to aid operators in detection and tracking of targets<br>
	The probability map incorporates two novel heuristics:<br>
o	It subtracts the probability associated from any sensor which is not in contact with the target; and<br>
o	When a sensor loses contact with the target, it retains the probability data from the sensor in question, but with the probability diluted spatially according to the maximum anticipated speed of the target<br>
<br>
Sensor Fusion Benefits<br>
	Expert system algorithms provide operator with best estimate of a Target Of Interests (TOIs) position and velocity<br>
o	Takes the guesswork out of target location and tracking<br>
o	Results in reduction of localization time of an order of magnitude over raw data mode<br>
o	Results in a reduction of tracking errors of an order of magnitude over raw data mode<br>
o	Significant reduction in stress and workload for operators<br>
	Modular and flexible design means that the sensor fusion algorithms are independent of the physical sensor system, working on post-processed sensor data<br>
o	May be used with disparate sensors with dissimilar profiles<br>
	Provides customers with a readily-available discriminator over their competitors systems<br>
	Can be retrofit to existing systems<br>

                            APM Overview<br>
Shortcomings with existing Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) and ice detector technologies that are currently employed for aircraft continue to allow numerous aircraft accidents, particularly during or immediately after take-off, with iced or contaminated airfoils.<br>
Marinvents Patented APM is an airflow monitoring technology that accurately assesses the stress on an airfoil at the airfoil surface itself by measuring the airflow turbulence intensity, which directly correlates to the airfoils proximity to stall. The APM system is the only system that measures the state of the airflow over any airfoil surface in all phases of flight and in all weather conditions. The APM tells the pilot or avionics systems the margin of lift remaining to the stall for that airfoil even when it is iced, contaminated or degraded.<br>
Application Spaces<br>
	Green aircraft operation/efficiency in all weather conditions and phases of flight<br>
	Aircraft safety under icing, wing contamination and wing degradation conditions<br>
	Protection of airframe manufacturers to fight accident claims due to airframe loss under icing conditions<br>
	Aircraft safety during take-off roll and high speed stall conditions <br>
	Prevention of Unmanned Air Vehicle loss due to icing/contamination <br>
	Extension of UAS range and payload in cold climates<br>
<br>
APM Key Features <br>
	APM directly measures aerodynamic performance at the source<br>
o	The lifting surface of the airfoil (wing, tail, etc.)<br>
	Measures airflow turbulence intensity (R) resulting from boundary layer tripping / separation<br>
	Provides aircrew, UAS operators and avionics systems with vital information that is currently not available to them<br>
	Provides margin to stalls that occur for any reason<br>
o	Exceeding stall angle of attack<br>
o	Contamination at leading edge or lifting surface<br>
o	Mach buffet<br>
	Shows location of stall so pilot can take the appropriate action to recover<br>
o	Allows critical decisions to be made fast that can significantly improve safety &amp; survivability<br>
	Allows the vehicle to be flown in most efficient manner at all times and under all contamination / weather conditions<br>
o	By flying R<br>
	Allows for optimization of use of anti-ice and de-icing systems <br>
o	Use only when actually necessary<br>
	Allows for approach speeds to be optimized for actual real-time conditions to reduce brake wear<br>
<br>
APM Safety Benefits<br>
	Existing stall warning and ice detection systems provide little or no advanced warning of impending stall conditions and little useful information about the actual contamination conditions at the airfoil surfaces<br>
o	Crew has little time to react appropriately and little useful information to base the decision upon (causing accidents)<br>
	APM provides real-time data that provides pilots/avionics systems &amp; UAS operators much more<br>
o	Time to make appropriate decisions<br>
o	Information to use to make the best decisions<br>
o	Safety &amp; survivability<br>
	It has the potential to almost eliminate these accidents by providing significantly earlier warning<br>
APM Green Benefits<br>
	Current civilian and military aircraft (and UAS) have no means to measure aerodynamic performance at wings or stabilizers (stress on the airfoil)<br>
	APM provides real-time data that allows pilots/avionics systems to optimize the fuel spend based upon current, actual, airfoil conditions<br>
o	Less fuel used  better carbon footprint<br>
o	Less brake wear as a result of optimized landing speeds<br>
o	Lower cost of operations<br>
o	Provision of operational data that can help to determine optimal maintenance (cleaning, painting, etc.,) based on ROI<br>
	Since use of de-icing fluids significantly lowers airfoil efficiency, being able to only use such fluids when critical provides for huge cost and efficiency  savings<br>
o	APM is the only system that can accurately and effectively provide the necessary feedback to enable this optimization<br>

o	Regardless of how dynamically the platform on which they are located is moving with respect to the target<br>
o	Regardless of whether the target is static or fully dynamic<br>
	Allows the tactical system operator to remain constantly aware of his/her physical orientation <br>
o	By providing the situational awareness required to do so at all times<br>
	Enables considerably better communication between the tactical system operator and other crew in the vehicle<br>
o	Improving overall crew effectiveness and considerably reducing workload<br>
	Can be readily integrated with existing display software to enable the retrofit market<br>
