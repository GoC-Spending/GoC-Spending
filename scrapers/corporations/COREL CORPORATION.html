                            Favorite Features <br>
<br>
If you&#39;re a long-time Corel® Painter user, you can continue to enjoy the favorite features that have been the cornerstones of the application for years. Whether you&#39;re a commercial designer, artist or photographer, the following features let you leverage your natural talents and techniques to create original works of art, and they distinguish Corel Painter from other applications. <br>
<br>
Brushes<br>
<br>
Brushes are the heart and soul of Corel® Painter IX. There are more than 30 brush categories, ranging from crayons, chalk and charcoal to acrylics, watercolor, artists&#39; oils and liquid ink. While most brush categories mirror the look and feel of traditional brushes, others offer a one-of-a-kind creative tool. <br>
<br>
Brush Control palettes provide quick, easy access to the settings for every brush control. Brushes are organized into distinct categories, each featuring a multitude of variants. <br>
<br>
 Oil<br>
Oil brushes produce the effects expected from oil paints. All brush variants in this category cover underlying brush strokes, many are capable of multicolored strokes, and others interact with underlying pixels to create realistic effects. <br>
<br>
Watercolor<br>
Watercolor brush variants produce natural-looking watercolor effects. Almost all brush variants in the Watercolor category interact with the canvas texture. For most of these variants, stylus pressure affects the width of the brush stroke. As with traditional-media watercolor brushes, increased pressure widens a brush stroke and reduced pressure narrows a stroke. <br>
<br>
Cloners<br>
Painting with a cloner brush is similar to painting with any Corel Painter brush, except that cloner brush variants take their color information from a clone source, such as a pattern or another image, instead of from the Colors palette. Some cloner brush variants reproduce a source image directly. Other cloner brush variants reproduce a source image with low opacity and soft edges, or they use paper grain and specialized dabs for particular media effects.  <br>
<br>
Brush Creator<br>
Corel Painter IX offers a large and varied brush collection. In addition, you can customize your brushes. Brush Creator allows you to create custom brushes by providing three flexible options for designing a brush: a) randomly modify an existing brush, b) combine the characteristics of two brushes, or c) create a custom brush from scratch. <br>
<br>
Papers<br>
In the real world, an artist&#39;s brush or drawing tool produces different results when applied to surfaces with different textures. Corel Painter allows you to control the texture of the canvas to achieve the results you&#39;d expect from natural media on a given surface. Brushes interact with paper grain, just as natural tools react with the texture of the surfaces beneath them. <br>
<br>
Mixer Palette<br>
Colors not found in the Color palette can be created from scratch in the Mixer palette. This innovative feature includes tools, such as a brush and palette knife, designed specifically for painting and color mixing. With an Artists&#39; Oils brush, you can sample and use multiple colors in the same brush stroke. <br>
<br>
Animation<br>
Corel Painter has an impressive array of animation features. The Onion Skinning feature allows you to view previous and future frames while working on the current frame. The Rotoscoping feature enables you to paint and modify a single frame of an existing movie. Animated movies can be saved as animated GIFs, QuickTime® movies or AVI movies. <br>
<br>
Scripting<br>
Scripts allow actions to be recorded and played back, saving you time when performing the same operation on a collection of images. Scripts can be played back at any resolution, allowing you to automatically re-create high-resolution output from scripts recorded at low resolution. Scripts are also a great educational resource. Viewing a script of an artist&#39;s image-creation process is like looking through the artist&#39;s eyes. <br>
<br>
Support for Industry-standard File Formats<br>
Corel Painter IX lets you open and save Adobe® Photoshop® (PSD), TIFF (CMYK and RGB), Windows® Bitmap (BMP), PC Paintbrush (PCX), TARGA® (TGA), GIF, JPEG, Mac PICT, QuickTime (MOV), and Video for Windows (AVI) files. In addition, you can import and export Adobe® Illustrator® (AI) files. You can also save files in encapsulated PostScript® (EPS) format. <br>
<br>
Image Hose<br>
The Image Hose behaves like a brush, but it sprays images instead of applying paint. You can also load your own image or select an image from the library included in the application. <br>

                            ENHANCED! Drawing Assistance<br>
Corel Grafigo 2 provides new drawing aids, such as line straightening and alignment, symmetry recognition and snapping, that convert the shapes you draw into perfect forms. New shapes include arrows and trapezoids.<br>
<br>
NEW! Grab-It<br>
The Grab-It tool lets you cut out content from any application or Web site and bring it directly into Corel Grafigo 2, with only a couple taps of your pen.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Real-time collaboration<br>
Through Microsoft® Peer-to-Peer technology or Microsoft® NetMeeting®, Corel Grafigo 2 lets you collaborate with colleagues over the Internet, in real time. Changes made in one person&#39;s version of Corel Grafigo 2 can be seen immediately by all members of the collaboration session, saving time during group projects, brainstorming sessions and whenever input is required from multiple sources.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Onionskins<br>
A revolutionary way to review graphically rich projects, Onionskins are transparent overlays that let you add comments or changes to a graphic or drawing without altering the original. Onionskins are reusable and can be sent to another person. With Corel Grafigo 2, you can now show, hide, lock and unlock Onionskins, and use multiple Onionskins that overlap one another so you can view them independently.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Underlays<br>
You can now move, resize and delete underlays, including importing multi-page documents as separate underlays, which are then automatically added to the View Manager toolbar for easy access. With Corel Grafigo 2, you can import documents from any program installed on your Tablet PC that supports standard Windows OS print functionality.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Library Toolbar<br>
The new Library toolbar replaces the Symbols palette, allowing you to create reusable content from underlays, Onionskins, text frames and ink strokes, and organize content more easily with a new, intuitive workflow.<br>
<br>
NEW! E-mailing documents<br>
E-mail documents directly from Corel Grafigo 2.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! View Manager<br>
Save specific views while you&#39;re working and access them at any time using the View Manager toolbar<br>
<br>
NEW! Slide shows<br>
Save views as a slide show and open them in an SVG viewer. For multi-page documents, Corel Grafigo 2 also provides navigation controls that let you navigate through the views you&#39;ve defined.<br>
<br>
NEW! Navigator<br>
View document contents and navigate in documents more easily. Use the Navigator to pan to any area of the workspace with a tap of the pen, or auto-pan to move the document view in the direction you drag a selected object.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Ink strokes<br>
Resize and rotate ink strokes, and use the new Local Eraser tool to erase portions of an ink stroke.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Content selection<br>
Use the Pick and Lasso tools to select ink strokes, text frames and underlays with a tap of the pen, and grab anywhere within a selection to move the selected content. Plus, select and move content around the workspace with a single motion using the new Pick tool.<br>
<br>
NEW! Export preview<br>
Preview documents before you export them.<br>
<br>
NEW! Exchange information between programs<br>
Copy selected ink strokes from Corel Grafigo 2 and paste them into another program that supports ink. Or take selected ink strokes from a program that supports ink and insert them into Corel Grafigo 2.<br>

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency<br>
of the US Department of the Interior, and the US<br>
Department of Agriculture Forest Service administer<br>
millions of acres of America&#39;s public lands. It is the<br>
mission of both agencies to sustain the health,<br>
diversity, and productivity of public lands for the use<br>
and enjoyment of present and future generations<br>
through balanced used, conservation, environmental<br>
management, recreation opportunities and tourism.<br>
Increasingly, public lands are viewed from the<br>
perspective of the recreational opportunities they offer,<br>
their cultural resources and their abundant beauty.<br>
The BLM and USDA Forest Service must recognize the<br>
demands of public land users while continuing to<br>
address the issues of land conservation.<br>
The Roseburg District BLM and Umpqua National Forest<br>
border one other, thereby providing opportunities to<br>
collaborate in the development of brochures and other<br>
interpretive projects to showcase the vast recreational,<br>
scenic and tourist attractions of the region. A team<br>
effort with content contributors from both agencies<br>
create collateral pieces on a variety of subjects and<br>
recreational opportunities, including boating, camping,<br>
fishing, hiking, hunting, mountain biking, site-seeing,<br>
and visiting cultural or heritage sites.<br>
The area managed by both agencies contains dense<br>
forest heavily populated with cedar, Douglas-fir and<br>
hemlock. From the snow of the High Cascades to<br>
whitewater rapids and thundering waterfalls, dramatic<br>
scenery abounds. A wealth of rivers and streams<br>
weave through these forests, supporting sport fishing<br>
and contributing to commercial fish stocks. In addition,<br>
hundreds of miles of trails frequented by hikers,<br>
equestrians, and mountain bikers traverse the forests.<br>
One of those trails, The North Umpqua Trail, is<br>
managed by both the Roseburg District BLM and<br>
Umpqua National Forest. The trail closely follows the<br>
North Umpqua River as it winds through dense oldgrowth<br>
forests, along volcanic outcrops, and past<br>
tumbling waterfalls.<br>
To promote the 70-mile Nolrth Umqpua Trail,<br>
recreation planners for the Roseburg District BLM and<br>
Umpqua National Forest collaborated with Mary<br>
Breannan, graphic artist for the Umpqua NF. A longtime<br>
CorelDRAW aficionado, Brennan knew just the<br>
tool for the job. Ive used other graphics tools, she<br>
explains, but I always go back to CorelDRAW. It<br>
makes sense to me.<br>
The Solution<br>
After developing the brochures messaging, members<br>
of the group went out to the field to take photographs.<br>
Captured digitally and later touched up in Corel<br>
PHOTO-PAINT, scenic photography takes a prominent<br>
role in the 20-page double folded brochure. While she<br>
appreciates and often takes advantage of the ability<br>
Corel PHOTO-PAINT provides to manipulate images,<br>
Brennan also enjoys creating new graphics for such<br>
projects. Im comfortable enough with CorelDRAW<br>
to experiment, she explains. Ive been using it for<br>
10 years now, way back since version 3.<br>
For the North Umpqua Trail brochure, they decided<br>
to include educational information on the fish stocks<br>
that populate the river. To achieve this, Brennan<br>
combined informative text with illustrations created<br>
with CorelDRAW. Each page is a complete design,<br>
says Brennan. I can have fun choosing different color<br>
schemes, adding text or other images. And I never<br>
have to do the same thing twice.<br>
Using CorelDRAW Graphics Suite to create promotional<br>
materials provides many benefits to the Forest Service<br>
and Bureau of Land Management. Brennans level of<br>
familiarity with the application provides time- and costsaving<br>
opportunities. Its just so friendly, she explains,<br>
and Im so comfortable with it, its an extension of my<br>
hand. Brennan also lists PDF publishing, import and<br>
export filters, and the ability to share files with<br>
applications like Microsoft Word as invaluable to<br>
her workflow.<br>

The Benefits<br>
To gauge the success of a project like the North<br>
Umpqua Trail brochure, they usually rely on public<br>
feedback or the occasional award from the local<br>
chamber of commerce. These brochures are used<br>
nation-wide and we get lots of Wows!, explains<br>
Brennan. Sometimes people whove seen a brochure<br>
will call to say Thank you after theyve visited the area.<br>
Citing the joy of discovery as another benefit to using<br>
the application, Brennan likes finding new things that<br>
the application can do. I just stumbled upon the new<br>
Pen tool the other day, she explains, Now Im using<br>
it all the time.<br>

              U.S. Department of Justice Chooses WordPerfect Office 12<br>
<br>
DOJ Chooses World&#39;s Preferred Office Suite Alternative for Deployment on More Than 50,000 Seats, Citing Unique Functionality and Highly-Flexible Licensing <br>
<br>
Ottawa, Canada  March 7, 2005<br>
Corel Corporation today announced that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has entered into an agreement to license more than 50,000 seats with WordPerfect® Office 12, the latest version of Corel&#39;s award winning office suite. The DOJ&#39;s adoption of WordPerfect Office 12 marks one of the world&#39;s largest deployments of an alternative office suite across a single organization and reaffirms WordPerfect Office&#39;s status as the world&#39;s preferred alternative to Microsoft® Office.<br>
<br>
The customer win is a key milestone for WordPerfect Office, whose 2004 return to prominence in the office suite market has resulted in dramatically increased uptake among consumers, law offices and small businesses as well as with the government organizations for whom WordPerfect Office&#39;s licensing programs and enterprise-class feature set have been developed.<br>
<br>
Corel&#39;s Flexible Licensing Key to Win<br>
Best known for its uniquely powerful feature set and its industry-leading compatibility with Microsoft Office, WordPerfect Office 12 has been licensed by the Department of Justice on the strength of the product&#39;s feature set and flexible enterprise licensing program. Corel&#39;s licensing program provides the powerful capabilities of WordPerfect Office 12 at low prices and with flexible licensing terms that are geared to the budgets and real-world license administration needs of enterprise customers.<br>
<br>
&quot;The DOJ chose WordPerfect Office 12 because, quite simply, our users require it to do their job. In the courts, or among attorneys, it&#39;s the tool of choice for the legal arena,&quot; said Mary Aileen O&#39;Donovan, Program Manager for the Justice Management Division at the U.S. Department of Justice. &quot;Corel has consistently shown that they really understand how enterprise agreements should workwe pay once and then go forth in use. Corel understands our needs and that makes our life a lot easier.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Corel&#39;s WordPerfect Office 12 couples enterprise-class power with ease-of-use, support of open standards and flexible licensing terms. With an adaptable support infrastructure behind it, we can offer outstanding prices and support to our enterprise clients with one hand, while we provide the same to our small business and consumer customers with the other,&quot; said Richard Carriere, General Manager for office productivity at Corel. &quot;Corel flexibly responds to our customers&#39; budgetary, licensing and technical needs to ensure that every WordPerfect customer can achieve exceptionally low TCO and the technical support solutions that other low-cost office productivity tools simply can&#39;t offer today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Used by more than 20 million customers worldwide, WordPerfect Office 12 is the value-priced and feature-rich alternative to Microsoft Office, providing full-featured word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and address book applications. WordPerfect Office 12 is compatible with popular file formats, including Microsoft Office, PDF, HTML and XML, and allows customers to share files created in WordPerfect Office with users of other office productivity tools.<br>
<br>
WordPerfect Office 12 provides each licensed user with Home and Laptop privileges, giving employees licensed to use WordPerfect Office 12 at work the ability to use the same copy nonconcurrently at home or on their laptop. Other enterprise benefits include product maintenance and multilingual use.<br>
<br>
In addition to these standard features, enterprise license customers may also access customized, rapid-response technical services from Corel&#39;s enterprise support staff. Enterprise support services may range from customer-specific training to 3rd-party technology integration to customized XML solutions and more.<br>

              Continental Airlines<br>
Technical Publications department<br>
To produce both design and<br>
engineer-related material<br>
accurately, quickly and costeffectively<br>
CorelDRAW has enabled a<br>
department of designers to<br>
efficiently produce everything from<br>
FAA-regulated technical documents<br>
to animated web content<br>
Comprehensive graphics software<br>
helps Continental Airlines streamline<br>
communication and cut costs<br>
<br>
Continental Airlines is the world&#39;s seventh-largest<br>
airline and has more than 2,200 daily departures.<br>
With 130 domestic and 95 international destinations,<br>
Continental has the broadest global route network of<br>
any U.S. airline, including extensive service throughout<br>
the Americas, Europe and Asia. Continental has hubs<br>
serving New York, Houston, Cleveland and Guam, and<br>
carries approximately 41 million passengers per year<br>
on the newest jet fleet among major U.S. airlines. With<br>
48,000 employees, Continental is one of the 100 Best<br>
Companies to Work For in America. In 2003, Fortune<br>
ranked Continental highest among major U.S. carriers<br>
in the quality of its service and products, and No. 2 on<br>
its list of Most Admired Global Airlines.<br>
Continental produces a vast array of technical<br>
communication materials, ranging from technical<br>
manuals to marketing collateral. Accuracy, speed, and<br>
cost-effectiveness are all vital criteria in the production<br>
process. For example, when plane engines are repaired,<br>
all pertinent technical documentationvast amounts<br>
of itmust quickly and accurately reflect any<br>
mechanical changes. Otherwise, the plane sits empty<br>
on the tarmacand you can&#39;t afford that, said Rick<br>
Torres, Continental&#39;s CAD (Computer-aided Design)<br>
Supervisor of Technical Publications.<br>
Torres also explained that related documentation<br>
changes must be approved by both a Continental<br>
engineer and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration<br>
(FAA). As a result, Torres and his team of six designers<br>
supporting 40 technical writers and 80 engineers<br>
must be able to work swiftly under tight deadlines, to<br>
produce photographs, diagrams and drawings that<br>
meet detailed specifications.<br>
In addition, the department is responsible for creating<br>
in-flight placards, event banners, and, web animation.<br>
The production of such a wide range of materials<br>
requires not only the hard work of Continental&#39;s<br>
talented and dedicated co-workers, but also the<br>
support of a powerful and comprehensive suite of<br>
graphics software.<br>
Rick Torres and the designers at Continental use<br>
CorelDRAW , and have done so since Torres joined<br>
the company in 1993.<br>
We were still working with boards, using pen and<br>
ink, when we adopted CorelDRAW, Torres said.<br>
And though we&#39;ve since used other programs, in my<br>
mind there&#39;s no comparison between them and<br>
CorelDRAWwe absolutely rely on it to do our jobs.<br>
Torres explained that Continental has its own in-house<br>
printing facility, which lowers communication costs<br>
considerablyeven more so when combined with the<br>
graphic flexibility of tools such as CorelDRAW. No<br>
other program enables you to import and export a<br>
broader range of file types than CorelDRAW, Torres<br>
said. For file manipulation, it can&#39;t be beat.<br>
<br>
The Solution<br>
In my mind, there&#39;s no comparison between<br>
other graphics software and CorelDRAW<br>
we absolutely rely on it to do our jobs.<br>
Rick Torres,<br>
CAD Supervisor<br>
Continental Airlines<br>
CorelDRAW also cuts costs by reducing the time<br>
required by engineers and technical writers to manually<br>
produce or alter drawings Torres can do all of it on<br>
his desktop. For instance, for a couple of recent projects<br>
related to Boeing, (Boeing is Continental&#39;s manufacturer).<br>
Torres had to do a lot of photo-to-line art reproduction<br>
for maintenance manuals. The photos included details<br>
like frayed wires and chaffed aluminum that, for many<br>
other organizations, might be irrelevant, but in an<br>
aerospace environment are vital.<br>
It&#39;s critical that you reproduce those images so that<br>
all the elements within them are visible, Torres<br>
emphasized. CorelDRAW lets you do it.<br>
A great deal of the work done by the design team<br>
involves line-art representation and photo-to-line-art<br>
conversion. The number of wiring diagrams alone is<br>
staggering. Using intuitive CorelDRAW features such<br>
as the Polyline drawing tool, which combines line and<br>
freehand capabilities, designers are able to significantly<br>
streamline the work.<br>
Torres singled out the CorelDRAW clip art as being<br>
particularly helpful. In addition to providing an already<br>
extensive range of aerospace-related symbols, the<br>
program offers advanced Symbols support, a tool that<br>
enables designers to reduce the number of elements in<br>
their designs and re-use the most common ones.<br>
<br>
In doing so, designers save both file space and time.<br>
With the wiring diagrams, for example, Torres said,<br>
we don&#39;t have to continually build new symbols; they&#39;re<br>
already there, available to drag and drop as needed.<br>
While most of the graphics produced are print-related,<br>
the designers also create vector animation for the<br>
Continental website. The intuitive features of Corel<br>
R.A.V.E.Real Animated Vector Effects enable the<br>
designers to do everything from easily grouping and<br>
re-purposing animation, to previewing it in a web<br>
browser prior to launch.<br>
For Continental Airlines, the CorelDRAW Graphics<br>
Suite provides a powerful design platform that<br>
cost-effectively supports a near-endless array of<br>
communication products.<br>
Torres cited the example of the 672 FAA-mandated<br>
placards his database contains they relate to everything<br>
from seat configuration to safety procedures. The<br>
placards would cost roughly five dollars per piece to<br>
produce if outsourced. Torres designed most of them<br>
using CorelDRAW and, when needed, has them printed<br>
in-house. The cost per unit averages about 50 cents.<br>
Production quality is excellent, and cost savings are, in<br>
Torres&#39; words, cents to dollars.<br>

The Benefits<br>
No other program<br>
enables you to import<br>
and export a broader<br>
range of file types<br>
than CorelDRAW<br>

<br>
Keeping track of the traffic jungle:<br>
<br>
Berlin is teeming with activity. This is obvious not only<br>
to nocturnal revellers and visitors as they stroll by night<br>
along the Spree River, but also to the Integrated Public<br>
Transport Authority (BVG). Not surprisingly, Berlin&#39;s<br>
public transport system is an ongoing project: existing<br>
routes are improved, and new ones added. To stay at<br>
the forefront of technology, BVG was looking for<br>
graphic software tools equal to the task and selected<br>
Corel D .<br>
BVG is Germany&#39;s largest mass transit operator. With a<br>
growing fleet of buses, streetcars, subway trains and<br>
ships as well as 13,000 employees in customer servicerelated<br>
positions, BVG provides public transportation<br>
services to 800 million passengers a year.<br>
Presently, the Berlin public transport system, a network<br>
covering almost 1600 km, is made up of 9 subway,<br>
28 streetcar and 163 bus lines. Behind the scenes,<br>
countless technical drawings, train station surveys<br>
and safety protocols, as well as rail schematics, are<br>
required to manage and maintain existing and future<br>
facilities. In some cases, full-scale diagrams are a must.<br>
Until now, employees often created these network<br>
diagrams manually.<br>
ESIGNER 10<br>
To represent various rail lines on the same page and<br>
still differentiate between them, color-coding was<br>
used as a last resort. Considering the fact that plans<br>
measure between 50 and 100 cm and that they could<br>
hardly be computerized, this very elaborate exercise<br>
proved time-consuming and inefficient.<br>
Following the reunification of Germany and the<br>
restoration of Berlin&#39;s original rail network, BVG has<br>
been managing the S-Bahn (city and suburban railway).<br>
Since then, the transit operator had been searching for<br>
software that could help create technical illustrations<br>
for passenger traffic, network diagrams and signals.<br>
The ideal software would help visualize the complex<br>
transit system based on the existing paper model,<br>
while reducing training costs.<br>
This software had to fulfill other requirements. Most<br>
importantly, it would have to be user-friendly. Users<br>
should be able to create object-oriented technical<br>
diagrams that could be color-coded and copied, thus<br>
making it an efficient mass production tool. Layering,<br>
which is the definition of different levels and subsections,<br>
was another important requirement because it was<br>
necessary to plot anticipated variations and compare<br>
them with real-life situations. The new design solution<br>
also had to provide precision tools to account for<br>
To stay at the forefront of technology, BVG<br>
were looking for a comprehensive graphics<br>
software tool the right choice was<br>
Corel DESIGNER 10<br>

irregular curves and straight lines in horizontal and<br>
vertical arrangements. Likewise, a symbol library, as well<br>
as the ability to create and distinguish similar symbols,<br>
would result in increased efficiency, as symbol language<br>
is essential to traffic control systems. Since complex<br>
plans are mostly printed on plotters, support for large<br>
formats and the required plotters was a final criterion.<br>
At the beginning of 1984, BVG&#39;s IT systems consisted<br>
of a simple single platform. Today, it has a multi-server<br>
cluster system, a fully backed-up computer centre and<br>
a 100 MB TokenRing network with 16 MB client<br>
linking. Windows 2000 Server, NT 4 Clients, UNIX<br>
systems and Mac OS are used by almost all of the<br>
3,500 employees working on data technology.<br>
<br>
The Solution:<br>
The choice was Corel DESIGNER 10, a technical<br>
illustration tool specifically designed to meet the needs<br>
of organizations in both the public and private sectors.<br>
Corel DESIGNER allows for precision and scalability<br>
without overwhelming the user. The software is centrally<br>
deployed and used over a network. Employees quickly<br>
became familiar with the basic functions, and to date<br>
BVG has acquired 660 licenses.<br>
Corel DESIGNER 10 offers significant advantages. On a<br>
daily basis, variations in the layout of complex traffic<br>
flows and signalling systems can now be quickly and<br>
easily designed. Gone are the days of photocopies,<br>
glue and colored pencils. In particular, BVG has been<br>
relying on Corel DESIGNER to model the subway system.<br>
The use of technical drawings is by no means limited<br>
to BVG. The Berlin fire and police departments are<br>
making use of these surveys as well. Occasionally,<br>
architectural and engineering firms also require the<br>
technical illustrations.<br>
Overall, Corel DESIGNER 10 has met all BVG&#39;s<br>
expectations. Aside from being comprehensive and<br>
user-friendly, it allows users to create, manage and repurpose<br>
complex technical illustrations, diagrams and<br>
schematics.<br>
On a daily basis,<br>

signalling systems can<br>
now be quickly and<br>

                            Favorite Features <br>
<br>
If you&#39;re a long-time Corel® Painter user, you can continue to enjoy the favorite features that have been the cornerstones of the application for years. Whether you&#39;re a commercial designer, artist or photographer, the following features let you leverage your natural talents and techniques to create original works of art, and they distinguish Corel Painter from other applications. <br>
<br>
Brushes<br>
<br>
Brushes are the heart and soul of Corel® Painter IX. There are more than 30 brush categories, ranging from crayons, chalk and charcoal to acrylics, watercolor, artists&#39; oils and liquid ink. While most brush categories mirror the look and feel of traditional brushes, others offer a one-of-a-kind creative tool. <br>
<br>
Brush Control palettes provide quick, easy access to the settings for every brush control. Brushes are organized into distinct categories, each featuring a multitude of variants. <br>
<br>
 Oil<br>
Oil brushes produce the effects expected from oil paints. All brush variants in this category cover underlying brush strokes, many are capable of multicolored strokes, and others interact with underlying pixels to create realistic effects. <br>
<br>
Watercolor<br>
Watercolor brush variants produce natural-looking watercolor effects. Almost all brush variants in the Watercolor category interact with the canvas texture. For most of these variants, stylus pressure affects the width of the brush stroke. As with traditional-media watercolor brushes, increased pressure widens a brush stroke and reduced pressure narrows a stroke. <br>
<br>
Cloners<br>
Painting with a cloner brush is similar to painting with any Corel Painter brush, except that cloner brush variants take their color information from a clone source, such as a pattern or another image, instead of from the Colors palette. Some cloner brush variants reproduce a source image directly. Other cloner brush variants reproduce a source image with low opacity and soft edges, or they use paper grain and specialized dabs for particular media effects.  <br>
<br>
Brush Creator<br>
Corel Painter IX offers a large and varied brush collection. In addition, you can customize your brushes. Brush Creator allows you to create custom brushes by providing three flexible options for designing a brush: a) randomly modify an existing brush, b) combine the characteristics of two brushes, or c) create a custom brush from scratch. <br>
<br>
Papers<br>
In the real world, an artist&#39;s brush or drawing tool produces different results when applied to surfaces with different textures. Corel Painter allows you to control the texture of the canvas to achieve the results you&#39;d expect from natural media on a given surface. Brushes interact with paper grain, just as natural tools react with the texture of the surfaces beneath them. <br>
<br>
Mixer Palette<br>
Colors not found in the Color palette can be created from scratch in the Mixer palette. This innovative feature includes tools, such as a brush and palette knife, designed specifically for painting and color mixing. With an Artists&#39; Oils brush, you can sample and use multiple colors in the same brush stroke. <br>
<br>
Animation<br>
Corel Painter has an impressive array of animation features. The Onion Skinning feature allows you to view previous and future frames while working on the current frame. The Rotoscoping feature enables you to paint and modify a single frame of an existing movie. Animated movies can be saved as animated GIFs, QuickTime® movies or AVI movies. <br>
<br>
Scripting<br>
Scripts allow actions to be recorded and played back, saving you time when performing the same operation on a collection of images. Scripts can be played back at any resolution, allowing you to automatically re-create high-resolution output from scripts recorded at low resolution. Scripts are also a great educational resource. Viewing a script of an artist&#39;s image-creation process is like looking through the artist&#39;s eyes. <br>
<br>
Support for Industry-standard File Formats<br>
Corel Painter IX lets you open and save Adobe® Photoshop® (PSD), TIFF (CMYK and RGB), Windows® Bitmap (BMP), PC Paintbrush (PCX), TARGA® (TGA), GIF, JPEG, Mac PICT, QuickTime (MOV), and Video for Windows (AVI) files. In addition, you can import and export Adobe® Illustrator® (AI) files. You can also save files in encapsulated PostScript® (EPS) format. <br>
<br>
Image Hose<br>
The Image Hose behaves like a brush, but it sprays images instead of applying paint. You can also load your own image or select an image from the library included in the application. <br>

                            ENHANCED! Drawing Assistance<br>
Corel Grafigo 2 provides new drawing aids, such as line straightening and alignment, symmetry recognition and snapping, that convert the shapes you draw into perfect forms. New shapes include arrows and trapezoids.<br>
<br>
NEW! Grab-It<br>
The Grab-It tool lets you cut out content from any application or Web site and bring it directly into Corel Grafigo 2, with only a couple taps of your pen.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Real-time collaboration<br>
Through Microsoft® Peer-to-Peer technology or Microsoft® NetMeeting®, Corel Grafigo 2 lets you collaborate with colleagues over the Internet, in real time. Changes made in one person&#39;s version of Corel Grafigo 2 can be seen immediately by all members of the collaboration session, saving time during group projects, brainstorming sessions and whenever input is required from multiple sources.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Onionskins<br>
A revolutionary way to review graphically rich projects, Onionskins are transparent overlays that let you add comments or changes to a graphic or drawing without altering the original. Onionskins are reusable and can be sent to another person. With Corel Grafigo 2, you can now show, hide, lock and unlock Onionskins, and use multiple Onionskins that overlap one another so you can view them independently.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Underlays<br>
You can now move, resize and delete underlays, including importing multi-page documents as separate underlays, which are then automatically added to the View Manager toolbar for easy access. With Corel Grafigo 2, you can import documents from any program installed on your Tablet PC that supports standard Windows OS print functionality.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Library Toolbar<br>
The new Library toolbar replaces the Symbols palette, allowing you to create reusable content from underlays, Onionskins, text frames and ink strokes, and organize content more easily with a new, intuitive workflow.<br>
<br>
NEW! E-mailing documents<br>
E-mail documents directly from Corel Grafigo 2.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! View Manager<br>
Save specific views while you&#39;re working and access them at any time using the View Manager toolbar<br>
<br>
NEW! Slide shows<br>
Save views as a slide show and open them in an SVG viewer. For multi-page documents, Corel Grafigo 2 also provides navigation controls that let you navigate through the views you&#39;ve defined.<br>
<br>
NEW! Navigator<br>
View document contents and navigate in documents more easily. Use the Navigator to pan to any area of the workspace with a tap of the pen, or auto-pan to move the document view in the direction you drag a selected object.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Ink strokes<br>
Resize and rotate ink strokes, and use the new Local Eraser tool to erase portions of an ink stroke.<br>
<br>
ENHANCED! Content selection<br>
Use the Pick and Lasso tools to select ink strokes, text frames and underlays with a tap of the pen, and grab anywhere within a selection to move the selected content. Plus, select and move content around the workspace with a single motion using the new Pick tool.<br>
<br>
NEW! Export preview<br>
Preview documents before you export them.<br>
<br>
NEW! Exchange information between programs<br>
Copy selected ink strokes from Corel Grafigo 2 and paste them into another program that supports ink. Or take selected ink strokes from a program that supports ink and insert them into Corel Grafigo 2.<br>

              Umpqua National Forest<br>
Bureau of Land Management<br>

®<br>
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency<br>
of the US Department of the Interior, and the US<br>
Department of Agriculture Forest Service administer<br>
millions of acres of America&#39;s public lands. It is the<br>
mission of both agencies to sustain the health,<br>
diversity, and productivity of public lands for the use<br>
and enjoyment of present and future generations<br>
through balanced used, conservation, environmental<br>
management, recreation opportunities and tourism.<br>
Increasingly, public lands are viewed from the<br>
perspective of the recreational opportunities they offer,<br>
their cultural resources and their abundant beauty.<br>
The BLM and USDA Forest Service must recognize the<br>
demands of public land users while continuing to<br>
address the issues of land conservation.<br>
The Roseburg District BLM and Umpqua National Forest<br>
border one other, thereby providing opportunities to<br>
collaborate in the development of brochures and other<br>
interpretive projects to showcase the vast recreational,<br>
scenic and tourist attractions of the region. A team<br>
effort with content contributors from both agencies<br>
create collateral pieces on a variety of subjects and<br>
recreational opportunities, including boating, camping,<br>
fishing, hiking, hunting, mountain biking, site-seeing,<br>
and visiting cultural or heritage sites.<br>
The area managed by both agencies contains dense<br>
forest heavily populated with cedar, Douglas-fir and<br>
hemlock. From the snow of the High Cascades to<br>
whitewater rapids and thundering waterfalls, dramatic<br>
scenery abounds. A wealth of rivers and streams<br>
weave through these forests, supporting sport fishing<br>
and contributing to commercial fish stocks. In addition,<br>
hundreds of miles of trails frequented by hikers,<br>
equestrians, and mountain bikers traverse the forests.<br>
One of those trails, The North Umpqua Trail, is<br>
managed by both the Roseburg District BLM and<br>
Umpqua National Forest. The trail closely follows the<br>
North Umpqua River as it winds through dense oldgrowth<br>
forests, along volcanic outcrops, and past<br>
tumbling waterfalls.<br>
To promote the 70-mile Nolrth Umqpua Trail,<br>
recreation planners for the Roseburg District BLM and<br>
Umpqua National Forest collaborated with Mary<br>
Breannan, graphic artist for the Umpqua NF. A longtime<br>
CorelDRAW aficionado, Brennan knew just the<br>
tool for the job. Ive used other graphics tools, she<br>
explains, but I always go back to CorelDRAW. It<br>
makes sense to me.<br>
The Solution<br>
After developing the brochures messaging, members<br>
of the group went out to the field to take photographs.<br>
Captured digitally and later touched up in Corel<br>
PHOTO-PAINT, scenic photography takes a prominent<br>
role in the 20-page double folded brochure. While she<br>
appreciates and often takes advantage of the ability<br>
Corel PHOTO-PAINT provides to manipulate images,<br>
Brennan also enjoys creating new graphics for such<br>
projects. Im comfortable enough with CorelDRAW<br>
to experiment, she explains. Ive been using it for<br>
10 years now, way back since version 3.<br>
For the North Umpqua Trail brochure, they decided<br>
to include educational information on the fish stocks<br>
that populate the river. To achieve this, Brennan<br>
combined informative text with illustrations created<br>
with CorelDRAW. Each page is a complete design,<br>
says Brennan. I can have fun choosing different color<br>
schemes, adding text or other images. And I never<br>
have to do the same thing twice.<br>
Using CorelDRAW Graphics Suite to create promotional<br>
materials provides many benefits to the Forest Service<br>
and Bureau of Land Management. Brennans level of<br>
familiarity with the application provides time- and costsaving<br>
opportunities. Its just so friendly, she explains,<br>
and Im so comfortable with it, its an extension of my<br>
hand. Brennan also lists PDF publishing, import and<br>
export filters, and the ability to share files with<br>
applications like Microsoft Word as invaluable to<br>
her workflow.<br>
®<br>
The Benefits<br>
To gauge the success of a project like the North<br>
Umpqua Trail brochure, they usually rely on public<br>
feedback or the occasional award from the local<br>
chamber of commerce. These brochures are used<br>
nation-wide and we get lots of Wows!, explains<br>
Brennan. Sometimes people whove seen a brochure<br>
will call to say Thank you after theyve visited the area.<br>
Citing the joy of discovery as another benefit to using<br>
the application, Brennan likes finding new things that<br>
the application can do. I just stumbled upon the new<br>
Pen tool the other day, she explains, Now Im using<br>
it all the time.<br>
Id recommend CorelDRAW to anyone, especially if<br>
theyre starting from scratch, Brennan says. You can<br>
see what youre doing the whole time and its just so<br>
easy-to-use.<br>

              U.S. Department of Justice Chooses WordPerfect Office 12<br>
<br>
DOJ Chooses World&#39;s Preferred Office Suite Alternative for Deployment on More Than 50,000 Seats, Citing Unique Functionality and Highly-Flexible Licensing <br>
<br>
Ottawa, Canada  March 7, 2005<br>
Corel Corporation today announced that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has entered into an agreement to license more than 50,000 seats with WordPerfect® Office 12, the latest version of Corel&#39;s award winning office suite. The DOJ&#39;s adoption of WordPerfect Office 12 marks one of the world&#39;s largest deployments of an alternative office suite across a single organization and reaffirms WordPerfect Office&#39;s status as the world&#39;s preferred alternative to Microsoft® Office.<br>
<br>
The customer win is a key milestone for WordPerfect Office, whose 2004 return to prominence in the office suite market has resulted in dramatically increased uptake among consumers, law offices and small businesses as well as with the government organizations for whom WordPerfect Office&#39;s licensing programs and enterprise-class feature set have been developed.<br>
<br>
Corel&#39;s Flexible Licensing Key to Win<br>
Best known for its uniquely powerful feature set and its industry-leading compatibility with Microsoft Office, WordPerfect Office 12 has been licensed by the Department of Justice on the strength of the product&#39;s feature set and flexible enterprise licensing program. Corel&#39;s licensing program provides the powerful capabilities of WordPerfect Office 12 at low prices and with flexible licensing terms that are geared to the budgets and real-world license administration needs of enterprise customers.<br>
<br>
&quot;The DOJ chose WordPerfect Office 12 because, quite simply, our users require it to do their job. In the courts, or among attorneys, it&#39;s the tool of choice for the legal arena,&quot; said Mary Aileen O&#39;Donovan, Program Manager for the Justice Management Division at the U.S. Department of Justice. &quot;Corel has consistently shown that they really understand how enterprise agreements should workwe pay once and then go forth in use. Corel understands our needs and that makes our life a lot easier.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Corel&#39;s WordPerfect Office 12 couples enterprise-class power with ease-of-use, support of open standards and flexible licensing terms. With an adaptable support infrastructure behind it, we can offer outstanding prices and support to our enterprise clients with one hand, while we provide the same to our small business and consumer customers with the other,&quot; said Richard Carriere, General Manager for office productivity at Corel. &quot;Corel flexibly responds to our customers&#39; budgetary, licensing and technical needs to ensure that every WordPerfect customer can achieve exceptionally low TCO and the technical support solutions that other low-cost office productivity tools simply can&#39;t offer today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Used by more than 20 million customers worldwide, WordPerfect Office 12 is the value-priced and feature-rich alternative to Microsoft Office, providing full-featured word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and address book applications. WordPerfect Office 12 is compatible with popular file formats, including Microsoft Office, PDF, HTML and XML, and allows customers to share files created in WordPerfect Office with users of other office productivity tools.<br>
<br>
WordPerfect Office 12 provides each licensed user with Home and Laptop privileges, giving employees licensed to use WordPerfect Office 12 at work the ability to use the same copy nonconcurrently at home or on their laptop. Other enterprise benefits include product maintenance and multilingual use.<br>
<br>
In addition to these standard features, enterprise license customers may also access customized, rapid-response technical services from Corel&#39;s enterprise support staff. Enterprise support services may range from customer-specific training to 3rd-party technology integration to customized XML solutions and more.<br>
<br>
WordPerfect Office 12 is available at GSA schedule pricing via approved GSA resellers. GSA license pricing starts at $106 USD.<br>

              Continental Airlines<br>
Technical Publications department<br>
To produce both design and<br>
engineer-related material<br>
accurately, quickly and costeffectively<br>
CorelDRAW has enabled a<br>
department of designers to<br>
efficiently produce everything from<br>
FAA-regulated technical documents<br>
to animated web content<br>
Comprehensive graphics software<br>
helps Continental Airlines streamline<br>
communication and cut costs<br>
<br>
Continental Airlines is the world&#39;s seventh-largest<br>
airline and has more than 2,200 daily departures.<br>
With 130 domestic and 95 international destinations,<br>
Continental has the broadest global route network of<br>
any U.S. airline, including extensive service throughout<br>
the Americas, Europe and Asia. Continental has hubs<br>
serving New York, Houston, Cleveland and Guam, and<br>
carries approximately 41 million passengers per year<br>
on the newest jet fleet among major U.S. airlines. With<br>
48,000 employees, Continental is one of the 100 Best<br>
Companies to Work For in America. In 2003, Fortune<br>
ranked Continental highest among major U.S. carriers<br>
in the quality of its service and products, and No. 2 on<br>
its list of Most Admired Global Airlines.<br>
Continental produces a vast array of technical<br>
communication materials, ranging from technical<br>
manuals to marketing collateral. Accuracy, speed, and<br>
cost-effectiveness are all vital criteria in the production<br>
process. For example, when plane engines are repaired,<br>
all pertinent technical documentationvast amounts<br>
of itmust quickly and accurately reflect any<br>
mechanical changes. Otherwise, the plane sits empty<br>
on the tarmacand you can&#39;t afford that, said Rick<br>
Torres, Continental&#39;s CAD (Computer-aided Design)<br>
Supervisor of Technical Publications.<br>
Torres also explained that related documentation<br>
changes must be approved by both a Continental<br>
engineer and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration<br>
(FAA). As a result, Torres and his team of six designers<br>
supporting 40 technical writers and 80 engineers<br>
must be able to work swiftly under tight deadlines, to<br>
produce photographs, diagrams and drawings that<br>
meet detailed specifications.<br>
In addition, the department is responsible for creating<br>
in-flight placards, event banners, and, web animation.<br>
The production of such a wide range of materials<br>
requires not only the hard work of Continental&#39;s<br>
talented and dedicated co-workers, but also the<br>
support of a powerful and comprehensive suite of<br>
graphics software.<br>
Rick Torres and the designers at Continental use<br>
CorelDRAW , and have done so since Torres joined<br>
the company in 1993.<br>
We were still working with boards, using pen and<br>
ink, when we adopted CorelDRAW, Torres said.<br>
And though we&#39;ve since used other programs, in my<br>
mind there&#39;s no comparison between them and<br>
CorelDRAWwe absolutely rely on it to do our jobs.<br>
Torres explained that Continental has its own in-house<br>
printing facility, which lowers communication costs<br>
considerablyeven more so when combined with the<br>
graphic flexibility of tools such as CorelDRAW. No<br>
other program enables you to import and export a<br>
broader range of file types than CorelDRAW, Torres<br>
said. For file manipulation, it can&#39;t be beat.<br>
<br>
The Solution<br>
In my mind, there&#39;s no comparison between<br>
other graphics software and CorelDRAW<br>
we absolutely rely on it to do our jobs.<br>
Rick Torres,<br>
CAD Supervisor<br>
Continental Airlines<br>
CorelDRAW also cuts costs by reducing the time<br>
required by engineers and technical writers to manually<br>
produce or alter drawings Torres can do all of it on<br>
his desktop. For instance, for a couple of recent projects<br>
related to Boeing, (Boeing is Continental&#39;s manufacturer).<br>
Torres had to do a lot of photo-to-line art reproduction<br>
for maintenance manuals. The photos included details<br>
like frayed wires and chaffed aluminum that, for many<br>
other organizations, might be irrelevant, but in an<br>
aerospace environment are vital.<br>
It&#39;s critical that you reproduce those images so that<br>
all the elements within them are visible, Torres<br>
emphasized. CorelDRAW lets you do it.<br>
A great deal of the work done by the design team<br>
involves line-art representation and photo-to-line-art<br>
conversion. The number of wiring diagrams alone is<br>
staggering. Using intuitive CorelDRAW features such<br>
as the Polyline drawing tool, which combines line and<br>
freehand capabilities, designers are able to significantly<br>
streamline the work.<br>
Torres singled out the CorelDRAW clip art as being<br>
particularly helpful. In addition to providing an already<br>
extensive range of aerospace-related symbols, the<br>
program offers advanced Symbols support, a tool that<br>
enables designers to reduce the number of elements in<br>
their designs and re-use the most common ones.<br>
<br>
In doing so, designers save both file space and time.<br>
With the wiring diagrams, for example, Torres said,<br>
we don&#39;t have to continually build new symbols; they&#39;re<br>
already there, available to drag and drop as needed.<br>
While most of the graphics produced are print-related,<br>
the designers also create vector animation for the<br>
Continental website. The intuitive features of Corel<br>
R.A.V.E.Real Animated Vector Effects enable the<br>
designers to do everything from easily grouping and<br>
re-purposing animation, to previewing it in a web<br>
browser prior to launch.<br>
For Continental Airlines, the CorelDRAW Graphics<br>
Suite provides a powerful design platform that<br>
cost-effectively supports a near-endless array of<br>
communication products.<br>
Torres cited the example of the 672 FAA-mandated<br>
placards his database contains they relate to everything<br>
from seat configuration to safety procedures. The<br>
placards would cost roughly five dollars per piece to<br>
produce if outsourced. Torres designed most of them<br>
using CorelDRAW and, when needed, has them printed<br>
in-house. The cost per unit averages about 50 cents.<br>
Production quality is excellent, and cost savings are, in<br>
Torres&#39; words, cents to dollars.<br>

The Benefits<br>
No other program<br>
enables you to import<br>
and export a broader<br>
range of file types<br>
than CorelDRAW<br>

Keeping track of the traffic jungle:<br>
<br>
Berlin is teeming with activity. This is obvious not only<br>
to nocturnal revellers and visitors as they stroll by night<br>
along the Spree River, but also to the Integrated Public<br>
Transport Authority (BVG). Not surprisingly, Berlin&#39;s<br>
public transport system is an ongoing project: existing<br>
routes are improved, and new ones added. To stay at<br>
the forefront of technology, BVG was looking for<br>
graphic software tools equal to the task and selected<br>
Corel D .<br>
BVG is Germany&#39;s largest mass transit operator. With a<br>
growing fleet of buses, streetcars, subway trains and<br>
ships as well as 13,000 employees in customer servicerelated<br>
positions, BVG provides public transportation<br>
services to 800 million passengers a year.<br>
Presently, the Berlin public transport system, a network<br>
covering almost 1600 km, is made up of 9 subway,<br>
28 streetcar and 163 bus lines. Behind the scenes,<br>
countless technical drawings, train station surveys<br>
and safety protocols, as well as rail schematics, are<br>
required to manage and maintain existing and future<br>
facilities. In some cases, full-scale diagrams are a must.<br>
Until now, employees often created these network<br>
diagrams manually.<br>
ESIGNER 10<br>
To represent various rail lines on the same page and<br>
still differentiate between them, color-coding was<br>
used as a last resort. Considering the fact that plans<br>
measure between 50 and 100 cm and that they could<br>
hardly be computerized, this very elaborate exercise<br>
proved time-consuming and inefficient.<br>
Following the reunification of Germany and the<br>
restoration of Berlin&#39;s original rail network, BVG has<br>
been managing the S-Bahn (city and suburban railway).<br>
Since then, the transit operator had been searching for<br>
software that could help create technical illustrations<br>
for passenger traffic, network diagrams and signals.<br>
The ideal software would help visualize the complex<br>
transit system based on the existing paper model,<br>
while reducing training costs.<br>
This software had to fulfill other requirements. Most<br>
importantly, it would have to be user-friendly. Users<br>
should be able to create object-oriented technical<br>
diagrams that could be color-coded and copied, thus<br>
making it an efficient mass production tool. Layering,<br>
which is the definition of different levels and subsections,<br>
was another important requirement because it was<br>
necessary to plot anticipated variations and compare<br>
them with real-life situations. The new design solution<br>
also had to provide precision tools to account for<br>
To stay at the forefront of technology, BVG<br>
were looking for a comprehensive graphics<br>
software tool the right choice was<br>

irregular curves and straight lines in horizontal and<br>
vertical arrangements. Likewise, a symbol library, as well<br>
as the ability to create and distinguish similar symbols,<br>
would result in increased efficiency, as symbol language<br>
is essential to traffic control systems. Since complex<br>
plans are mostly printed on plotters, support for large<br>
formats and the required plotters was a final criterion.<br>
At the beginning of 1984, BVG&#39;s IT systems consisted<br>
of a simple single platform. Today, it has a multi-server<br>
cluster system, a fully backed-up computer centre and<br>
a 100 MB TokenRing network with 16 MB client<br>
linking. Windows 2000 Server, NT 4 Clients, UNIX<br>
systems and Mac OS are used by almost all of the<br>
3,500 employees working on data technology.<br>
<br>
The Solution:<br>
The choice was Corel DESIGNER 10, a technical<br>
illustration tool specifically designed to meet the needs<br>
of organizations in both the public and private sectors.<br>
Corel DESIGNER allows for precision and scalability<br>
without overwhelming the user. The software is centrally<br>
deployed and used over a network. Employees quickly<br>
became familiar with the basic functions, and to date<br>
BVG has acquired 660 licenses.<br>
Corel DESIGNER 10 offers significant advantages. On a<br>
daily basis, variations in the layout of complex traffic<br>
flows and signalling systems can now be quickly and<br>
easily designed. Gone are the days of photocopies,<br>
glue and colored pencils. In particular, BVG has been<br>
relying on Corel DESIGNER to model the subway system.<br>
The use of technical drawings is by no means limited<br>
to BVG. The Berlin fire and police departments are<br>
making use of these surveys as well. Occasionally,<br>
architectural and engineering firms also require the<br>
technical illustrations.<br>
Overall, Corel DESIGNER 10 has met all BVG&#39;s<br>
expectations. Aside from being comprehensive and<br>
user-friendly, it allows users to create, manage and repurpose<br>
complex technical illustrations, diagrams and<br>
schematics.<br>
On a daily basis,<br>
