        <br>            FutureShield Inc. was founded in Toronto, ON, Canada in 2005, on the premise that there is a strong need for domain expertise in integrating software solutions for security, emergency management, and critical infrastructure protection.  FutureShield combines years of software expertise within a process of: Prepare, Mitigate, Respond, Recover. During the first meeting, we work with our clients to understand where they are within the process and which tools they already have in place. Our  consultation services help solve the problem of where to begin  and it is different for each customer scenario based upon potential threats (accidental and intentional) and assets to protect including people, process and property. Once the solution requirements are set, FutureShield organizes vendor presentations from our portfolio of pre- evaluated and approved suppliers. In some cases, a single solution is all that is required and other cases require fully integrated solutions from leading vendors.<br><br>

BeWare is an innovative decision support system for the control room operator streamlining surveillance by only displaying images and events that have the ability to do harm. It is able, at breathtaking speed, to analyze and combine data from alarm panels and systems, fence detectors, security cameras, public sources and even police files. The system unravels patterns and signals anomalies by making comparisons with historical data. Any anomaly that has a high enough risk index triggers a warning when a threshold is exceeded. Another important feature is that BeWare is self learning and will continuously suggest further improvements to optimize the security measures. The learning process even continues during trainings. It is a dynamic concept that constantly adapts to changes in the environment and takes into account the reactions of security and emergency personnel. Thus, BeWare is always optimally suited to quickly identify new threats and then tries to prevent or at least contain them.<br>

EmerGeo was built by emergency management professionals with over 30 years of hands-on experience in applying GIS mapping technologies for emergency planning and response.  EmerGeo  is a GIS mapping application that sits between existing GIS  system(s) and the WebEOC server or it resides on its own as a standalone application that can be used at the EOC or in the field through the smart client which can synchronize with the central EmerGeo server.  Map overlays (layers) are read directly from such as generating a report on population or critical infrastructure affected within an emergency planning zone around plotted events or even generate hazmat plum/flood forecasts and issue an alert.<br>

Inter-op is a community-wide emergency communication system that effectively provides communication     interoperability amongst local, regional and international Police, Fire and EMS services.  This innovative and affordable technology enables on-demand communication among participating critical organizations and all types of two-way radios, telephone, cellular, intercoms/public address systems and video systems currently being used in your region and throughout North America.  This technology enhances emergency                 communications during routine incidents and in times of extreme crisis with a method that is different than the normal methods (such as landline and wireless telephones) used by the general public, thereby freeing valuable resources and ensuring that the people who need to communicate can communicate during these emergencies.<br>

Organizations today are inundated with regulatory mandates and guidelines: HIPAA, SOX, BASEL II, NERC, COBIT, and FISMA to name just a few. While regulations and policies are enacted to force companies to behave responsibly, the quagmire of requirements, suggestions, and best practices the mandates spell out are leaving many companies buried under a mound of paperwork. MetaFramework uses the entire potential of the risk assessment module to evaluate controls and store evidences. From one single risk assessment, the system can identify the level of compliance with all frameworks on the database.<br>

            FutureShield customers balance efforts ranging from risk assessments, incident management, facility management, emergency response to business continuity. They are also expected to have a good understanding of IT and physical security convergence. Thats a lot of knowledge to be contained in what is often a very small department.<br>
<br>
FutureShield assists our customers by helping them automate processes for security, emergency management, and business continuity. For many, the only tools they have are pen and paper, Word, Excel, or a home grown database. We are proud to work with many organizations that are part of the critical infrastructure sectors to assist them in the transition to technology adoption.We also translate your requirements to your internal IT. As technology AND security/emergency specialists we speak your language as well as that of your IT department.<br>
<br>
FutureShield does not supply cameras, access control, guards, gates, or guns. We do supply software and other technical solutions to assist you in better managing the business processes within your department.<br>
<br>
FutureShield works on behalf of our customers rather than our vendors. This mandate allows us to maintain an open process in evaluating solutions that have the most current and leading edge technology combined with vendor longevity. You will find on our website many products that we have implemented on numerous occasions and consider the gold standard for the industry; however, we work for you the customer and our commitment is to always act in your best interest.<br>

              &quot;We all did great at the Windsor/Essex EOCs, for the most part, and the Detroit EOC was impressed with how we could get info to them ahead of the game...their IT guys have it down pat there and assisted us with laptop and access. The Emergency Management software tools you provided worked excellent, when radios and other online communications failed! Bravo, and thanks for such a great solution, I am very impressed...especially the automatic updates, and link to MASAS.&quot;<br>
- Dan Metcalfe, EW-EMS President OAEM - 2011<br>

Amazing work and support during all phases of initial IT consultation to long-term implementation. I could not have asked for a better level of service and professionalism which is ongoing. Never had a more client-focused and attentive service provision from any company before or since.<br>
- Sgt. C. Zelezney, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator - University of Windsor, Campus Community Police - April 21, 2010<br>

BeWare is an innovative decision support system for the control room operator streamlining surveillance by only displaying images and events that have the ability to do harm. It is able, at breathtaking speed, to analyze and combine data from alarm panels and systems, fence detectors, security cameras, public sources and even police files. The system unravels patterns and signals anomalies by making comparisons with historical data. Any anomaly that has a high enough risk index triggers a warning when a threshold is exceeded. Another important feature is that BeWare is self learning and will continuously suggest further improvements to optimize the security measures. The learning process even continues during trainings. It is a dynamic concept that constantly adapts to changes in the environment and takes into account the reactions of security and emergency personnel. Thus, BeWare is always optimally suited to quickly identify new threats and then tries to prevent or at least contain them.<br>

EmerGeo was built by emergency management professionals with over 30 years of hands-on experience in applying GIS mapping technologies for emergency planning and response.  EmerGeo  is a GIS mapping application that sits between existing GIS  system(s) and the WebEOC server or it resides on its own as a standalone application that can be used at the EOC or in the field through the smart client which can synchronize with the central EmerGeo server.  Map overlays (layers) are read directly from such as generating a report on population or critical infrastructure affected within an emergency planning zone around plotted events or even generate hazmat plum/flood forecasts and issue an alert.<br>

Inter-op is a community-wide emergency communication system that effectively provides communication     interoperability amongst local, regional and international Police, Fire and EMS services.  This innovative and affordable technology enables on-demand communication among participating critical organizations and all types of two-way radios, telephone, cellular, intercoms/public address systems and video systems currently being used in your region and throughout North America.  This technology enhances emergency                 communications during routine incidents and in times of extreme crisis with a method that is different than the normal methods (such as landline and wireless telephones) used by the general public, thereby freeing valuable resources and ensuring that the people who need to communicate can communicate during these emergencies.<br>

Organizations today are inundated with regulatory mandates and guidelines: HIPAA, SOX, BASEL II, NERC, COBIT, and FISMA to name just a few. While regulations and policies are enacted to force companies to behave responsibly, the quagmire of requirements, suggestions, and best practices the mandates spell out are leaving many companies buried under a mound of paperwork. MetaFramework uses the entire potential of the risk assessment module to evaluate controls and store evidences. From one single risk assessment, the system can identify the level of compliance with all frameworks on the database.<br>

            FutureShield customers balance efforts ranging from risk assessments, incident management, facility management, emergency response to business continuity. They are also expected to have a good understanding of IT and physical security convergence. Thats a lot of knowledge to be contained in what is often a very small department.<br>
<br>
FutureShield assists our customers by helping them automate processes for security, emergency management, and business continuity. For many, the only tools they have are pen and paper, Word, Excel, or a home grown database. We are proud to work with many organizations that are part of the critical infrastructure sectors to assist them in the transition to technology adoption.We also translate your requirements to your internal IT. As technology AND security/emergency specialists we speak your language as well as that of your IT department.<br>
<br>
FutureShield does not supply cameras, access control, guards, gates, or guns. We do supply software and other technical solutions to assist you in better managing the business processes within your department.<br>
<br>
FutureShield works on behalf of our customers rather than our vendors. This mandate allows us to maintain an open process in evaluating solutions that have the most current and leading edge technology combined with vendor longevity. You will find on our website many products that we have implemented on numerous occasions and consider the gold standard for the industry; however, we work for you the customer and our commitment is to always act in your best interest.<br>

              &quot;We all did great at the Windsor/Essex EOCs, for the most part, and the Detroit EOC was impressed with how we could get info to them ahead of the game...their IT guys have it down pat there and assisted us with laptop and access. The Emergency Management software tools you provided worked excellent, when radios and other online communications failed! Bravo, and thanks for such a great solution, I am very impressed...especially the automatic updates, and link to MASAS.&quot;<br>
- Dan Metcalfe, EW-EMS President OAEM - 2011<br>

Amazing work and support during all phases of initial IT consultation to long-term implementation. I could not have asked for a better level of service and professionalism which is ongoing. Never had a more client-focused and attentive service provision from any company before or since.<br>
- Sgt. C. Zelezney, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator - University of Windsor, Campus Community Police - April 21, 2010<br>
