Research and Development Directions<br>
<br>
Kumarans Research and Development (R&amp;D) philosophy is based on <br>
three fundamental activities: Incorporating Technological <br>
advances, Knowledge Dissemination, and Development work. <br>
Incorporating technological advances starts with investigating <br>
and assimilating new concepts. This is followed by development <br>
of new techniques and building of a knowledge base. These <br>
concepts and techniques are then put in practice by way of Pilot <br>
Implementations and Prototypes. Dissemination of knowledge <br>
within Kumaran is a major part of our R&amp;D process. This is done <br>
by publication of technical memos, having a central repository <br>
of all concepts and techniques and developing toolkits. The last <br>
critical part of the R&amp;D process is Development Work. The <br>
development work includes Application Tools, New Products and <br>
any components for new Business Models.<br>

Research and Development Directions<br>
<br>
Kumarans Research and Development (R&amp;D) philosophy is based on <br>
three fundamental activities: Incorporating Technological <br>
advances, Knowledge Dissemination, and Development work. <br>
Incorporating technological advances starts with investigating <br>
and assimilating new concepts. This is followed by development <br>
of new techniques and building of a knowledge base. These <br>
concepts and techniques are then put in practice by way of Pilot <br>
Implementations and Prototypes. Dissemination of knowledge <br>
within Kumaran is a major part of our R&amp;D process. This is done <br>
by publication of technical memos, having a central repository <br>
of all concepts and techniques and developing toolkits. The last <br>
critical part of the R&amp;D process is Development Work. The <br>
development work includes Application Tools, New Products and <br>
any components for new Business Models.<br>
