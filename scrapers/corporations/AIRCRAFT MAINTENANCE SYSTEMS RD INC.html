                            Our Inventory Manager software is the perfect tool to manage purchases, invoices, cost statistics, etc. With a single click, the user controlling inventory is able to transfer an item from the inventory shelf to an aircraft work order. With another click, the removed item automatically goes to quarantine if it is a rotable item. If it is a consumable, an entry for scrap is created. From there, a packing slip can automatically be generated to send the item for repair or overhaul, or it can be returned to the inventory with its current time for trouble shooting purpose. Inventory Manager tracks time on components and items to be transferred to and/or from an aircraft. The tracking time will follow. For each part movement, a complete history record is created.<br>
<br>
A tracking number is attributed to each part entering the system. This tracking number will allow the user to enter essential information concerning the part, such as the batch or serial number, the suppliers name, the expiration date, etc. To identify the parts, our system can create a label filled with the required information and a bar code. All part movements are registered in an easy to consult history record. With a simple click, it is very easy to find out where a part was installed, to whom and when it was sold or from which supplier it was purchased.<br>

                            Security and users management are very important in computerized aircraft maintenance, this is why we developed that great utility that prevents non-authorized persons from accessing the program. Account Manager lets the system administrator create personalized accounts for every person who needs to access the programs. You can easily restrict or grant access to each user for different program features by selecting them from a list, thus reducing the risks of mistakes.<br>

                            As you already know, AD&#39;s follow-up is one of the most important tasks in aircraft maintenance. We designed this tool to help you verify and keep track of all AD&#39;s that apply to your aircraft. Using the Internet, this program will fetch new AD&#39;s from the Transport Canada website and display the AD&#39;s for each of your aircraft. You will then be able, with a single mouse click, to read it and see if it applies to that specific aircraft or not.<br>

                            The Air Keeper module was developed from a customer&#39;s request. This person employs a dispatch person to assign the flights to the aircraft of the fleet. This module was designed to alert that person when an aircraft enters a state of &quot;warning&quot; for a maintenance task and that, without having to consult the Aircraft Maintenance Manager program. The &quot;warnings&quot; used in this program are created to reflect the operations and not for maintenance planning as in Aircraft Maintenance Manager. <br>
<br>
Here is an example: If an update of the fleet aircraft time is made at a maximum interval of 10 hours, 3 days or 10 cycles, the software &quot;warnings&quot; must be adjusted with this data. Therefore, when the time remaining before the achievement of a maintenance task reaches these limits, the registration number of that aircraft will appear on the screen with the remaining hours in order to warn the supervisor. <br>
<br>
This tool is essential to guarantee that the execution of tasks will be done within prescribed times.<br>

              For the installation and implementation of our products, most of our customers are requiring us to go on site for installation and personnel training. However, we have some who did it by themselves without any problem.

              &quot;I wanted to send a thank you to all your people.  They have done excellent work for us over these past few months.  You have gone above and beyond our expectations as always.  I honestly do not know how you guys do it.  You make things seem very easy, but I know there is a great deal of effort that goes into our requests.  You have been a great help to my operations, and I appreciate the support very much.  I would like you to know you have excellent people working for you and I enjoy working with them very much.  It would be very easy for you to just say no to our constant requests, but you always go out of your way to help us.  These efforts do not go unnoticed.  If I could get this support from other companies I work with my job would be very easy.  Please pass my thanks along to all your staff.&quot;<br>

&quot;We tried the program with the new updates. They are very good. They added details that make the program even more efficient. Sgt Lebeau and I are very happy with this upgrade. Once again, a very good purchase that continuously self-improves!!!!!&quot;<br>

&quot;We run a 20 aircraft fleet from 4 different main bases, plus up to 4 deployed operations at the same time.  AMS has allowed us to have complete maintenance and logistics information at all these locations just by turning on a laptop.<br>
After two years of using the AMS system we are happy with the system and it allows us to easily manage our aircraft maintenance and logistics.   <br>
<br>
There are a lot of companies out there who are ready to sell you aircraft maintenance management software.  What sets AMS apart from the herd is that they are not the aviation division of some informatics conglomerate.  AMS was developed by a guy who runs his own aircraft maintenance shop, to handle his own aircraft and parts management needs.   Over a period of several years, Richard and his team have developed this software into a complete package which can be tailored to air operators, maintenance shops and corporate users.<br>
<br>
What really sets AMS apart from the competition is their top down philosophy of customer service.  As a somewhat unique operation we have made many requests to AMS for special services.  They have managed to find solutions to pretty much everything we have asked and the strong working relationship we enjoy with AMS today is a credit to their great staff of programmers and trainers. <br>
<br>
I believed that AMS was the best value in the aircraft maintenance management software market when we purchased it 2 years ago.  After working with Richard and his team for over 2 years I am convinced I was right.&quot;<br>

We have been very happy with the system over the past 2 &amp;  1/2  years. Ginette and Marie Josée do a great job in supporting us. (You should give those girls a raise!)<br>

&quot;We chose AMS for our maintenance software after investigating many of the available programs. The advantages to this system set it clearly above the rest. By far, it was the most complete software available and, somewhat ironically, the easiest to use.<br>
The system works well in helping us manage a small fleet of aircraft in multiple locations. The ability to review current information on demand for any aircraft is invaluable.  The software is highly intuitive and easy to use. On a workload basis, the time savings are readily apparent.  Also, I am pleased and impressed with the amount of controls engineered into the software which help capture and prevent data entry errors.<br>
The staff at AMS is incredible and their dedication to supporting their customers is second to none. Any issues which may arise are quickly and effectively resolved through a single telephone call. The training was in-depth, well taught, and highly beneficial.  The most important thing from my experience was to just start using the system as it really is; very self-explanatory.<br>
In closing, I wish to extend a big Thank you to everyone at AMS for offering a product which enhances our safety, oversight, compliance, and budgetary needs. Well done!&quot;<br>

                            Our Inventory Manager software is the perfect tool to manage purchases, invoices, cost statistics, etc. With a single click, the user controlling inventory is able to transfer an item from the inventory shelf to an aircraft work order. With another click, the removed item automatically goes to quarantine if it is a rotable item. If it is a consumable, an entry for scrap is created. From there, a packing slip can automatically be generated to send the item for repair or overhaul, or it can be returned to the inventory with its current time for trouble shooting purpose. Inventory Manager tracks time on components and items to be transferred to and/or from an aircraft. The tracking time will follow. For each part movement, a complete history record is created.<br>
<br>
A tracking number is attributed to each part entering the system. This tracking number will allow the user to enter essential information concerning the part, such as the batch or serial number, the suppliers name, the expiration date, etc. To identify the parts, our system can create a label filled with the required information and a bar code. All part movements are registered in an easy to consult history record. With a simple click, it is very easy to find out where a part was installed, to whom and when it was sold or from which supplier it was purchased.<br>

We designed this tool to help you verify and keep track of all AD&#39;s that apply to your aircraft. Using the Internet, this program will fetch new AD&#39;s from the Transport Canada website and display the AD&#39;s for each of your aircraft. You will then be able, with a single mouse click, to read it and see if it applies to that specific aircraft or not.<br>

                            The Air Keeper module was developed from a customer&#39;s request. This person employs a dispatch person to assign the flights to the aircraft of the fleet. This module was designed to alert that person when an aircraft enters a state of &quot;warning&quot; for a maintenance task and that, without having to consult the Aircraft Maintenance Manager program. The &quot;warnings&quot; used in this program are created to reflect the operations and not for maintenance planning as in Aircraft Maintenance Manager. <br>
<br>
Here is an example: If an update of the fleet aircraft time is made at a maximum interval of 10 hours, 3 days or 10 cycles, the software &quot;warnings&quot; must be adjusted with this data. Therefore, when the time remaining before the achievement of a maintenance task reaches these limits, the registration number of that aircraft will appear on the screen with the remaining hours in order to warn the supervisor. <br>
<br>
This tool is essential to guarantee that the execution of tasks will be done within prescribed times.<br>

              For the installation and implementation of our products, most of our customers are requiring us to go on site for installation and personnel training. However, we have some who did it by themselves without any problem.

              &quot;I wanted to send a thank you to all your people.  They have done excellent work for us over these past few months.  You have gone above and beyond our expectations as always.  I honestly do not know how you guys do it.  You make things seem very easy, but I know there is a great deal of effort that goes into our requests.  You have been a great help to my operations, and I appreciate the support very much.  I would like you to know you have excellent people working for you and I enjoy working with them very much.  It would be very easy for you to just say no to our constant requests, but you always go out of your way to help us.  These efforts do not go unnoticed.  If I could get this support from other companies I work with my job would be very easy.  Please pass my thanks along to all your staff.&quot;<br>

&quot;We run a 20 aircraft fleet from 4 different main bases, plus up to 4 deployed operations at the same time.  AMS has allowed us to have complete maintenance and logistics information at all these locations just by turning on a laptop.<br>
After two years of using the AMS system we are happy with the system and it allows us to easily manage our aircraft maintenance and logistics.   <br>
<br>
There are a lot of companies out there who are ready to sell you aircraft maintenance management software.  What sets AMS apart from the herd is that they are not the aviation division of some informatics conglomerate.  AMS was developed by a guy who runs his own aircraft maintenance shop, to handle his own aircraft and parts management needs.   Over a period of several years, Richard and his team have developed this software into a complete package which can be tailored to air operators, maintenance shops and corporate users.<br>
<br>
What really sets AMS apart from the competition is their top down philosophy of customer service.  As a somewhat unique operation we have made many requests to AMS for special services.  They have managed to find solutions to pretty much everything we have asked and the strong working relationship we enjoy with AMS today is a credit to their great staff of programmers and trainers. <br>
<br>
I believed that AMS was the best value in the aircraft maintenance management software market when we purchased it 2 years ago.  After working with Richard and his team for over 2 years I am convinced I was right.&quot;<br>

&quot;We chose AMS for our maintenance software after investigating many of the available programs. The advantages to this system set it clearly above the rest. By far, it was the most complete software available and, somewhat ironically, the easiest to use.<br>
The system works well in helping us manage a small fleet of aircraft in multiple locations. The ability to review current information on demand for any aircraft is invaluable.  The software is highly intuitive and easy to use. On a workload basis, the time savings are readily apparent.  Also, I am pleased and impressed with the amount of controls engineered into the software which help capture and prevent data entry errors.<br>
The staff at AMS is incredible and their dedication to supporting their customers is second to none. Any issues which may arise are quickly and effectively resolved through a single telephone call. The training was in-depth, well taught, and highly beneficial.  The most important thing from my experience was to just start using the system as it really is; very self-explanatory.<br>
In closing, I wish to extend a big Thank you to everyone at AMS for offering a product which enhances our safety, oversight, compliance, and budgetary needs. Well done!&quot;<br>

Dear Richard, I take a moment to thank you and your team for the collaboration that you make to improve your AMS software. We feel the openness of all your team to work hard to refine your product, making it more efficient and user friendly. Your ability to listen makes you apart from others and makes our daily tasks easier by dint of your attitude and approach. <br>
