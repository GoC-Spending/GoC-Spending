                            Our specialized type of HEAT EXCHANGERS destined for:  <br>
A)  Recovery of Wasted Heat in Sewage Treatment Plants (or other <br>
industries), by preheating of <br>
                                                  Raw sludge <br>
with the outgoing sludges. <br>
B)  Preheating of Raw Sludge with hot liquid before introduction <br>
to the anaerobic digesters.	  <br>
C)  Cooling of Digested Sludge.<br>
 <br>
The cost for this innovative Heat Recovery Equipment could be <br>
recovered within a few years, allowing for substantial<br>
 Savings to the Municipality or Industry, year after year.<br>
  <br>
With the use of DDI equipment,  ENVIRONMENTAL benefits can be <br>
realized together with Reduced Maintenance Costs. <br>
 <br>
     Advantages Of DDI &quot;Cube&quot;, Square Non-Block <br>
       Heat Exchanger and Heat RECOVERY Systems.<br>
 1) Larger Circumference compared to Tube in Shell (round). <br>
      For the same flows area, LARGER Heat Transfer Surface.<br>
      Please see at http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/compts.htm <br>
<br>
 2) Smaller foot print then Tube. Less area required (about 1/3).<br>
      Please see at http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/compts.htm ,  # 3<br>
<br>
 3) More Turbulence flow then in Tube or Spiral.<br>
      I.e. better Heat Transfer due to zigzag channels.<br>
<br>
 4) Non-Block design,  (no spacers or obstacles as in Spiral type<br>
      http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/CompSpiral.htm ).<br>
<br>
 5) Gaps of 3 Inches Minimum, i.e. No Sludge Blockage.<br>
<br>
 6) No need for expensive Macerator &amp; Blades to grind Sludge.<br>
     Savings of about 450,560 $, in 20 years.<br>
      http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/pcompare.htm<br>
<br>
 7) Both sides have doors, with full access to internals.<br>
<br>
 8) Designed for Optimum Height (Non Plug) for each liquid, <br>
<br>
9)	Designed for Optimum Width, best FAST flows speed, to avoid  BAKING.<br>
<br>
10) Quotes with Viscosity =1 CPS as others, and with <br>
       Computerized, assumed, more realistic Viscosities 4-40 CPS.<br>
<br>
 11) VERY LOW MAINTENANCE, once in a few years.<br>
        (Some competition requires back flush every shift).<br>
<br>
 12) Can be used in Municipal, Agriculture or Pulp &amp; Paper.<br>
<br>
 13) Can be manufactured from different metals or alloys.<br>
<br>
 14) Modular system, Can be used for Water-to-Sludge or <br>
       Sludge-to-Sludge Heat Recovery. (Back up units, while not in use, could  <br>
       Be utilized as Sludge to Sludge Heat Recovery)<br>
<br>

The Pembroke Pollution Control Centre is using the DDI Heat Exchanger with very positive results.  Raw sludge with an average temperature between 11* C to 19* C flows through one side of the heat exchanger and re-circulated sludge from the digesters with temperatures ranging in the high thirtys flows through the opposite side of the heat exchanger.  This has resulted in substantial savings as the raw sludge is increased in temperature prior to entering the digesters at no expense to the City sewage system.  After almost two years of operation no plugging has occurred and it works as per specification.  I am very satisfied with the results of this piece of equipment.  <br>

Mr. Schwartz,<br>
<br>
HDR has been very pleased with the performance of the DDI heat exchangers that were installed as part of the City of Tulsa Northside WWTP Sludge Pasteurization System. Three types of DDI heat exchangers (two of each for a total of six) were used in the project:  <br>
<br>
	Sludge-to-sludge heat exchangers to recover heat from the pasteurization effluent and use it to preheat the pasteurization influent.<br>
	Hot water-to-sludge heat exchangers to take the preheated pasteurization influent up to the required pasteurization temperature.<br>
	Cold water-to-sludge heat exchangers to cool the pasteurization effluent after heat recovery down to the proper temperature for the anaerobic digesters<br>
<br>
The heat exchangers are a critical component in an effective pasteurization system, especially in making it economically advantageous by recovering the heat.<br>
 DDIs products have performed well and have not had any problems.<br>
 HDR would specify DDI heat exchangers on other pasteurization projects or in other applications.<br>

              </h4>
           
              DDI has designed and installed Sludge Heat <br>
Exchangers that have been in operations for as <br>
long as 10 (ten) years without the need for any <br>
maintenance.
           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Comparing DDI Cube or Square Heat Recovery to <br>
competition. <br>
<br>
Since DDIs Heat Recovery System has a Minimum <br>
Gap of 2.75&quot; on both sides (to avoid blockage) it <br>
makes no difference which side has Water or <br>
Sludge, or even both sides could have Sludge (for <br>
Heat Recovery).  <br>
<br>
We achieved our NON-PLUG design (compared to the <br>
Spiral design) via large GAPS, NO OBSTACLES and <br>
ROUND CURVES. <br>
<br>
DDI has achieved the possibility of having THE <br>
SAME FLOW in both sides (for Heat Recovery), <br>
compared to Tube and Shell exchangers which <br>
cannot do it (see the SURFACE Heat Transfer area <br>
and FLOW area Comparisons). <br>
<br>
DDIs overall size is SMALLER then the Tube and <br>
Shell and does not require Grinders or Macerators <br>
(adds 200,000$ in 10 years) as the Spiral design <br>
does. <br>
<br>
We have had 12 Engineers working for many years <br>
to come up with this design and to TEST it in <br>
real life with working units.<br>

Contribution:<br>
Our specialized type of HEAT EXCHANGERS destined for:  <br>
A)  Recovery of Wasted Heat in Sewage Treatment Plants (or <br>
other industries), by preheating of <br>
                                                  Raw <br>
sludge with the outgoing sludges. <br>
B)  Preheating of Raw Sludge with hot liquid before <br>
introduction to the anaerobic digesters.	  <br>
C)  Cooling of Digested Sludge.<br>
 <br>
The cost for this innovative Heat Recovery Equipment could <br>
be recovered within a few years, allowing for substantial<br>
 Savings to the Municipality or Industry, year after year.<br>
  <br>
With the use of DDI equipment,  ENVIRONMENTAL benefits can <br>
be realized together with Reduced Maintenance Costs. <br>

       Heat Exchanger and Heat RECOVERY Systems.<br>
 1) Larger Circumference compared to Tube in Shell (round). <br>
      For the same flows area, LARGER Heat Transfer Surface.<br>
      Please see at http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/compts.htm <br>
<br>
 2) Smaller foot print then Tube. Less area required (about 1/3).<br>
      Please see at http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/compts.htm ,  # 3<br>
<br>
 3) More Turbulence flow then in Tube or Spiral.<br>
      I.e. better Heat Transfer due to zigzag channels.<br>
<br>
 4) Non-Block design,  (no spacers or obstacles as in Spiral type<br>
      http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/CompSpiral.htm ).<br>
<br>
 5) Gaps of 3 Inches Minimum, i.e. No Sludge Blockage.<br>
<br>
 6) No need for expensive Macerator &amp; Blades to grind Sludge.<br>
     Savings of about 450,560 $, in 20 years.<br>
      http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/pcompare.htm<br>
<br>
 7) Both sides have doors, with full access to internals.<br>
<br>
 8) Designed for Optimum Height (Non Plug) for each liquid, <br>
<br>
9)	Designed for Optimum Width, best FAST flows speed, to avoid  BAKING.<br>
<br>
10) Quotes with Viscosity =1 CPS as others, and with <br>
       Computerized, assumed, more realistic Viscosities 4-40 CPS.<br>
<br>
 11) VERY LOW MAINTENANCE, once in a few years.<br>
        (Some competition requires back flush every shift).<br>
<br>
 12) Can be used in Municipal, Agriculture or Pulp &amp; Paper.<br>
<br>
 13) Can be manufactured from different metals or alloys.<br>
<br>
 14) Modular system, Can be used for Water-to-Sludge or <br>
       Sludge-to-Sludge Heat Recovery. (Back up units, while not in use, could  <br>
       Be utilized as Sludge to Sludge Heat Recovery)<br>
<br>
 15) THICKNESS of minimum 0.25 which allows for Corrosion <br>
       And  ABRASIONS as well. <br>
       (Tube HX has sometimes just 1/16 or 1/8 thick inner tube from Stainless Steel,<br>
       it is OK against corrosion but NOT ENOUGH allowance against abrasive flow???)<br>
<br>
16)	 HEAT RECOVERY, can have Payback within a year. <br>

The Pembroke Pollution Control Centre is using the DDI Heat Exchanger with very positive results.  Raw sludge with an average temperature between 11* C to 19* C flows through one side of the heat exchanger and re-circulated sludge from the digesters with temperatures ranging in the high thirtys flows through the opposite side of the heat exchanger.  This has resulted in substantial savings as the raw sludge is increased in temperature prior to entering the digesters at no expense to the City sewage system.  After almost two years of operation no plugging has occurred and it works as per specification.  I am very satisfied with the results of this piece of equipment.  <br>

Mr. Schwartz,<br>
<br>
HDR has been very pleased with the performance of the DDI heat exchangers that were installed as part of the City of Tulsa Northside WWTP Sludge Pasteurization System. Three types of DDI heat exchangers (two of each for a total of six) were used in the project:  <br>
<br>
	Sludge-to-sludge heat exchangers to recover heat from the pasteurization effluent and use it to preheat the pasteurization influent.<br>
	Hot water-to-sludge heat exchangers to take the preheated pasteurization influent up to the required pasteurization temperature.<br>
	Cold water-to-sludge heat exchangers to cool the pasteurization effluent after heat recovery down to the proper temperature for the anaerobic digesters<br>
<br>
The heat exchangers are a critical component in an effective pasteurization system, especially in making it economically advantageous by recovering the heat.<br>
 DDIs products have performed well and have not had any problems.<br>
 HDR would specify DDI heat exchangers on other pasteurization projects or in other applications.<br>

      Please see at http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/compts.htm ,  # 3<br>
<br>
 3) More Turbulence flow then in Tube or Spiral.<br>
      I.e. better Heat Transfer due to zigzag channels.<br>
<br>
 4) Non-Block design,  (no spacers or obstacles as in Spiral type<br>
      http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/CompSpiral.htm ).<br>
<br>
 5) Gaps of 3 Inches Minimum, i.e. No Sludge Blockage.<br>
<br>
 6) No need for expensive Macerator &amp; Blades to grind Sludge.<br>
     Savings of about 450,560 $, in 20 years.<br>
      http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/pcompare.htm<br>
<br>
 7) Both sides have doors, with full access to internals.<br>
<br>
 8) Designed for Optimum Height (Non Plug) for each liquid, <br>
<br>
9)	Designed for Optimum Width, best FAST flows speed, to avoid  BAKING.<br>
<br>
10) Quotes with Viscosity =1 CPS as others, and with <br>
       Computerized, assumed, more realistic Viscosities 4-40 CPS.<br>
<br>
 11) VERY LOW MAINTENANCE, once in a few years.<br>
        (Some competition requires back flush every shift).<br>
<br>
 12) Can be used in Municipal, Agriculture or Pulp &amp; Paper.<br>
<br>
 13) Can be manufactured from different metals or alloys.<br>
<br>
 14) Modular system, Can be used for Water-to-Sludge or <br>
       Sludge-to-Sludge Heat Recovery. (Back up units, while not in use, could  <br>
       Be utilized as Sludge to Sludge Heat Recovery)<br>
<br>
 15) THICKNESS of minimum 0.25 which allows for Corrosion <br>
       And  ABRASIONS as well. <br>
       (Tube HX has sometimes just 1/16 or 1/8 thick inner tube from Stainless Steel,<br>
       it is OK against corrosion but NOT ENOUGH allowance against abrasive flow???)<br>
<br>
16)	 HEAT RECOVERY, can have Payback within a year. <br>
      http://www.ddi-heatexchangers.com/energy_savings.htm<br>
<br>
17)	 Tested, in continues Use for 9 years in North America, <br>
               Was NO need to open doors, nor for any maintenance.<br>

              Our specialized type of HEAT EXCHANGERS destined <br>
for:  <br>
A)  Recovery of Wasted Heat in Sewage Treatment <br>
Plants (or other industries), by preheating of <br>
                                                  <br>
Raw sludge with the outgoing sludges. <br>
B)  Preheating of Raw Sludge with hot liquid <br>
before introduction to the anaerobic digesters.	  <br>
C)  Cooling of Digested Sludge.<br>
 <br>
The cost for this innovative Heat Recovery <br>
Equipment could be recovered within a few years, <br>
allowing for substantial<br>
 Savings to the Municipality or Industry, year <br>
after year.<br>
  <br>
With the use of DDI equipment,  ENVIRONMENTAL <br>
benefits can be realized together with Reduced <br>
Maintenance Costs. <br>
<br>
We at DDI-HeatExchangers have designed an <br>
application for you to calculate the <br>
potential energy savings. It is a small (.EXE) <br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              DDI has designed and installed Sludge Heat <br>
Exchangers that have been in operations for as <br>
long as 10 (ten) years without the need for any <br>
maintenance.
           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Comparing DDI Cube or Square Heat Recovery to <br>
competition. <br>
<br>
Since DDIs Heat Recovery System has a Minimum <br>
Gap of 2.75&quot; on both sides (to avoid blockage) it <br>
makes no difference which side has Water or <br>
Sludge, or even both sides could have Sludge (for <br>
Heat Recovery).  <br>
<br>
We achieved our NON-PLUG design (compared to the <br>
Spiral design) via large GAPS, NO OBSTACLES and <br>
ROUND CURVES. <br>
<br>
DDI has achieved the possibility of having THE <br>
SAME FLOW in both sides (for Heat Recovery), <br>
compared to Tube and Shell exchangers which <br>
cannot do it (see the SURFACE Heat Transfer area <br>
and FLOW area Comparisons). <br>
<br>
DDIs overall size is SMALLER then the Tube and <br>
Shell and does not require Grinders or Macerators <br>
(adds 200,000$ in 10 years) as the Spiral design <br>
does. <br>
<br>
We have had 12 Engineers working for many years <br>
to come up with this design and to TEST it in <br>
real life with working units.<br>

Contribution:<br>
Our specialized type of HEAT EXCHANGERS destined for:  <br>
A)  Recovery of Wasted Heat in Sewage Treatment Plants (or <br>
other industries), by preheating of <br>
                                                  Raw <br>
sludge with the outgoing sludges. <br>
B)  Preheating of Raw Sludge with hot liquid before <br>
introduction to the anaerobic digesters.	  <br>
C)  Cooling of Digested Sludge.<br>
 <br>
The cost for this innovative Heat Recovery Equipment could <br>
be recovered within a few years, allowing for substantial<br>
 Savings to the Municipality or Industry, year after year.<br>
  <br>
With the use of DDI equipment,  ENVIRONMENTAL benefits can <br>
be realized together with Reduced Maintenance Costs. <br>
