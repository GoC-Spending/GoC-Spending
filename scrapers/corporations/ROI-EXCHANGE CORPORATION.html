                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              To understand what ROI-Exchange does, it is helpful to understand how the company started and grew.<br>
<br>
Unlike many, we admit mistakes, past and ongoing. Our mistakes rarely have an effect on investor partners, and it is easy to assume that we conceal errors. No matter what investor partners think of their profits or our miscalculations, the anonymity is priceless. As a company, ROI-Exchange does everything right in that it makes investor partners money with unrivaled privacy.  <br>
<br>
Following is a timeline of that growth, from local business advisor to the general partner of international acquisitions that it is today. ROI-Exchange is led by Sean James, Chairman &amp; CEO. <br>
The Chairman may be the essential dealmaker you have never heard of, completing approximately 223 acquisitions.<br>
<br>
1986 -	<br>
Sean James began working at various after school jobs in Toronto; shipping &amp; receiving, construction, automotive glass installation to name a few. While contracting automotive repair and paint businesses to customize his vehicle, Sean realized part-time income could not fund his passion for cars. To get a break on repairs, Sean began bringing in customers to his contacts in the auto repair and paint business. Sean bartered with community newspaper editors to reduce their fleet and staff hourly shop rates for vehicle repairs in exchange for displaying his marketing campaigns and writing articles about his contacts in the auto repair and paint businesses.<br>
 	 <br>
1990 -	<br>
Through word of mouth, a more diversified range of business owners began contacting Sean for help to promote their companies. Sean was now classified as a business operations consultant, with responsibility for more than just promoting, Sean reduced operating expenses, sourced other growth opportunities for the next generation, or prepare sale of company. A dedicated real estate platform was also formed. Sean&#39;s sole proprietor operation would become the ROI-Exchange ancestor James Organization.<br>
 	 <br>
1993 -	<br>
Sean accepted an offer from a U.S. based international business consultant firm. James Organization keeps its doors open, to demonstrate financial stability and their commitment to their customers.<br>
 	 <br>
1995 -	<br>
James&#39; Organization continues to expand its service offerings with selective acquisitions, partnerships and alliances. James Organization was approached by an investor that wanted to diversify from his art business.  James Organization and this private investor launched a new wholesale dealership, solidifying their singular focus on serving automotive importers in underserved and overlooked countries. The automotive importer clients purchased used vehicles, commercial equipment and replacement parts for their regional consumer and commercial demands.<br>
 	 <br>
2001 -	<br>
A South American company joins ROI-Exchange as an importer for our North American petroleum based lubricants manufacturer.  ROI-Exchange plays key role in the importer&#39;s and manufacturer’s growth from 2001 until the manufacturer acquired this importer from ROI-Exchange in 2004. In 2004, we made an error by miscalculating the future enterprise value, and sold for less than the first offer. <br>
 	 <br>
2005 -	<br>
ROI-Exchange expands in the apparel sector by acquiring a North American manufacturer with operations in California and Pennsylvania. We made an error by not aligning ourselves with the talent to fully realize the potential of this opportunity.<br>
 	 <br>
2007 -<br>
ROI-Exchange expands its automotive sector business with the acquisition of a North American based supplier.<br>
 	 <br>
2011 -	<br>
Exchange Select is created to provide stock exchanges with insights on solutions to retain and attract listed companies.<br>
 	 <br>
2014 -	<br>
ROI-Exchange co-invests with Asian conglomerate to acquire U.S. based financial institutions, adding scale, diversification, and superior balance sheet liquidity and return.<br>
 	 <br>
2015 -	<br>
The logo and tagline, which represents the Company&#39;s long-term stability, is updated to reflect our refined direction. As we are relatively unknown, it is assumed ROI-Exchange is perceived as boring, and how as an industrialist will ROI-Exchange ignite their passion for industrialization. Even if you have never heard of ROI-Exchange, it is improbable that you have indirectly benefitted from our work behind the scenes. This is how we will unleash your development.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              To understand what ROI-Exchange does, it is helpful to understand how the company started and grew.<br>
<br>
Unlike many, we admit mistakes, past and ongoing. Our mistakes rarely have an effect on investor partners, and it is easy to assume that we conceal errors. No matter what investor partners think of their profits or our miscalculations, the anonymity is priceless. As a company, ROI-Exchange does everything right in that it makes investor partners money with unrivaled privacy.  <br>
<br>
Following is a timeline of that growth, from local business advisor to the general partner of international acquisitions that it is today. ROI-Exchange is led by Sean James, Chairman &amp; CEO. <br>
The Chairman may be the essential dealmaker you have never heard of, completing approximately 223 acquisitions.<br>
<br>
1986 -	<br>
Sean James began working at various after school jobs in Toronto; shipping &amp; receiving, construction, automotive glass installation to name a few. While contracting automotive repair and paint businesses to customize his vehicle, Sean realized part-time income could not fund his passion for cars. To get a break on repairs, Sean began bringing in customers to his contacts in the auto repair and paint business. Sean bartered with community newspaper editors to reduce their fleet and staff hourly shop rates for vehicle repairs in exchange for displaying his marketing campaigns and writing articles about his contacts in the auto repair and paint businesses.<br>
 	 <br>
1990 -	<br>
Through word of mouth, a more diversified range of business owners began contacting Sean for help to promote their companies. Sean was now classified as a business operations consultant, with responsibility for more than just promoting, Sean reduced operating expenses, sourced other growth opportunities for the next generation, or prepare sale of company. A dedicated real estate platform was also formed. Sean&#39;s sole proprietor operation would become the ROI-Exchange ancestor James Organization.<br>
 	 <br>
1993 -	<br>
Sean accepted an offer from a U.S. based international business consultant firm. James Organization keeps its doors open, to demonstrate financial stability and their commitment to their customers.<br>
 	 <br>
1995 -	<br>
James&#39; Organization continues to expand its service offerings with selective acquisitions, partnerships and alliances. James Organization was approached by an investor that wanted to diversify from his art business.  James Organization and this private investor launched a new wholesale dealership, solidifying their singular focus on serving automotive importers in underserved and overlooked countries. The automotive importer clients purchased used vehicles, commercial equipment and replacement parts for their regional consumer and commercial demands.<br>
 	 <br>
2001 -	<br>
A South American company joins ROI-Exchange as an importer for our North American petroleum based lubricants manufacturer.  ROI-Exchange plays key role in the importer&#39;s and manufacturer’s growth from 2001 until the manufacturer acquired this importer from ROI-Exchange in 2004. In 2004, we made an error by miscalculating the future enterprise value, and sold for less than the first offer. <br>
 	 <br>
2005 -	<br>
ROI-Exchange expands in the apparel sector by acquiring a North American manufacturer with operations in California and Pennsylvania. We made an error by not aligning ourselves with the talent to fully realize the potential of this opportunity.<br>
 	 <br>
2007 -<br>
ROI-Exchange expands its automotive sector business with the acquisition of a North American based supplier.<br>
 	 <br>
2011 -	<br>
Exchange Select is created to provide stock exchanges with insights on solutions to retain and attract listed companies.<br>
 	 <br>
2014 -	<br>
ROI-Exchange co-invests with Asian conglomerate to acquire U.S. based financial institutions, adding scale, diversification, and superior balance sheet liquidity and return.<br>
 	 <br>
2015 -	<br>
The logo and tagline, which represents the Company&#39;s long-term stability, is updated to reflect our refined direction. As we are relatively unknown, it is assumed ROI-Exchange is perceived as boring, and how as an industrialist will ROI-Exchange ignite their passion for industrialization. Even if you have never heard of ROI-Exchange, it is improbable that you have indirectly benefitted from our work behind the scenes. This is how we will unleash your development.
