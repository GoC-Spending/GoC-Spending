Aquinas Institute operated as a charitable organization from 2001 to 2005.  The talents, time and efforts of its personnel were used to raise funds, which, in turn, were donated to local, national and international charities.<br><br>Aquinas Institute received the Papal Blessings of Pope Benedict XVI in 2006 through its spiritual adviser, Msgr. Pedro Lopez-Gallo, P.A. and the Papal Blessings of St. Pope John Paul II in 2000 through Fr. Paul Pang, one of the members of its voluntary advisory board.<br><br>Aquinas Institute is dedicated to the Holy Family - Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  It is committed to carry out its mission in ways that draw inspiration from the examples of the works of St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Pope John Paul II, St. Anthony of Padua, St. Therese of Lisieux, and Blessed Teresa of Calcutta.<br>  <br>In its early establishment, Aquinas Institute had a voluntary advisory board, which included Msgr. Pedro Lopez-Gallo, P.A.<br>(President, Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver); Fr. Nicolas Tumbelaka (Priest, Archdiocese of Vancouver); Lukose Cheruvalel, SDB (Founder, Snehalaya, Guwahati, Assam, India); Fr. John Gibson (Rector, Seminary of the Archdiocese of Bo and Sierra Leone, Africa); Fr. Paul Pang (Director, World Overseas Chinese Apostolate Commission, Rome, Italy); Dean Francisco G. Reyes (Retired Dean, Faculty of Engineering, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines); Ms Filomena Sison (Lay Advisor).<br><br>Aquinas Institute organized and/or sponsored free, highly successful religious events for groups of 300-800 participants from the Catholic community in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland.  These events included Advent Retreats, Lenten Retreats, Holy Hour &amp; Conference for the Youth, and The Seminar on the Holy Eucharist.<br><br>In October 2004, Aquinas Institute released its first publication, a special, beautiful and timeless 250-page book entitled  &quot;Meditations on the Holy Eucharist&quot;, which was granted the Nihil Obstat by Rt. Rev. Msgr. Pedro Lopez-Gallo, P.A. and the Imprimi Potest by Most Rev. Raymond Roussin, S.M., D.D., Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vancouver.  The 2005 Revised Edition of  the &quot;Meditations on the Holy Eucharist&quot; was sold in Canada, the United States and Europe.  This book received &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; as a semi-finalist in the Religion Category at the 2005 Independent Publisher Book Awards held on June 3, 2005 in New York.   There were 2,175 books submitted from 20 countries for this annual competition.<br><br>Aquinas Institute was incorporated under the name of Aquinas Institute Corporation in September 2005 and officially started its business operations as a corporation in January 2006.  Msgr. Pedro Lopez-Gallo remains as the spiritual director of Aquinas Institute.<br><br><br><br><br>

<br>
Aquinas Institute was established with a zero budget in a home based office in Richmond, B.C.  With one regular staff, it has been generating annual gross income of approximately $150,000.00 for the past two years.<br>

It also has a very large database of over 3,500 linguists.  Clients, especially courts, have relied on Aquinas Institute to provide them the most competent interpreters to interpret in trials of high profile media cases heard in the BC Supreme Court or in BC Provincial Courts.  Our ability to provide the most qualified interpreter on short notice is something that our clients appreciate the most.  If you are looking for an interpreter in any rare language, chances are we have the interpreter for your language needs.<br>
<br>
AQUINAS COURT-JUDICIAL-LEGAL INTERPRETER TRAINING<br>
<br>
The Aquinas Court-judicial-Legal Interpreter training has gone a long way since it stated in 2006.  It has become a trademark of the company.  Referrals to the training come from the Society of Translators and Interpreters of British Columbia, the BC Courts and the graduates themselves.  Its new graduates are accepted by the courts to interpret in trial cases upon completion of the training.  Their quality interpreting services have been appreciated by the presiding judges, crown counsels, defense counsels, court staffs, witnesses, clients, the media and the gallery audience.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Excerpt:  &quot;The book is remarkable for the multicultural perspective of its meditations on the Eucharist and for its open grouping of saints, bishops, priests, religious, and lay people as authors including young people and children.  The articles themselves range from the theological (like the dogmatic and inspirational reflections one might hear from the pulpit on the Solemnity of Corpus Christi), to the personal (like the testimonials from the lay core of Eucharistic Devotion).  To emphasize the personal and community immediacy of the Mass and Eucharistic Devotion, the editors wisely include photos of many of the authors, and of parish scenes, as of priests offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and communicants receiving the Eucharist, and other photos of monstrances and Blessed Sacrament tabernacles.  The articles and photos in combination form a portrait of the Catholic Church and of everyday religious observance, with the Eucharist at the centre, which brings me to the authors&#39; purpose in writing this book.  I imagine this purpose to be to inspire a sense of awe and trembling for the Eucharist again, a renewed devotion to the Blessed Sacrament based on spiritual conversion, a turning back to God, and on Eucharistic thinking, as when God is again the centre of human experience.&quot;<br>
&quot;Eucharistic Thinking&quot; written by Paul Matthew St. Pierre in The B.C. Catholic newspaper, Nov. 1, 2004 issue, page 14.<br>
<br>
Excerpt:  &quot;Bearing an appropriate cover design honouring the eucharist, this volume richly illustrated is a fitting tribute to the current Year of the Eucharist promulgated by John Paul II.........<br>
With its wide coverage of contributions from prelates to pastors, pupils, parents, religious and teachers, the volume will have wide appeal and serve to deepen eucharistic understanding and devotion.  Bishop Albert LeGatt of Saskatoon commends the volume as &quot;very fruitful spiritual reading for all those wishing to make the eucharist the centre of their life and prayer.&quot;..........<br>
The section on testimonials opens with a moving account by Rev. Lukose Cheruvalel, SDB, a Salesian missionary, of his eucharistic ministry to street kids at a centre called Snehalaya (Abode of Love), Guwahati City, Assam, India, where his close ministry partners are the Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity.  Cheruvalel considers the eucharist to be the real symbol of the unity of Christ and the church, the &quot;source and summit&quot; of the whole Christian life.  Cheruvalel is aware that &quot;Both in the Eucharistic celebration and in my service to the poor, it is a question of the presence of Christ.......In my service of ..........restoring self-dignity to kids with low self-esteem, giving love to kids who have hardly received or given love, the power of the Eucharist to transform and heal becomes the solid foundation on which hope for the future is built up.&quot;  <br>
In her testimonial, Teresita Nixon attributes her father&#39;s recovery from a massive heart attack to the daily presence of the holy eucharist in his room which &#39;gave him a quick recovery, new energy and a new life.&quot;<br>
With its inspiring content and multitude of local and international scenes, this commemorative volume should win wide public attention.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aquinas Institute honours current Year of the Eucharist&quot; written by Rev. James W. Gray, O.S.B. in the Prairie Messenger newspaper, February 9, 2005, page 11.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Aquinas Institute of Vancouver has produced a very rich work in its publication &quot;Meditations on the Holy Eucharist&quot;.  It includes as foundational text the Holy Father&#39;s Encyclical &quot;Ecclesia De Eucharistia&quot; wherein Pope John Paul II sets out the rich mystery of the Eucharist as source and summit of the Church&#39;s faith and life.  The Eucharist is indeed this mystery of faith that draws us constantly and ever deeper into the mystery of Christ himself in His paschal mystery, into His redemptive Death and Resurrection.  The rich series of essays, sermons and reflections in this publication gathered from a wide variety of contributors helps unfold this mystery of the Eucharist.  Calling us to a faith-filled celebration of the Eucharist and to reverential Eucharistic devotion and adoration, the articles in this book offer a very fruitful spiritual reading for all those wishing to make the Eucharist the center of their life and prayer.&quot;<br>
Bishop Albert LeGatt of Saskatoon<br>
 <br>
&quot;The Meditations on the Holy Eucharist&quot; is a special book published by the Aquinas Institute in the Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada.  It is a beautiful collection of Eucharistic reflections and essays by bishops, theologians, priests, religious nuns, lay people and children.  The Encyclical on the Holy Eucharist by Pope John Paul II and writings by Saint Josemaria Escriva are among the contents of the book.  The articles are not only high inspiring and very informative but they are also well written in various languages.  The book is a true richness of which we must take advantage of and disseminate as widely as possible.  Absolutely recommended reading for devotees and those who are interested in knowing more about the Holy Eucharist - the Centre of our Catholic Faith.&quot;<br>
P. Jose Abel Castillo Castillo, Secretary-General<br>
48th International Eucharistic Congress (Guadalajara)<br>
 <br>
&quot;I have started using the book you prepared on Eucharist for my morning meditation. Now I realize how precious it is.  If you send me some copies by surface/Air mail, I can sell them here. It will probably go like hot cakes. When you send them mark them as gift for Snehalaya.&quot;<br>
Fr. Lukose Cheruvalel, S.D.B., Director of Snehalaya, Guwahati, India<br>
 <br>
&quot;Congratulations, the book is marvelous!  Already I have read two-third of the book and it is spiritually uplifting.  I am impressed with the inclusion of foreign articles with English translations.&quot;<br>
William Kwong of St. Paul&#39;s Parish, Richmond, BC<br>
 <br>
&quot;The book is beautiful!  My book, your book and everyone&#39;s book.&quot;   Irene Munro of St. Joseph Parish, Port Moody, BC<br>

AQUINAS COURT-JUDICIAL-LEGAL INTERPRETER TRAINING<br>
<br>
The Aquinas Court-judicial-Legal Interpreter training has gone a long way since it stated in 2006.  It has become a trademark of the company.  Referrals to the training come from the Society of Translators and Interpreters of British Columbia, the BC Courts and the graduates themselves.  Its new graduates are accepted by the courts to interpret in trial cases upon completion of the training.  Their quality interpreting services have been appreciated by the presiding judges, crown counsels, defense counsels, court staffs, witnesses, clients, the media and the gallery audience.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Excerpt:  &quot;The book is remarkable for the multicultural perspective of its meditations on the Eucharist and for its open grouping of saints, bishops, priests, religious, and lay people as authors including young people and children.  The articles themselves range from the theological (like the dogmatic and inspirational reflections one might hear from the pulpit on the Solemnity of Corpus Christi), to the personal (like the testimonials from the lay core of Eucharistic Devotion).  To emphasize the personal and community immediacy of the Mass and Eucharistic Devotion, the editors wisely include photos of many of the authors, and of parish scenes, as of priests offering the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and communicants receiving the Eucharist, and other photos of monstrances and Blessed Sacrament tabernacles.  The articles and photos in combination form a portrait of the Catholic Church and of everyday religious observance, with the Eucharist at the centre, which brings me to the authors&#39; purpose in writing this book.  I imagine this purpose to be to inspire a sense of awe and trembling for the Eucharist again, a renewed devotion to the Blessed Sacrament based on spiritual conversion, a turning back to God, and on Eucharistic thinking, as when God is again the centre of human experience.&quot;<br>
&quot;Eucharistic Thinking&quot; written by Paul Matthew St. Pierre in The B.C. Catholic newspaper, Nov. 1, 2004 issue, page 14.<br>
<br>
Excerpt:  &quot;Bearing an appropriate cover design honouring the eucharist, this volume richly illustrated is a fitting tribute to the current Year of the Eucharist promulgated by John Paul II.........<br>
With its wide coverage of contributions from prelates to pastors, pupils, parents, religious and teachers, the volume will have wide appeal and serve to deepen eucharistic understanding and devotion.  Bishop Albert LeGatt of Saskatoon commends the volume as &quot;very fruitful spiritual reading for all those wishing to make the eucharist the centre of their life and prayer.&quot;..........<br>
The section on testimonials opens with a moving account by Rev. Lukose Cheruvalel, SDB, a Salesian missionary, of his eucharistic ministry to street kids at a centre called Snehalaya (Abode of Love), Guwahati City, Assam, India, where his close ministry partners are the Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity.  Cheruvalel considers the eucharist to be the real symbol of the unity of Christ and the church, the &quot;source and summit&quot; of the whole Christian life.  Cheruvalel is aware that &quot;Both in the Eucharistic celebration and in my service to the poor, it is a question of the presence of Christ.......In my service of ..........restoring self-dignity to kids with low self-esteem, giving love to kids who have hardly received or given love, the power of the Eucharist to transform and heal becomes the solid foundation on which hope for the future is built up.&quot;  <br>
In her testimonial, Teresita Nixon attributes her father&#39;s recovery from a massive heart attack to the daily presence of the holy eucharist in his room which &#39;gave him a quick recovery, new energy and a new life.&quot;<br>
With its inspiring content and multitude of local and international scenes, this commemorative volume should win wide public attention.&quot;<br>

&quot;The Aquinas Institute of Vancouver has produced a very rich work in its publication &quot;Meditations on the Holy Eucharist&quot;.  It includes as foundational text the Holy Father&#39;s Encyclical &quot;Ecclesia De Eucharistia&quot; wherein Pope John Paul II sets out the rich mystery of the Eucharist as source and summit of the Church&#39;s faith and life.  The Eucharist is indeed this mystery of faith that draws us constantly and ever deeper into the mystery of Christ himself in His paschal mystery, into His redemptive Death and Resurrection.  The rich series of essays, sermons and reflections in this publication gathered from a wide variety of contributors helps unfold this mystery of the Eucharist.  Calling us to a faith-filled celebration of the Eucharist and to reverential Eucharistic devotion and adoration, the articles in this book offer a very fruitful spiritual reading for all those wishing to make the Eucharist the center of their life and prayer.&quot;<br>
Bishop Albert LeGatt of Saskatoon<br>
 <br>
&quot;The Meditations on the Holy Eucharist&quot; is a special book published by the Aquinas Institute in the Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada.  It is a beautiful collection of Eucharistic reflections and essays by bishops, theologians, priests, religious nuns, lay people and children.  The Encyclical on the Holy Eucharist by Pope John Paul II and writings by Saint Josemaria Escriva are among the contents of the book.  The articles are not only high inspiring and very informative but they are also well written in various languages.  The book is a true richness of which we must take advantage of and disseminate as widely as possible.  Absolutely recommended reading for devotees and those who are interested in knowing more about the Holy Eucharist - the Centre of our Catholic Faith.&quot;<br>

48th International Eucharistic Congress (Guadalajara)<br>

&quot;I have started using the book you prepared on Eucharist for my morning meditation. Now I realize how precious it is.  If you send me some copies by surface/Air mail, I can sell them here. It will probably go like hot cakes. When you send them mark them as gift for Snehalaya.&quot;<br>
Fr. Lukose Cheruvalel, S.D.B., Director of Snehalaya, Guwahati, India<br>
 <br>
&quot;Congratulations, the book is marvelous!  Already I have read two-third of the book and it is spiritually uplifting.  I am impressed with the inclusion of foreign articles with English translations.&quot;<br>
William Kwong of St. Paul&#39;s Parish, Richmond, BC<br>
