                            The Digital Human Experience (DHE) is a powerful communication method that combines synchronized digital video, audio, graphics and animation enabling you to consistently communicate a large amount of information in a brief period of time.<br>
<br>
Think of a DHE as film quality video, using your best presenters or professional actors, combined with animation and graphics to deliver instructional training online, product release information, announcements, etc.<br>
<br>
The DHE is reusable and can be delivered and viewed in a variety of methods such as over the internet, through an e-mail, in a Webinar or in a classroom.<br>
<br>
The proven benefits of a DHE are timely, consistent communication of information and significantly increased retention and comprehension of the information being communicated.<br>

                            The Digital Human Experience (DHE) is a powerful communication method that combines synchronized digital video, audio, graphics and animation enabling you to consistently communicate a large amount of information in a brief period of time.<br>
<br>
Think of a DHE as film quality video, using your best presenters or professional actors, combined with animation and graphics to deliver instructional training online, product release information, announcements, etc.<br>
