        <br>            Thomas Keeper consistently performs as one of Canada&#39;s top Realtors. He has been part of the top two real estate offices in the world, Re/max and Century 21. His stellar performance at Re/Max was recognized through inductions into the Re/Max Executive Club in 2004 and Re/Max Platinum Club in 2005. He was also named the &quot;Top Producing Agent for the second half of 2005 according to the Real Estate News and became a member of Who&#39;s Who in Luxury Real Estate that same year.<br><br>Since starting TINK both his sales and exposure have increased dramatically. He is a member of the Board&#39;s Million Dollar Club and is among the top-selling realtors in Canada. He has been featured in such publications as Profiles of Success Magazine and he was also featured on an episode of HGTVs #1 Real Estate show, Buy Me.<br><br>He credits his success to his single-minded focus on giving his clients what they need and a business-like conduct that many respond to even during their first meeting. A thorough understanding of not only the inner workings of the market but also how to devise a marketing strategy to conform to its ever changing trends has also played a key role in his success. But it is his personal approach to clients that really wins them over.<br> <br>What separates Thomas from the rest of the suit-and-tie crowd is his nuanced understanding of the industry his willingness to listen. Whatever your real estate needs, he has established a team of professionals that are the very best in their field. He credits this team, who with their stellar experience, assist him in related areas of each transaction. Thomas is recognized as a leader in the industry not only by his peers but most importantly, by his clients.<br>

              We highly recommend Thomas Keeper. He sold our older home in Mountainview. His knowledge of the area helped us obtain the best possible value for our home. He is a true profesional; whose suggestions and follow-up made this a great experience.<br>

We used Thomas Keeper when we bought a house and sold ours. Thomas was knowledgeable about the market and helped us negotiate the house we wanted to buy down to a fantastic price. Then when we sold our house Thomas worked hard to ensure that the house sold great. We appreciated how he ensured that the pictures on the MLS were professional and looked great unlike many other pictures we have seen. Thomas helped us find the right buyer for our house and worked out the details. We would definitely recommend Thomas to all of our friends.<br>

Thomas helped me with both my sale and purchase, and made it a great experience. If I was moving again, he is the first person I would call.<br>

If you are reading this, youre trying to decide on a realtor to sell your property or to buy one.I was reading these same letters 4 weeks before selling my townhouse for more than I could have imagined. I think it was because I gave full control to Thomas and listened to what he had to say and trusted his judgment as a professional realtor.<br>

 I am writing to tell you about the wonderful experience my wife and I had with Thomas Keeper of ReMax Properties. My wife and I were in Edmonton for a quick trip and were excited enough to hear that our house that was in the market for 4 months was finally sold by Thomas in 4 days.. Thomas was extremely helpful, extremely eager and spent one full week remodelling the items at many places. Thomas did not pressure us in any way and was extremely nice to us and more importantly, to each other. It seems to me that people are always ready to write a letter when they have had a bad experience but not when they have had a good one. I would rather tell you how nice someone was. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. We couldn&#39;t have done any better!<br>

There is no doubt Thomas is the best real estate agent we have dealt with. All aspects relating to the sale of our home were dealt with in a thorough and friendly manner, and we were very impressed with his real estate knowledge. We can honestly say that he worked extremely hard for us, communicating on a daily basis until the house was sold. His willingness to invest his energy and resources was exceptional and we both feel this helped in our getting a fair price in a very short selling period. At the end of it all we have no hesitation in recommending Thomas, for he acted both as a new friend and a real estate professional.<br>

Christina and I would both like to thank you for all your time, effort, and support. You had remarkable patience and fortitude to work with us throughout the entire process of selling our home to a very satisfying conclusion. As first time home sellers your professionalism was amazing and needed and for that you have our gratitude.<br>
Thank you again for all your kind advice and assistance with everything, from completing the condo paperwork to the excellent marketing and advertising approaches. All the best in the New Year and all the years that follow.<br>

It is with great pleasure that I refer Thomas Keeper to you.Thomas recently assisted me in the purchase of a condominium. I have ventured into unfamiliar territory with my decision to own a revenue property and am also unfamiliar with condominium ownership. Thomas has made the process easy and fun.<br>
Thomas is very knowledgeable and was eager to educate me in all areas concerning my decision. He informed me about the current real estate market and gave me specific detailed information on the property I was considering and comparable properties in the area. He took extra time to pass on details regarding condominium ownership and condo board and management company roles and responsibilities. He also provided advice on rental property ownership and landlord and tenant issues. I had a high level of confidence in my decision when it came time to make an offer.<br>
Thomas is enthusiastic, hardworking and resourceful. It is apparent that he takes time to get to know his clients and listens to their needs. I appreciate his forthcoming and straightforward approach. Thomas upholds high standards of professionalism and integrity. I am glad for the opportunity to use the services of Thomas Keeper and look forward to being a client of his in the future.<br>

Thomas Keeper was commissioned by me to sell a home in Regal Park in July 2004.<br>
Thomas convinced me to list at a higher price than I expected. The home sold very quickly, within 4% of the listed price.<br>
I was happy to work with Thomas. I found him to be efficient, ethical, and very pleasant. I would have no hesitation in recommending him to any prospective seller or purchaser.<br>

              We highly recommend Thomas Keeper. He sold our older home in Mountainview. His knowledge of the area helped us obtain the best possible value for our home. He is a true profesional; whose suggestions and follow-up made this a great experience.<br>

We used Thomas Keeper when we bought a house and sold ours. Thomas was knowledgeable about the market and helped us negotiate the house we wanted to buy down to a fantastic price. Then when we sold our house Thomas worked hard to ensure that the house sold great. We appreciated how he ensured that the pictures on the MLS were professional and looked great unlike many other pictures we have seen. Thomas helped us find the right buyer for our house and worked out the details. We would definitely recommend Thomas to all of our friends.<br>

Thomas helped me with both my sale and purchase, and made it a great experience. If I was moving again, he is the first person I would call.<br>

If you are reading this, youre trying to decide on a realtor to sell your property or to buy one.I was reading these same letters 4 weeks before selling my townhouse for more than I could have imagined. I think it was because I gave full control to Thomas and listened to what he had to say and trusted his judgment as a professional realtor.<br>

 I am writing to tell you about the wonderful experience my wife and I had with Thomas Keeper of ReMax Properties. My wife and I were in Edmonton for a quick trip and were excited enough to hear that our house that was in the market for 4 months was finally sold by Thomas in 4 days.. Thomas was extremely helpful, extremely eager and spent one full week remodelling the items at many places. Thomas did not pressure us in any way and was extremely nice to us and more importantly, to each other. It seems to me that people are always ready to write a letter when they have had a bad experience but not when they have had a good one. I would rather tell you how nice someone was. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. We couldn&#39;t have done any better!<br>

There is no doubt Thomas is the best real estate agent we have dealt with. All aspects relating to the sale of our home were dealt with in a thorough and friendly manner, and we were very impressed with his real estate knowledge. We can honestly say that he worked extremely hard for us, communicating on a daily basis until the house was sold. His willingness to invest his energy and resources was exceptional and we both feel this helped in our getting a fair price in a very short selling period. At the end of it all we have no hesitation in recommending Thomas, for he acted both as a new friend and a real estate professional.<br>

Christina and I would both like to thank you for all your time, effort, and support. You had remarkable patience and fortitude to work with us throughout the entire process of selling our home to a very satisfying conclusion. As first time home sellers your professionalism was amazing and needed and for that you have our gratitude.<br>
Thank you again for all your kind advice and assistance with everything, from completing the condo paperwork to the excellent marketing and advertising approaches. All the best in the New Year and all the years that follow.<br>

It is with great pleasure that I refer Thomas Keeper to you.Thomas recently assisted me in the purchase of a condominium. I have ventured into unfamiliar territory with my decision to own a revenue property and am also unfamiliar with condominium ownership. Thomas has made the process easy and fun.<br>
Thomas is very knowledgeable and was eager to educate me in all areas concerning my decision. He informed me about the current real estate market and gave me specific detailed information on the property I was considering and comparable properties in the area. He took extra time to pass on details regarding condominium ownership and condo board and management company roles and responsibilities. He also provided advice on rental property ownership and landlord and tenant issues. I had a high level of confidence in my decision when it came time to make an offer.<br>
Thomas is enthusiastic, hardworking and resourceful. It is apparent that he takes time to get to know his clients and listens to their needs. I appreciate his forthcoming and straightforward approach. Thomas upholds high standards of professionalism and integrity. I am glad for the opportunity to use the services of Thomas Keeper and look forward to being a client of his in the future.<br>

Thomas Keeper was commissioned by me to sell a home in Regal Park in July 2004.<br>
Thomas convinced me to list at a higher price than I expected. The home sold very quickly, within 4% of the listed price.<br>
I was happy to work with Thomas. I found him to be efficient, ethical, and very pleasant. I would have no hesitation in recommending him to any prospective seller or purchaser.<br>
