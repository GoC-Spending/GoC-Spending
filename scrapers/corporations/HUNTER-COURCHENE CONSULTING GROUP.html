                            Hunter-Courchene has built a solid reputation and has extensive experience in the management of all types of projects.  Our experience includes the management of local, regional and national initiatives that have had varying clientele.   We have worked with Aboriginal organizations within the urban centres of Canada and with First Nations within their home communities.  <br>
<br>
The key to all of our managed projects has been an emphasis on expenditure tracking; developing and implementing efficient administrative systems; and, consistent communication, ensuring that the project administrators and their clients understand the project goals and deliverables and that there exists clear communication channels between the two parties. Our goal is to exceed the deliverables and outcomes for each project and to determine the level of success through an evaluation process.<br>
<br>
Hunter-Courchene has established a network of professional associates that have worked with us on a number of evaluation projects.  Our success has been based on our ability to develop evaluation methodologies that can meet the evaluation goals based on the duration and budget of the evaluation.  Our goal is to create an evaluation team that can work with the client and strive to understand the outcomes of any initiative and how it can be continually improved.  <br>
<br>
Our services also include the development of evaluative tools within an initiative that will allow the client to conduct internal and periodic measures of success on their own.  These tools also serve to inform future formal evaluations.<br>
<br>
Our program management and evaluation services include:<br>
<br>
 Project design and development;<br>
 Proposal development;<br>
 Development and implementation of project administrative systems;<br>
 Budget and cashflow development; <br>
 Expenditure tracking;<br>
 Development and implementation of work plans;<br>
 Project/initiative evaluation development;<br>
 Development of research questions and evaluation methodology;<br>

                            Hunter-Courchene has built a solid reputation and has extensive experience in the management of all types of projects.  Our experience includes the management of local, regional and national initiatives that have had varying clientele.   We have worked with Aboriginal organizations within the urban centres of Canada and with First Nations within their home communities.  <br>
<br>
The key to all of our managed projects has been an emphasis on expenditure tracking; developing and implementing efficient administrative systems; and, consistent communication, ensuring that the project administrators and their clients understand the project goals and deliverables and that there exists clear communication channels between the two parties. Our goal is to exceed the deliverables and outcomes for each project and to determine the level of success through an evaluation process.<br>
<br>
Hunter-Courchene has established a network of professional associates that have worked with us on a number of evaluation projects.  Our success has been based on our ability to develop evaluation methodologies that can meet the evaluation goals based on the duration and budget of the evaluation.  Our goal is to create an evaluation team that can work with the client and strive to understand the outcomes of any initiative and how it can be continually improved.  <br>
<br>
Our services also include the development of evaluative tools within an initiative that will allow the client to conduct internal and periodic measures of success on their own.  These tools also serve to inform future formal evaluations.<br>
<br>
Our program management and evaluation services include:<br>
<br>
 Project design and development;<br>
 Proposal development;<br>
 Development and implementation of project administrative systems;<br>
 Budget and cashflow development; <br>
 Expenditure tracking;<br>
 Development and implementation of work plans;<br>
 Project/initiative evaluation development;<br>
 Development of research questions and evaluation methodology;<br>
 Implementation of evaluation methodology in both official languages;<br>
 Detailed and in-depth analysis of evaluation findings;<br>
 Development of final evaluation report with recommendation.<br>
