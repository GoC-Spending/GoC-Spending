                            The Corporate Strategy<br>
Business Strategy <br>
<br>
Our primary business objective is to deliver strong, consistent returns to our investors, while enhancing the long-term growth in value of our real estate portfolio. By following specific operating and renovation-related strategies, we will seek to achieve stability and growth through maximization of cash flow from our properties and investment in commercial and multi-family properties. <br>
Acquisition Strategy<br>
<br>
Building value through property acquisition<br>
RECCMOX seeks opportunities to purchase well-located, moderate income apartment communities which we believe are underperforming, but could benefit from improved property management operations, minor capital improvement plans or major renovation plans. We seek properties that can be upgraded to an institutional quality level via improvements. We acquire properties in selective targeted urban and sub-urban markets that exhibit the proper desired trends in projected supply/demand of apartment.<br>
Building value through Asset Management<br>
RECCMOX asset management assumes overall responsibility for each asset in our portfolio. The goal of the asset management is to develop an annual business plan for each property, including revenue enhancement strategies, line item expense control, capital improvement plans, financing strategies, future disposition/exit strategies, and to insure that the business plan is executed. We believe that much of the opportunity to create value for investors exists in the day-to-day property management and leasing operations. We intend to maximize current and future cash flows by actively managing our asset to create operation efficiencies, lower our cost of capital and enhance cash flows. Well maintained properties will provide attractive and dependable yields over time. <br>
Thus, our strategy is to make continual capital investments in our properties, in order to ensure resident satisfaction, remain competitive, and enhances each propertys living environment.<br>
<br>
Building values through financial strategies <br>
<br>
RECCMOX pays particular attention to the financing strategy for each of our properties to insure that: <br>
- the financing term is compatible with the propertys exit strategy, <br>
- the financing structure compatible with the propertys capital improvement plan, <br>
- the financing takes advantage of locking in low interest rates at the appropriate point of the economic cycle, and <br>
- The amount of leverage is conservatively measured against each propertys operating cash flow prospects. <br>
Analyzing three key factors: interest rates, capitalization rates (Cap rates) and cash cost of equity is vital to understanding of an income generating property. Another factor of great importance is Time. When making acquisition decision RECCMOX measures these factors relative to yield to make accretive investments over a long term even during a period of compress yield.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Building value through disposition strategy <br>
<br>
We intend to hold each of our properties for long-term investment. However, our strategy for determining any particular propertys holding period and exit strategy is based upon the property, capital market, the players and external environment. We intend to review, on a regular basis, the expectations of a particular property during the regular property business plan process. The future expectations for each property will be based upon a thorough review of many factors including: <br>
- projected economic and job growth prospects in the market area, <br>
- projected apartment supply/demand trends, <br>
- the market competitiveness of our property, and <br>
- The future projected return of the property (referred to as a re-buy analysis) compared to alternative investment opportunities. <br>

                            The Corporate Strategy<br>
Business Strategy <br>
<br>
Our primary business objective is to deliver strong, consistent returns to our investors, while enhancing the long-term growth in value of our real estate portfolio. By following specific operating and renovation-related strategies, we will seek to achieve stability and growth through maximization of cash flow from our properties and investment in commercial and multi-family properties. <br>
Acquisition Strategy<br>
<br>
Building value through property acquisition<br>
RECCMOX seeks opportunities to purchase well-located, moderate income apartment communities which we believe are underperforming, but could benefit from improved property management operations, minor capital improvement plans or major renovation plans. We seek properties that can be upgraded to an institutional quality level via improvements. We acquire properties in selective targeted urban and sub-urban markets that exhibit the proper desired trends in projected supply/demand of apartment.<br>
Building value through Asset Management<br>
RECCMOX asset management assumes overall responsibility for each asset in our portfolio. The goal of the asset management is to develop an annual business plan for each property, including revenue enhancement strategies, line item expense control, capital improvement plans, financing strategies, future disposition/exit strategies, and to insure that the business plan is executed. We believe that much of the opportunity to create value for investors exists in the day-to-day property management and leasing operations. We intend to maximize current and future cash flows by actively managing our asset to create operation efficiencies, lower our cost of capital and enhance cash flows. Well maintained properties will provide attractive and dependable yields over time. <br>
Thus, our strategy is to make continual capital investments in our properties, in order to ensure resident satisfaction, remain competitive, and enhances each propertys living environment.<br>
<br>
Building values through financial strategies <br>
<br>
RECCMOX pays particular attention to the financing strategy for each of our properties to insure that: <br>
- the financing term is compatible with the propertys exit strategy, <br>
- the financing structure compatible with the propertys capital improvement plan, <br>
- the financing takes advantage of locking in low interest rates at the appropriate point of the economic cycle, and <br>
- The amount of leverage is conservatively measured against each propertys operating cash flow prospects. <br>
Analyzing three key factors: interest rates, capitalization rates (Cap rates) and cash cost of equity is vital to understanding of an income generating property. Another factor of great importance is Time. When making acquisition decision RECCMOX measures these factors relative to yield to make accretive investments over a long term even during a period of compress yield.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Building value through disposition strategy <br>
<br>
We intend to hold each of our properties for long-term investment. However, our strategy for determining any particular propertys holding period and exit strategy is based upon the property, capital market, the players and external environment. We intend to review, on a regular basis, the expectations of a particular property during the regular property business plan process. The future expectations for each property will be based upon a thorough review of many factors including: <br>
- projected economic and job growth prospects in the market area, <br>

            The Corporate Strategy<br>
Business Strategy <br>
<br>
Our primary business objective is to deliver strong, consistent returns to our investors, while enhancing the long-term growth in value of our real estate portfolio. By following specific operating and renovation-related strategies, we will seek to achieve stability and growth through maximization of cash flow from our properties and investment in commercial and multi-family properties. <br>
Acquisition Strategy<br>
<br>
Building value through property acquisition<br>
RECCMOX seeks opportunities to purchase well-located, moderate income apartment communities which we believe are underperforming, but could benefit from improved property management operations, minor capital improvement plans or major renovation plans. We seek properties that can be upgraded to an institutional quality level via improvements. We acquire properties in selective targeted urban and sub-urban markets that exhibit the proper desired trends in projected supply/demand of apartment.<br>
Building value through Asset Management<br>
RECCMOX asset management assumes overall responsibility for each asset in our portfolio. The goal of the asset management is to develop an annual business plan for each property, including revenue enhancement strategies, line item expense control, capital improvement plans, financing strategies, future disposition/exit strategies, and to insure that the business plan is executed. We believe that much of the opportunity to create value for investors exists in the day-to-day property management and leasing operations. We intend to maximize current and future cash flows by actively managing our asset to create operation efficiencies, lower our cost of capital and enhance cash flows. Well maintained properties will provide attractive and dependable yields over time. <br>
Thus, our strategy is to make continual capital investments in our properties, in order to ensure resident satisfaction, remain competitive, and enhances each propertys living environment.<br>
<br>
Building values through financial strategies <br>
<br>
RECCMOX pays particular attention to the financing strategy for each of our properties to insure that: <br>
- the financing term is compatible with the propertys exit strategy, <br>
- the financing structure compatible with the propertys capital improvement plan, <br>
- the financing takes advantage of locking in low interest rates at the appropriate point of the economic cycle, and <br>
- The amount of leverage is conservatively measured against each propertys operating cash flow prospects. <br>
Analyzing three key factors: interest rates, capitalization rates (Cap rates) and cash cost of equity is vital to understanding of an income generating property. Another factor of great importance is Time. When making acquisition decision RECCMOX measures these factors relative to yield to make accretive investments over a long term even during a period of compress yield.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Building value through disposition strategy <br>
<br>
We intend to hold each of our properties for long-term investment. However, our strategy for determining any particular propertys holding period and exit strategy is based upon the property, capital market, the players and external environment. We intend to review, on a regular basis, the expectations of a particular property during the regular property business plan process. The future expectations for each property will be based upon a thorough review of many factors including: <br>
- projected economic and job growth prospects in the market area, <br>
- projected apartment supply/demand trends, <br>
- the market competitiveness of our property, and <br>
- The future projected return of the property (referred to as a re-buy analysis) compared to alternative investment opportunities. <br>
