                            Years ago, with the advent of the personal computer, suddenly everyone was a graphic designer. Thankfully, that didnt last long. But now, with free web templates only a download away, everyone thinks themselves a webmaster. Not one to reinvent the wheel, we do it the new way but with old school sensibilities, training and experience.<br>
<br>
In an increasingly sophisticated technological environment, establishing and maintaining an effective web presence for your organization is paramount. The Khamis Design team facilitates careful planning, competitor research and thorough client discussions to ensure your web site is truly tailored to the message you want to convey, the data you want to collect, and the image you want to portray to your audience. We design and build for each client to create a unique, functional, interactive identity that will make you stand out from the crowd.<br>
<br>
Thats why our sites arent sights for sore eyes.<br>

                            Photos are more than pictures, theyre an investment in your brand thats well worth taking. And we know well enough that the best pictures arent taken in a snap, theyre prepped and propped and planned to the nth degree. Do you see what we see?<br>
<br>
Done well, this medium has the potential to provide and display a more creative and compelling message that can set you apart from your competition. By incorporating the various elements of audio and video into your promotional campaign, you add the dynamism of interactivity that uniquely engages your current and potential audiences. It is an effective way to educate, entertain, promote and advertise.<br>

                            The pen is mightier than the sword. It may seem cliche now, but it demonstrates the power of words stung together just right. A phrase from over 100 years ago that still stands tall. With the right collection of words, or turn of phrase our writers can have your customers laughing until their stomach aches, crying tears of sadness and sympathy, raging again the machine, or even simply picking up the phone to call you. Every bit as powerful as the graphics that accompany them, our words give meaning and strength to your message.<br>

                            Marketers often give short shrift to those in sales, and salespeople are quick to diss marketers as being superfluous. And many of those on the outside dont even know the difference between the two. At Khamis Design, we cut through the clutter. We believe the shortest distance between marketing and sales is, well, Khamis Design! We do what we do to market your organization or product with one objective and one objective only: to create sales. To make you money. Lots, and lots and lots of money!<br>

                            Years ago, with the advent of the personal computer, suddenly everyone was a graphic designer. Thankfully, that didnt last long. But now, with free web templates only a download away, everyone thinks themselves a webmaster. Not one to reinvent the wheel, we do it the new way but with old school sensibilities, training and experience.<br>
<br>
In an increasingly sophisticated technological environment, establishing and maintaining an effective web presence for your organization is paramount. The Khamis Design team facilitates careful planning, competitor research and thorough client discussions to ensure your web site is truly tailored to the message you want to convey, the data you want to collect, and the image you want to portray to your audience. We design and build for each client to create a unique, functional, interactive identity that will make you stand out from the crowd.<br>
<br>
Thats why our sites arent sights for sore eyes.<br>

                            Photos are more than pictures, theyre an investment in your brand thats well worth taking. And we know well enough that the best pictures arent taken in a snap, theyre prepped and propped and planned to the nth degree. Do you see what we see?<br>
<br>
Done well, this medium has the potential to provide and display a more creative and compelling message that can set you apart from your competition. By incorporating the various elements of audio and video into your promotional campaign, you add the dynamism of interactivity that uniquely engages your current and potential audiences. It is an effective way to educate, entertain, promote and advertise.<br>

                            The pen is mightier than the sword. It may seem cliche now, but it demonstrates the power of words stung together just right. A phrase from over 100 years ago that still stands tall. With the right collection of words, or turn of phrase our writers can have your customers laughing until their stomach aches, crying tears of sadness and sympathy, raging again the machine, or even simply picking up the phone to call you. Every bit as powerful as the graphics that accompany them, our words give meaning and strength to your message.<br>

Writing with a flair every bit as good as our design, our copywriting is worth copyrighting. Read on!<br>

                            Marketers often give short shrift to those in sales, and salespeople are quick to diss marketers as being superfluous. And many of those on the outside dont even know the difference between the two. At Khamis Design, we cut through the clutter. We believe the shortest distance between marketing and sales is, well, Khamis Design! We do what we do to market your organization or product with one objective and one objective only: to create sales. To make you money. Lots, and lots and lots of money!<br>
