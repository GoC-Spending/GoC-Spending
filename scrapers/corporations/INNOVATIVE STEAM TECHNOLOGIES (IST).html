        <br>            Innovative Steam Technologies (IST) engineers and manufactures Once-Through heat recovery Steam Generators (OTSGs) / &#39;boilers&#39; to recover the heat from the gas turbine exhaust stream.  IST also designs and manufactures Fired Once Through Steam Generators for Enhanced Oil Recovery applications.<br><br>ISTs Combined Cycle/ Cogeneration and Gas Turbine Injection Applications<br>In general OTSGs can be used by most electricity power plants and steam generating centers, various industrial complexes (semiconductor fabs, pulp &amp; paper mills, textile manufacturers, glass manufacturers, etc.), mining corporations, large centers <br>requiring stable and flexible electricity (hotels, office buildings, hospitals, universities, sports complexes, factories, etc.), and even organizations that require large amounts of steam such as desalination plants.<br><br>IST is the only proven manufacturer of once through heat recovery steam generators (OTSG) in the world.  IST has numerous advantages over conventional drum-type heat recovery steam generators including the following:<br><br>* Simple operation - steam drums and complex control systems are eliminated making the OTSG capable of remote attended or unmanned operation.<br>* Simple and economical site installation that minimizes site costs and associated project risks.<br>* Capable of dry operation, therefore a bypass stack is not required and the steam system can operate independent of the gas turbine.<br>* More efficient due to elimination of a bypass stack and associated leakage as well as blowdown losses.<br>* Chemical injection to the steam drum is not required, therefore this system is eliminated.<br>* Due to minimal instrumentation and drainability, a building enclosure is not required in severe climates.  This eliminates a costly enclosure from the project.<br>* Lowest installed and life cycle costs.<br><br>Installed &amp; life-cycle benefits of our OTSG boiler make it much more efficient &amp; less expensive than drum-type boilers.<br><br>The above characteristics make the OTSG ideal for the following applications:<br>* Heat recovery in combined cycle and cogeneration plants.<br>* Heat recovery utilizing the waste heat from natural gas pipeline compressor drives.<br>* Heat recovery for steam injection for gas turbine NOx control, power augmentation and cooling purposes.<br>* Heat recovery &amp; steam for pulp and paper mills, textile mills, manufacturing complexes, etc. <br>* Heat recovery for barge and marine based combined cycle plants<br><br>IST currently has 200+ OTSGs spread across six continents. Our technology has been examined and accepted by many customers including global players such as the following:<br>* GE Power Systems, USA <br>* NEL Power, UK<br>* Calpine, USA<br>* Altek Alarko, Turkey<br>* TransAlta Utilities, Canada, USA, New Zealand<br>* GE Nuovo Pignone, Italy <br>* Westcoast Energy, Canada <br>* TransCanada PipeLines, Canada<br>* Solar Turbines, USA, Australia<br>* Alstom (ABB Power Generation), Puerto Rico<br> <br>Our size range currently handles gas turbines from 5 to 75 MW, plus LMS100 for combined cycle and cogeneration applications and the entire gas turbine range for steam injection/cooling applications<br><br>ISTs Fired OTSGs for Enhanced Oil Recovery Applications<br>In addition to ISTs traditional products IST is now designing, manufacturing and installing OTSGs for key oil producing markets such as Alberta, California, Oman, Venezuela and Texas.<br><br>We produce different sizes of units with varying levels of thermal capacity.<br><br>

Once-Through heat recovery Steam Generators (OTSGs) / &#39;boilers&#39; <br>
to recover the heat from electric power plant&#39;s gas turbine <br>
exhaust stream. OTSGs can be used by most electricity power <br>
plants and steam generating centers, various industrial <br>
complexes (semiconductor fabs, pulp &amp; paper mills, textile <br>
manufacturers, glass manufacturers, etc.), mining corporations, <br>
large centers requiring stable and flexible electricity <br>
(hotels, office buildings, hospitals, universities, sports <br>
complexes, factories, etc.), and even organizations that <br>
require large amounts of steam such as desalination plants.<br>
Our boiler size range currently handles gas turbines from 5 to <br>
60 MW for combined cycle and cogeneration applications and the <br>
entire gas turbine range for steam injection/cooling <br>
applications.  <br>

            IST designs and manufactures Once-Through Steam Generators (OTSGs), for the power generation sector and for Enhance Oil Recovery.  <br>
<br>
Power Generation Sector<br>
The OTSGs are simple, continuous flow boilers that convert feedwater into high purity steam.  The OTSGs are best suited technically and economically for combined cycle power <br>
generation, cogeneration and gas turbine power augmentation applications.<br>
<br>
The OTSG has many notable features mainly, full dry running  capabilities, which eliminates the need for a bypass stack and damper.  The OTSG requires significantly fewer parts and the installation is accomplished faster and at a much lower cost than the typical drum-type HRSGs, due to the relatively higher amount of factory assembly and testing that is completed prior to shipment.  The system has a once through flow path; therefore no steam drums or blowdown systems are required. The OTSG demonstrates a significant improvement over the natural circulation drum-type units.  It offers high availability, proven experience, and cost savings benefits.<br>
<br>
Enhanced Oil Recovery<br>
Fired Once Through Steam Generator<br>
- Generate saturated steam with quality 300 MMBtu/hr <br>
- Boiler designed to ASME Section I and American Petroleum Institute (API) specifications <br>
- Piping designed to ASME B31.1 <br>
- Operating pressures up to 2500psi <br>
<br>
Radiant Module<br>
- Cylinder diameter from 30 ft <br>
- Cylinder length about 3x diameter <br>
- Single-circuit or multi-circuit design <br>
- Multi-circuits can be either parallel-pass or circuit-by-sector design <br>
 Internally insulated with ceramic fibre blanket, modules and refractory. Casing is carbon steel. <br>
<br>
Convective Module<br>
- Consists of a serpentine finned tube module <br>
- Tubesheets at the ends are carbon steel with refractory installed on the hot side <br>
- Intermediate tubesheets may be necessary for larger convective sections <br>
- Single circuit or multi-circuit design <br>
- Multi-circuits can be either parallel-pass or circuit-by-sector design <br>
<br>
Fuel<br>
- Natural gas, oils, process and bi-product fuels are suitable <br>

              Gas Turbine Injection (GTI)  <br>
This process consists of injecting steam into the head end of the combustor of gas turbines, reducing unabated NOx emissions; and into the compressor discharge, increasing mass flow and power output.  <br>
<br>
GTI delivers one of the lowest cost per kW* for incremental power, especially when considering the higher capital and installation cost of building a larger plant. <br>
<br>
Gas Turbine Injection has been proven to be a highly reliable method of improving gas turbine performance.<br>

Encana Power,<br>
Cavalier Power Station<br>
<br>
Project Description<br>
The Cavalier Power Station was built in 2001to provide power for the Calgary area. The 228 MW combined cycle plant is optimized to<br>
achieve a schedule of daily start-stops, without requiring additional capital investment or loss of operational efficiency.<br>
<br>
IST was contracted to supply four (4) OTSGs for the Cavalier Power Station. The four (4) OTSGs were built with HP and IP steam circuits, and also included SCR and CO systems for emissions control. The plant also features four (4) x 43 MW LM6000 gas turbines and two (2) x 28 MW steam turbines.<br>
<br>
The customer selected OTSGs because they are ideally suited for cycling applications due to the elimination of drums and other thick walled pressure parts. The thin walled tube design and high-grade tube material permits regular start-stop operation without the thermal stress concerns usually associated with drum-type HRSGs.<br>
OTSGs are capable of extremely fast startups and are typically able to<br>
supply full steam loads within 60 minutes. Since OTSGs start from a dry condition, there is no requirement to slowly heat the water contained within drums. The fast startup of OTSGs allow both gas turbines to reach full load and SCRs to achieve their minimum operating temperature much quicker than traditional drum HRSGs.<br>

The GTAA Combined Cycle Power Plant was constructed in 2005 to provide electrical power, cooling and heating for the Lester B Pearson International Airport. The 112 MW GTAA power plant is optimized to achieve low cost operation and reliable power delivery for Torontos main airport. IST was contracted to supply two (2) OTSGs for the GTAA Combined Cycle plant. The OTSGs were built with HP and LP steam circuits. The plant also features two (2) x 43 MW LM6000 gas turbines and one (1) steam turbine.<br>
<br>
The customer selected OTSGs because they are ideally suited for a<br>
combined cycle application due to their efficient steam production and flexible operation. OTSGs are capable of extremely fast startups and are typically able to supply full steam loads within 60 minutes. Since OTSGs start from a dry condition, there is no requirement to slowly heat the water contained within the drum.

              </h4>
          
              &quot;ISTs Once Through Steam Generator (OTSG) is highly efficient in recovering our gas turbines exhaust heat in the form of super-heated steam. The steam is injected back into the gas turbine in two ways; first, adding mass flow to the combustor which increases MW output without burning additional fuel, and secondly, into the fuel nozzles which greatly reduces NOx emissions and demand on the plants SCR system. Since commissioning in 2002, maintenance on this highly reliable boiler has been minimal, and the fast startup time enables us to get the power plant on line, with full steam injection in less than one hour.&quot;  <br>

&quot;This plant was designed as a base load plant but with the change in our market we had to change to a peaking operation. Our Once Through boilers allow us the flexibility to start up from cold quickly in combined cycle each morning or run dry in simple cycle if it is a short duration peak. We are able to do this without a high maintenance bypass stack or concern of drum temperature stresses and economizer corrosion. The Once Through boilers start from cold quickly, easily and reliably each morning with a minimal amount of steam conditioning required. This allows us to generate an extra<br>
15 to 20 MWH&#39;s each morning compared to a conventional HRSG.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;The Once Through system is helping our plant get a better return for our investment. We are not wasting water and chemicals, which we would be wasting if we had a traditional boiler within this configuration. We are matching steam production to our steam demands, with no need to vent the waste steam up into the atmosphere; there is no waste steam to deal with. The greatest benefit is the flexibility the Once Through boiler brings to the facility because you just produce the steam you require.&quot;<br>

&quot;Materials in the IST units are of a higher grade. My belief is the operations costs will be less, we will have less problems with corrosion and deterioration because the material is better than a conventional HRSG from the get go. When it comes to cost I look at it this way that sweet taste of first cost is long forgotten with the bitter taste of trying to make it work over 20 years. Once Through is going to be cheaper in the long run.&quot;<br>

Manx Electricity Authority,<br>
Pulrose Power Station<br>
<br>
Project Description<br>
The Pulrose Power Station was constructed to provide the Isle of Man with its own source of economical power allowing the Island to be less dependent on diesel engines and cable power supplied from England. In addition to efficiency, the size and visual appearance of the plant was critical due to the location within a populated tourist area and limited space availability to house the generating equipment. Because of the tight schedule for the combined cycle plant, the two (2) OTSGs, gas turbines and steam turbines were installed after the construction of the building. The plant (2x2x1) has a full dry run capability, eliminating the requirement for a bypass stack and diverter valve.<br>
<br>
The steam generation equipment was selected to provide the plant<br>
with safe and reliable operation for 365 days a year, fast startups, small footprint, and a simple cycle dry run capability at the most cost competitive price.<br>
<br>
ISTs two (2) OTSGs were built with HP and LP steam circuits and they also included exhaust ducts which combined with the three (3) diesel engine exhausts streams to form one main plant stack.<br>

                            Innovative Steam Technologies (IST) engineers and manufactures <br>
Once-Through heat recovery Steam Generators (OTSGs) / &#39;boilers&#39; <br>
to recover the heat from electric power plant&#39;s gas turbine <br>
exhaust stream. OTSGs can be used by most electricity power <br>
plants and steam generating centers, various industrial <br>
complexes (semiconductor fabs, pulp &amp; paper mills, textile <br>
manufacturers, glass manufacturers, etc.), mining corporations, <br>
large centers requiring stable and flexible electricity <br>
(hotels, office buildings, hospitals, universities, sports <br>
complexes, factories, etc.), and even organizations that <br>
require large amounts of steam such as desalination plants.<br>
Our boiler size range currently handles gas turbines from 5 to <br>
60 MW for combined cycle and cogeneration applications and the <br>
entire gas turbine range for steam injection/cooling <br>
applications.  <br>

            IST designs and manufactures Once-Through Steam Generators (OTSGs), for the power generation sector and for Enhance Oil Recovery.  <br>
<br>
Power Generation Sector<br>
The OTSGs are simple, continuous flow boilers that convert feedwater into high purity steam.  The OTSGs are best suited technically and economically for combined cycle power <br>
generation, cogeneration and gas turbine power augmentation applications.<br>
<br>
The OTSG has many notable features mainly, full dry running  capabilities, which eliminates the need for a bypass stack and damper.  The OTSG requires significantly fewer parts and the installation is accomplished faster and at a much lower cost than the typical drum-type HRSGs, due to the relatively higher amount of factory assembly and testing that is completed prior to shipment.  The system has a once through flow path; therefore no steam drums or blowdown systems are required. The OTSG demonstrates a significant improvement over the natural circulation drum-type units.  It offers high availability, proven experience, and cost savings benefits.<br>
<br>
Enhanced Oil Recovery<br>
Fired Once Through Steam Generator<br>
- Generate saturated steam with quality 300 MMBtu/hr <br>
- Boiler designed to ASME Section I and American Petroleum Institute (API) specifications <br>
- Piping designed to ASME B31.1 <br>
- Operating pressures up to 2500psi <br>
<br>
Radiant Module<br>
- Cylinder diameter from 30 ft <br>
- Cylinder length about 3x diameter <br>
- Single-circuit or multi-circuit design <br>
- Multi-circuits can be either parallel-pass or circuit-by-sector design <br>
 Internally insulated with ceramic fibre blanket, modules and refractory. Casing is carbon steel. <br>
<br>
Convective Module<br>
- Consists of a serpentine finned tube module <br>
- Tubesheets at the ends are carbon steel with refractory installed on the hot side <br>
- Intermediate tubesheets may be necessary for larger convective sections <br>
- Single circuit or multi-circuit design <br>
- Multi-circuits can be either parallel-pass or circuit-by-sector design <br>
<br>
Fuel<br>
- Natural gas, oils, process and bi-product fuels are suitable <br>

              Gas Turbine Injection (GTI)  <br>
This process consists of injecting steam into the head end of the combustor of gas turbines, reducing unabated NOx emissions; and into the compressor discharge, increasing mass flow and power output.  <br>
<br>
GTI delivers one of the lowest cost per kW* for incremental power, especially when considering the higher capital and installation cost of building a larger plant. <br>
<br>
Gas Turbine Injection has been proven to be a highly reliable method of improving gas turbine performance.<br>

Encana Power,<br>
Cavalier Power Station<br>
<br>
Project Description<br>
The Cavalier Power Station was built in 2001to provide power for the Calgary area. The 228 MW combined cycle plant is optimized to<br>
achieve a schedule of daily start-stops, without requiring additional capital investment or loss of operational efficiency.<br>
<br>
IST was contracted to supply four (4) OTSGs for the Cavalier Power Station. The four (4) OTSGs were built with HP and IP steam circuits, and also included SCR and CO systems for emissions control. The plant also features four (4) x 43 MW LM6000 gas turbines and two (2) x 28 MW steam turbines.<br>
<br>
The customer selected OTSGs because they are ideally suited for cycling applications due to the elimination of drums and other thick walled pressure parts. The thin walled tube design and high-grade tube material permits regular start-stop operation without the thermal stress concerns usually associated with drum-type HRSGs.<br>
OTSGs are capable of extremely fast startups and are typically able to<br>
supply full steam loads within 60 minutes. Since OTSGs start from a dry condition, there is no requirement to slowly heat the water contained within drums. The fast startup of OTSGs allow both gas turbines to reach full load and SCRs to achieve their minimum operating temperature much quicker than traditional drum HRSGs.<br>

Project Description<br>
The GTAA Combined Cycle Power Plant was constructed in 2005 to provide electrical power, cooling and heating for the Lester B Pearson International Airport. The 112 MW GTAA power plant is optimized to achieve low cost operation and reliable power delivery for Torontos main airport. IST was contracted to supply two (2) OTSGs for the GTAA Combined Cycle plant. The OTSGs were built with HP and LP steam circuits. The plant also features two (2) x 43 MW LM6000 gas turbines and one (1) steam turbine.<br>
<br>
The customer selected OTSGs because they are ideally suited for a<br>
combined cycle application due to their efficient steam production and flexible operation. OTSGs are capable of extremely fast startups and are typically able to supply full steam loads within 60 minutes. Since OTSGs start from a dry condition, there is no requirement to slowly heat the water contained within the drum. The fast startup of OTSGs allow both the gas turbines to reach full load much quicker than traditional drum HRSGs.

              </h4>
          
              &quot;ISTs Once Through Steam Generator (OTSG) is highly efficient in recovering our gas turbines exhaust heat in the form of super-heated steam. The steam is injected back into the gas turbine in two ways; first, adding mass flow to the combustor which increases MW output without burning additional fuel, and secondly, into the fuel nozzles which greatly reduces NOx emissions and demand on the plants SCR system. Since commissioning in 2002, maintenance on this highly reliable boiler has been minimal, and the fast startup time enables us to get the power plant on line, with full steam injection in less than one hour.&quot;  <br>

&quot;This plant was designed as a base load plant but with the change in our market we had to change to a peaking operation. Our Once Through boilers allow us the flexibility to start up from cold quickly in combined cycle each morning or run dry in simple cycle if it is a short duration peak. We are able to do this without a high maintenance bypass stack or concern of drum temperature stresses and economizer corrosion. The Once Through boilers start from cold quickly, easily and reliably each morning with a minimal amount of steam conditioning required. This allows us to generate an extra<br>
15 to 20 MWH&#39;s each morning compared to a conventional HRSG.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;The Once Through system is helping our plant get a better return for our investment. We are not wasting water and chemicals, which we would be wasting if we had a traditional boiler within this configuration. We are matching steam production to our steam demands, with no need to vent the waste steam up into the atmosphere; there is no waste steam to deal with. The greatest benefit is the flexibility the Once Through boiler brings to the facility because you just produce the steam you require.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Materials in the IST units are of a higher grade. My belief is the operations costs will be less, we will have less problems with corrosion and deterioration because the material is better than a conventional HRSG from the get go. When it comes to cost I look at it this way that sweet taste of first cost is long forgotten with the bitter taste of trying to make it work over 20 years. Once Through is going to be cheaper in the long run.&quot;<br>

Manx Electricity Authority,<br>
Pulrose Power Station<br>
<br>
Project Description<br>
The Pulrose Power Station was constructed to provide the Isle of Man with its own source of economical power allowing the Island to be less dependent on diesel engines and cable power supplied from England. In addition to efficiency, the size and visual appearance of the plant was critical due to the location within a populated tourist area and limited space availability to house the generating equipment. Because of the tight schedule for the combined cycle plant, the two (2) OTSGs, gas turbines and steam turbines were installed after the construction of the building. The plant (2x2x1) has a full dry run capability, eliminating the requirement for a bypass stack and diverter valve.<br>
<br>
The steam generation equipment was selected to provide the plant<br>
with safe and reliable operation for 365 days a year, fast startups, small footprint, and a simple cycle dry run capability at the most cost competitive price.<br>
<br>
ISTs two (2) OTSGs were built with HP and LP steam circuits and they also included exhaust ducts which combined with the three (3) diesel engine exhausts streams to form one main plant stack.<br>
