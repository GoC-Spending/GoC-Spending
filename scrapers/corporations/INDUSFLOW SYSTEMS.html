                            SYNDi is a software package that manages mortgages and other loans in cases where a group of investors lends money for a loan. It is used primarily by companies providing financial services. In a typical scenario, the company sets up the syndicate, advances the loan amount to the borrower, receives the payment on monthly basis and distributes it to the investors after deducting a percentage from the interest amount as the management fee. The system automates the loan management cycle and maintains relevant records until the loan is paid off.<br>
<br>
SYNDi is a general purpose application that handles all loans <br>
including mortgages that are payable in monthly installments <br>
(interest only or amortized over a period with a balloon <br>
payment).<br>

                            SYNDi Investment Ledger manages stocks, bonds, notes and other financial instruments in an investment portfolio. It helps in situations where you attempt to maintain the investment history in General Ledger. Typically a G/L account is set up for each security and is often extended to the partner level through sub-accounts for tracking purpose. The result is that the chart of accounts soars to an unmanageable level. SYNDi Investment Ledger solves the problem by maintaining individual transactions while passing a simple journal entry to General Ledger. With SYNDi Investment Ledger you may set up just one or two asset accounts for investments and maintain all history within the sub-ledger, thus keeping your General Ledger clean and streamlined.<br>

                            SYNDi is a software package that manages mortgages and other loans in cases where a group of investors lends money for a loan. It is used primarily by companies providing financial services. In a typical scenario, the company sets up the syndicate, advances the loan amount to the borrower, receives the payment on monthly basis and distributes it to the investors after deducting a percentage from the interest amount as the management fee. The system automates the loan management cycle and maintains relevant records until the loan is paid off.<br>
<br>
SYNDi is a general purpose application that handles all loans <br>
including mortgages that are payable in monthly installments <br>
(interest only or amortized over a period with a balloon <br>
payment).<br>

                            SYNDi Investment Ledger manages stocks, bonds, notes and other financial instruments in an investment portfolio. It helps in situations where you attempt to maintain the investment history in General Ledger. Typically a G/L account is set up for each security and is often extended to the partner level through sub-accounts for tracking purpose. The result is that the chart of accounts soars to an unmanageable level. SYNDi Investment Ledger solves the problem by maintaining individual transactions while passing a simple journal entry to General Ledger. With SYNDi Investment Ledger you may set up just one or two asset accounts for investments and maintain all history within the sub-ledger, thus keeping your General Ledger clean and streamlined.<br>
