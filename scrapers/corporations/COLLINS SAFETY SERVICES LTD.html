                            Industry leading training that saves time and money while training at your own pace. Online Training is your answer to effective alternative learning solutions in safety !  <br>
<br>
Everyone is turning to the web these day&#39;s. Let&#39;s face it...we live in a world that demands speed and efficiency. This puts an ever increasing demand on organizations to find alternative ways to keep up. Interest in online or e-learning training is growing more than ever now to meet the needs of most organizations to not only save time and money but to help keep the focus on their business while learning. <br>
<br>
What is e-learning?<br>
<br>
Most simply put, e-learning is the application of computer technologies to education whether used face-to-face in school or workplace settings, blended with traditional learning, to deliver a course fully online, or for self-directed informal learning. <br>
<br>
How does e-learning help Canadians learn?<br>
<br>
E-learning provides Canadians the flexibility to learn at their own pace at any stage in the life span thereby fostering positive attitudes about the value of lifelong learning.<br>
<br>
<br>
» Self-directed: Learners can choose content and tools appropriate to their differing interests, needs, and skill levels.<br>
» Reduces physical and geographical barriers: More educational options to learners with<br>
disabilities, and those living in remote areas.<br>
» Timely: Learning can be delivered and learned when desired or necessary.<br>
<br>
To have available all the necessary safety learning information at your finger tips is not only convenient but cost efficient and effective as well. Online training is worth investigating for companies of all sizes<br>
<br>
Our online training courses are designed to be effective and comprehensive, maximizing engagement, comprehension and retention in a dynamic, interactive style.<br>

              Testimonial - Pristine Labour Inc. <br>
<br>
We recently had Collins Safety Services design and create a Safety Orientation Program for our company...Pristine Labour Inc.  <br>
<br>
We were exceptionally happy with the end result. The product created was outstanding and way beyond our expectations. <br>
<br>
They designed and developed the program into an easy to use e-learning component with a quiz at the end to help us understand how well the person taking the training would receive the information. Our employees find it very simple to do and easy to learn from.<br>
<br>
Our clients are very impressed with this professional program. The program has really helped make us into a cutting edge company now and a leader in the field of Temporary Labour. None of our competitors have anything like this.<br>
<br>
We want to sincerely thank Joe and Collins Safety Services Ltd. for going above and beyond. <br>
The product they created was simply amazing! <br>
<br>
Many thanks Joe.<br>

                            Industry leading training that saves time and money while training at your own pace. Online Training is your answer to effective alternative learning solutions in safety !  <br>
<br>
Everyone is turning to the web these day&#39;s. Let&#39;s face it...we live in a world that demands speed and efficiency. This puts an ever increasing demand on organizations to find alternative ways to keep up. Interest in online or e-learning training is growing more than ever now to meet the needs of most organizations to not only save time and money but to help keep the focus on their business while learning. <br>
<br>
What is e-learning?<br>
<br>
Most simply put, e-learning is the application of computer technologies to education whether used face-to-face in school or workplace settings, blended with traditional learning, to deliver a course fully online, or for self-directed informal learning. <br>
<br>
How does e-learning help Canadians learn?<br>
<br>
E-learning provides Canadians the flexibility to learn at their own pace at any stage in the life span thereby fostering positive attitudes about the value of lifelong learning.<br>
<br>
<br>
» Self-directed: Learners can choose content and tools appropriate to their differing interests, needs, and skill levels.<br>
» Reduces physical and geographical barriers: More educational options to learners with<br>
disabilities, and those living in remote areas.<br>
» Timely: Learning can be delivered and learned when desired or necessary.<br>
<br>
To have available all the necessary safety learning information at your finger tips is not only convenient but cost efficient and effective as well. Online training is worth investigating for companies of all sizes<br>
<br>
Our online training courses are designed to be effective and comprehensive, maximizing engagement, comprehension and retention in a dynamic, interactive style.<br>

              Testimonial - Pristine Labour Inc. <br>
<br>
We recently had Collins Safety Services design and create a Safety Orientation Program for our company...Pristine Labour Inc.  <br>
<br>
We were exceptionally happy with the end result. The product created was outstanding and way beyond our expectations. <br>
<br>
They designed and developed the program into an easy to use e-learning component with a quiz at the end to help us understand how well the person taking the training would receive the information. Our employees find it very simple to do and easy to learn from.<br>
<br>
Our clients are very impressed with this professional program. The program has really helped make us into a cutting edge company now and a leader in the field of Temporary Labour. None of our competitors have anything like this.<br>
<br>
We want to sincerely thank Joe and Collins Safety Services Ltd. for going above and beyond. <br>
The product they created was simply amazing! <br>
<br>
Many thanks Joe.<br>
