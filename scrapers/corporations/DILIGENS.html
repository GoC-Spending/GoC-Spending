                            Diligens Inc. is unique in its ability to provide customers a<br>
complete offering of power management products and custom<br>
solutions. While we are well established as ?Information<br>
technology? network and software solutions provider, our name is<br>
new to many in the power management and service provider<br>
community. And yet it is here where the benefits of our expertise<br>
in software solutions, system integration and manufacturing pay<br>
their biggest dividends.<br>
<br>
We offer a complete line of power management solutions for power<br>
applications including, transient surge suppression (TVSS),<br>
harmonic mitigation transformers, medical grade power<br>
conditioners, UL 924 emergency lighting systems, power<br>
distribution units, diesel generators, uninterruptible power<br>
supplies (UPS) commercial, and industrial grade. Our Power<br>
Management Group has over 20 years experience in quality power<br>
management solutions.<br>
<br>
At the core of our philosophy is a willingness to invest the<br>
necessary resources to develop a custom solution that meets your<br>
specific requirements. We will source the best solution for your<br>
application and negotiate the best price on your behalf. Our team<br>
is ready to address a wide range of AC or DC power problems: be<br>
it, transient suppression (lightning protection), electrical line<br>
noise, brownout conditions, harmonic filtering, redundant power<br>
configurations, power distribution, and remote power management<br>
or network power management. No application is too difficult for<br>
us to handle.<br>
<br>

                            If you require periodic or full time IT services, Diligens will<br>
tailor a managed service solution for you. Our clients may choose<br>
from a menu of services, including server operations. Through the<br>
use of secure VPN channels, Diligens can resolve issues remotely<br>
or on your site if necessary. Our easy to read Service Level<br>
Agreement (SLA) ensures that you receive the priority and<br>
response time to your call. Other managed services for client<br>
locations in the Ottawa region can include desktop support, LAN<br>
and networking support, and network monitoring. We do all this<br>
for one, predictable monthly fee that?s far less than most<br>
companies currently pay to manage their own IT environment.<br>
<br>
Operational coverage by Diligens for all aspects of the IT<br>
infrastructure<br>
<br>
Our clients may offload as much or as little of their IT workload<br>
as they wish. Our remote Application Management Center provides<br>
the tools and expertise to monitor and manage your infrastructure<br>
from end to end. Our services include:<br>
<br>
    * Server Operations: Cross platform support including Unix,<br>
Linux, Windows NT/2000/.NET daily operations.<br>
<br>
    * Tape Backups: Incremental daily backups and weekly on-site<br>
tape backup and rotation (offsite storage is also available) is<br>
essential to operate your business safely. It is estimated that<br>
30% of companies go bankrupt within one year of suffering a major<br>
fire or theft due to business data being destroyed or lost!<br>
<br>
    * Internet Help Desk: The Internet Help Desk provides a<br>
single point of contact for all user queries or problems that are<br>
managed through to resolution by Diligens? own staff, or by third<br>
party suppliers. Requests can be logged by using a Web based<br>
application and our support staff will then contact users within<br>
the timeframes defined in the Service Level Agreement (SLA).<br>

    * Service Level Agreement (SLA): Once we have agreed upon<br>
your service requirements, we present a clearly defined and<br>
measurable service level agreement. Regular reports and meetings<br>
make it easy for you to monitor performance levels and identify<br>
opportunities for service enhancement.<br>
<br>
    * Software Deployment: Automated distribution of software<br>
applications, upgrades and fixes means that applications can be<br>
rolled out to users in hours instead of weeks.<br>
<br>
    * Standard Applications Support: We provide end user support<br>
for standard applications like Microsoft Exchange, Virus<br>
protection programs and so on.<br>
<br>
    * Applications: The architecture, configuration, integration<br>
and deployment of an enterprise solution (e.g. Oracle<br>
application), or the design and development of a custom solution<br>
tailored to your needs (please consult our software development<br>
section for details). Either solution would also incorporate<br>
testing, training and project management of the implementation.<br>
Implementation costing is done on a per project basis in<br>
accordance with the project scope.<br>
<br>
    * Reporting: Statistical, trend or real-time reports will be<br>
provided for:<br>
          * Availability and downtime of devices.<br>
          * Service performance.<br>

                            Diligens Inc. is unique in its ability to provide customers a<br>
complete offering of power management products and custom<br>
solutions. While we are well established as ?Information<br>
technology? network and software solutions provider, our name is<br>
new to many in the power management and service provider<br>
community. And yet it is here where the benefits of our expertise<br>
in software solutions, system integration and manufacturing pay<br>
their biggest dividends.<br>
<br>
We offer a complete line of power management solutions for power<br>
applications including, transient surge suppression (TVSS),<br>
harmonic mitigation transformers, medical grade power<br>
conditioners, UL 924 emergency lighting systems, power<br>
distribution units, diesel generators, uninterruptible power<br>
supplies (UPS) commercial, and industrial grade. Our Power<br>
Management Group has over 20 years experience in quality power<br>
management solutions.<br>
<br>
At the core of our philosophy is a willingness to invest the<br>
necessary resources to develop a custom solution that meets your<br>
specific requirements. We will source the best solution for your<br>
application and negotiate the best price on your behalf. Our team<br>
is ready to address a wide range of AC or DC power problems: be<br>
it, transient suppression (lightning protection), electrical line<br>
noise, brownout conditions, harmonic filtering, redundant power<br>
configurations, power distribution, and remote power management<br>
or network power management. No application is too difficult for<br>
us to handle.<br>
<br>

                            If you require periodic or full time IT services, Diligens will<br>
tailor a managed service solution for you. Our clients may choose<br>
from a menu of services, including server operations. Through the<br>
use of secure VPN channels, Diligens can resolve issues remotely<br>
or on your site if necessary. Our easy to read Service Level<br>
Agreement (SLA) ensures that you receive the priority and<br>
response time to your call. Other managed services for client<br>
locations in the Ottawa region can include desktop support, LAN<br>
and networking support, and network monitoring. We do all this<br>
for one, predictable monthly fee that?s far less than most<br>
companies currently pay to manage their own IT environment.<br>
<br>
Operational coverage by Diligens for all aspects of the IT<br>
infrastructure<br>
<br>
Our clients may offload as much or as little of their IT workload<br>
as they wish. Our remote Application Management Center provides<br>
the tools and expertise to monitor and manage your infrastructure<br>
from end to end. Our services include:<br>
<br>
    * Server Operations: Cross platform support including Unix,<br>
Linux, Windows NT/2000/.NET daily operations.<br>
<br>
    * Tape Backups: Incremental daily backups and weekly on-site<br>
tape backup and rotation (offsite storage is also available) is<br>
essential to operate your business safely. It is estimated that<br>
30% of companies go bankrupt within one year of suffering a major<br>
fire or theft due to business data being destroyed or lost!<br>
<br>
    * Internet Help Desk: The Internet Help Desk provides a<br>
single point of contact for all user queries or problems that are<br>
managed through to resolution by Diligens? own staff, or by third<br>
party suppliers. Requests can be logged by using a Web based<br>
application and our support staff will then contact users within<br>
the timeframes defined in the Service Level Agreement (SLA).<br>

your service requirements, we present a clearly defined and<br>
measurable service level agreement. Regular reports and meetings<br>
make it easy for you to monitor performance levels and identify<br>
opportunities for service enhancement.<br>
<br>
    * Software Deployment: Automated distribution of software<br>
applications, upgrades and fixes means that applications can be<br>
rolled out to users in hours instead of weeks.<br>
<br>
    * Standard Applications Support: We provide end user support<br>
for standard applications like Microsoft Exchange, Virus<br>
protection programs and so on.<br>
<br>
    * Applications: The architecture, configuration, integration<br>
and deployment of an enterprise solution (e.g. Oracle<br>
application), or the design and development of a custom solution<br>
tailored to your needs (please consult our software development<br>
section for details). Either solution would also incorporate<br>
testing, training and project management of the implementation.<br>
Implementation costing is done on a per project basis in<br>
accordance with the project scope.<br>
<br>
    * Reporting: Statistical, trend or real-time reports will be<br>
provided for:<br>
          * Availability and downtime of devices.<br>
          * Service performance.<br>
