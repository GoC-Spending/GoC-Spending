“In working with Elaine in the past, her efficient and timely follow up and communication with me, has consistently delivered quality candidates for our consideration at each level of management we have requested.

<br>
<br>
“I have known Elaine Hay for approximately six years now and used Campbell Edgar Inc. for recruitment purposes.<br>
<br>
I highly recommend the services of Campbell Edgar and in particular the President, Elaine Hay.  It can be said of most woman that they have an intuitive ability; however, Elaine elevates this ability into a fine art.  She has the skill of a surgeon in dissecting the vibe and pulse of an organisation, understanding the operation, requirements and needs thereof and then transferring this culture into a needs assessment in the recruitment process.  <br>
<br>
Elaine’s clearly superior intuition is what distinguishes her as a true professional in her field, the ability to source the right person for the position on all levels of staffing.  Business is like any other human relationship, the correct match of personalities is crucial to ensure success.  If you are looking at furthering your organisation, look no further than Elaine Hay for all your staffing requirements.  <br>
<br>
I singled out Intuition for a purpose, this is what I believe separates Elaine from the rest, everyone worth doing business with strives for professionalism, ethical integrity, excellent service, value for money and the list is almost endless, but if you want this and more, then look for someone that will show the level of intuition required to find the match your organisation so rightly deserves, someone concerned with empowering your organisation to fulfill their mission, with the very best of career matched people.”<br>

&quot;Elaine initially helped me fill a knowledge worker position in my company. She made an excellent choice and delivered really good value. <br>
<br>
More recently, Elaine helped us hire a new President for a very visible organization. She succeeded in sourcing, recommending and presenting astonishingly good candidates, helped us through a complex hiring process, and did it all within very tight deadlines. When you need Executive Search, you need Elaine.&quot; <br>

“Elaine was a joy to work with at Junior Achievement. She was a loyal, reliable, volunteer and a valuable mentor to the young people who she provided with business programming in schools throughout Vancouver. <br>
As Governor for the Better Business Bureau, she continues to give back to the community. Recently, Elaine worked with me in redefining my career objectives and provided me with many &#39;aha&#39; moments for which I am most appreciative. She is able to discover the passion in people and match them to the work that will feed their soul. I highly recommend Elaine if you are seeking a career change, or looking for the perfect person to work in your business.”<br>

“As an Executive Board member of a not for profit company, I had the privilege to work with Elaine (Campbell, Edgar) who was hired to assist in identifying a new President/CEO.<br>

“I found the manner in which Campbell, Edgar conducted themselves, as well as their screening practices, to be of the utmost highest standards of professionalism! Elaine Hay and Laurel Krause were very respectful, helpful, professional and diligent throughout the whole process and a fine testament to a fine company such as Campbell Edgar Inc. I would recommend them to anyone that is looking to make a career change or seeking that missing piece of their work force puzzle. I plan on using Campbell Edgar in my new position to help me find the right people and have already recently done so.<br>
 It just goes to show, that even in the darkest of industries one can find a diamond.” <br>

“I have worked with Elaine on 2 separate instances providing recruitment services.  The first was to provide a temporary maternity leave replacement at my business.  <br>
Most recently she provided Executive Services to seek the replacement of a retiring President for a high profile British Columbia Not-For-Profit Organization.  In both cases, I found her to be very professional and aware of the specific (and differing) needs of our business and the Society.  She is diligent and thorough in her approach and excels in identifying quality candidates making the selection process much easier.  I highly recommend her Administrative and Executive searches.”	<br>

After knowing Elaine for about 20 years, it is evident that she puts incredible effort into knowing her clients, but also the potential recruits. She is diligent in her research, and takes the utmost care and attention when matching both the client and the recruit. She has placed me in 2 positions that have spanned the majority of my 35 year career, thus a true testament that Elaine has superior talent and skill as a recruiter.&quot;<br>

“You understood our corporate needs and culture and provided candidates that<br>
were appropriate not only in skill but in personality for our company. You also<br>
managed the entire process from start to finish and eliminated our administrative<br>
input. We were also very pleased to have a more personal history of the<br>
candidates beyond the traditional resume which highlighted their personalities<br>
rather than simply focusing on their skills and experience. We are firm believers<br>
that finding the right fit for both the company and employees is what will make<br>
our company stronger. You have delivered on that promise.”<br>

We have had great success with our partnership with both the permanent and temporary services provided! Campbell Edgar feels like an extension of our family! They look after us very professionally and work with us on finding a fit not just a body!”<br>
<br>
Working with Elaine for over 10 years as a candidate and client has been a very<br>
rewarding experience. I have found that she treats both sides of her business<br>
(candidate and client relationships) very professionally and is always willing to<br>
help in resolving recruitment issues with the highest of integrity and standards.<br>
Her expertise in friendly customer service, business savvy and retail experience<br>
is shared with her team. All of her employees have the same strong ethics as<br>
Elaine and this makes for an amazing&quot; and seamless experience when working<br>
with her organization.<br>
<br>
I know Elaine is very active in her community outside of her regular duties as the<br>
Founder of Campbell Edgar and brings her passion and experience to the table<br>
every time.<br>

We are very lucky to have a strong, ethical and committed organization like<br>

“I have a small chain of 11 hair salons in BC interior. As an absentee owner, I rely upon someone else to run the business on a day to day basis. In 2007 it became apparent that a change in management was overdue but, given that I live in Atlanta – nearly 3000 miles from my stores – I didn’t know how to find the kind of person I knew I needed. Experience in hair was not a pre-requisite. I was more interested in someone with proven retail management skills across multiple locations.<br>
<br>
I can’t remember how I came across Campbell Edgar, but I’m certainly glad that I did. Not only did they provide a list of well qualified candidates and set up convenient interviews, but Elaine “helped” me towards my eventual choice.<br>
<br>
Ross has worked out better than I dared hope. He’s brought structure and consistency to the company, while improving morale at every level. I highly commend your service and hope I never need to use you to find his replacement!” <br>

<br>
“I have known Elaine Hay for approximately six years now and used Campbell Edgar Inc. for recruitment purposes.<br>
<br>
I highly recommend the services of Campbell Edgar and in particular the President, Elaine Hay.  It can be said of most woman that they have an intuitive ability; however, Elaine elevates this ability into a fine art.  She has the skill of a surgeon in dissecting the vibe and pulse of an organisation, understanding the operation, requirements and needs thereof and then transferring this culture into a needs assessment in the recruitment process.  <br>
<br>
Elaine’s clearly superior intuition is what distinguishes her as a true professional in her field, the ability to source the right person for the position on all levels of staffing.  Business is like any other human relationship, the correct match of personalities is crucial to ensure success.  If you are looking at furthering your organisation, look no further than Elaine Hay for all your staffing requirements.  <br>
<br>
I singled out Intuition for a purpose, this is what I believe separates Elaine from the rest, everyone worth doing business with strives for professionalism, ethical integrity, excellent service, value for money and the list is almost endless, but if you want this and more, then look for someone that will show the level of intuition required to find the match your organisation so rightly deserves, someone concerned with empowering your organisation to fulfill their mission, with the very best of career matched people.”<br>

“I have worked with Elaine on 2 separate instances providing recruitment services.  The first was to provide a temporary maternity leave replacement at my business.  <br>
Most recently she provided Executive Services to seek the replacement of a retiring President for a high profile British Columbia Not-For-Profit Organization.  In both cases, I found her to be very professional and aware of the specific (and differing) needs of our business and the Society.  She is diligent and thorough in her approach and excels in identifying quality candidates making the selection process much easier.  I highly recommend her Administrative and Executive searches.”	<br>

(candidate and client relationships) very professionally and is always willing to<br>
help in resolving recruitment issues with the highest of integrity and standards.<br>
Her expertise in friendly customer service, business savvy and retail experience<br>

“Elaine is a unique individual with people talent and the ability to manage the bottom line. Because of her experience in retail and high level management, she is able to quickly determine needs and supply strong solutions to company problems. She is warm, professional, highly capable and committed to success; an awesome business partner. I would heartily recommend her and her services in any capacity.”				<br>
	Colleen Loader                                                                         	Buyer , Books<br>
<br>
<br>
“I have a small chain of 11 hair salons in BC interior. As an absentee owner, I rely upon someone else to run the business on a day to day basis. In 2007 it became apparent that a change in management was overdue but, given that I live in Atlanta – nearly 3000 miles from my stores – I didn’t know how to find the kind of person I knew I needed. Experience in hair was not a pre-requisite. I was more interested in someone with proven retail management skills across multiple locations.<br>
<br>
I can’t remember how I came across Campbell Edgar, but I’m certainly glad that I did. Not only did they provide a list of well qualified candidates and set up convenient interviews, but Elaine “helped” me towards my eventual choice.<br>
<br>
Ross has worked out better than I dared hope. He’s brought structure and consistency to the company, while improving morale at every level. I highly commend your service and hope I never need to use you to find his replacement!” <br>

“Elaine possesses a high degree of professionalism and was quickly able to find the perfect candidate that met the needs of our company. Since our head office is located out of province it was imperative to find a company that we could trust to be knowledgeable, reliable and efficient. Campbell, Edgar Inc exceeded expectations and were extremely please with the results.&quot; <br>

“My experience of Elaine and her team has saved my bacon many many times.<br>
Sometimes you get what you expect but seldom do you get more, but with Elaine<br>
I have been pleasantly surprised.”<br>
