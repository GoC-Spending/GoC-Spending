        <br>            Berlet Electronics Ltd. is Canada&#39;s premier manufacturer of <br>radio remote controls for industry. In a short but dramatic <br>history, radio controls have become the equipment of choice for <br>directing the speed and motion of cranes, hoists and monorails. <br>They also find wide use for locomotives, rail car spotters, ship <br>loaders, transfer cars, furnace doors, mining load-hual dumpers, <br>conveyors and many other material handling applications.<br><br>At Berlet we have specialized in radio controls since the late <br>1960s. We are Canada&#39;s licensed manufacturer of the Telemotive <br>range of radio control equipment. We are ISO 9002 registered.<br><br>Our product line includes:<br><br>- Engineered radio remote-control systems<br>- Off-the shelf radio remote-control systems<br>- Laser-Guard anti-collision devices<br><br>As well as carrying an extensive radio control line, we also <br>quote on many traditional motor control applications. Our <br>systems are designed to function in the varied extremes of <br>temperature, vibration and shock as well as in the difficult <br>atmospheric conditions that are found in industrial environments.<br><br>Here are some of the industrial tasks which our radio control <br>equipment has been applied to. Even if your application is not <br>listed here, radio control could well be the best technology for <br>it.<br><br>General Manufacturing<br><br>- Auto Stamping Plants<br>- Aluminum/ Steel Material Handling<br>- Aluminum Pot Lines<br>- Aircraft Manufacturing Plants<br>- Airline Service Facilities<br>- Metal Service Center Bays<br>- Maintenance Bays<br>- Coil Handling<br>- Packaging/Shipping Docks<br>- In-Plant Equipment Movement<br>- Conveyor Lines<br>

                            SERIES 18K RADIO<br>
REMOTE CONTROL ENGINEERED SYSTEMS<br>
Series 18K system features the custom engineering of the <br>
Telemotive 8K Series system coupled with the modular design of <br>
the 10K Series. This innovative modular design is a new <br>
departure from existing engineered systems in that it offers the <br>
choice of licensed (IC Part C) or non-licensed (IC Part K) <br>
transmitter on the same basic modular platform. The standard <br>
transmitter for the 18K system is our new JLTX (joystick/lever <br>
style) transmitter that features a rugged polymer housing that <br>
can be equipped with joystick or lever controls.<br>
<br>
The 18K can be configured for combinations of stepped or <br>
stepless control and can be constructed to provide up to 64 <br>
programmable outputs. The 18K uses time multiple sharing (TMS) <br>
that allows at least four transmitters to operate on the same <br>
radio frequency. New surface-mount receivers and redesigned <br>
modular logic and output boards provide higher reliability and <br>
make the 18K easy to configure and maintain<br>
<br>
Features include:<br>
<br>
Flash memory microprocessor<br>
Frequency bands: 41 to 470 MHz<br>
Regulatory: Non-licensed, IC Part K; Licensed IC Part C<br>
Transmitter: TMS (Time Multiple Sharing)<br>
Only a single receiver is required for the following options:<br>
 Pitch and Catch Operation<br>
 Multibox operation<br>
Stepped or stepless operation<br>

                            14-K SERIES ANTI-COLLISION SYSTEM<br>
FOR OVERHEAD CRANES &amp; OTHER GUIDED MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT <br>
Laser-Guard is an advanced laser-based system that offers <br>
distance control and collision prevention for cranes or other <br>
guided machinery. It consists of a Class 1 laser <br>
transmitter/receiver, special universal mount and a reflective <br>
target.<br>
A typical application would be to mount the laser <br>
transmitter/receiver on the bridge of a crane and mount the <br>
target on the structure to be avoided.<br>
Laser-Guard will sense and measure the distance of a crane <br>
moving at up to 800 fpm, slowing it in one, two or three user-<br>
adjustable stages (to eliminate load swing), and bringing it to <br>
a halt. It is self-monitoring and includes contacts for alarms <br>
or shutdown.<br>
Safe and economical, Laser-Guard cannot be jammed by RF <br>
interference, unlike radar or other radio-based anti-collision <br>
systems<br>
<br>
System features include: <br>
- Safe Class 1 Laser Rating<br>
- Range: 5 to 150 feet<br>
- Self-monitoring with Fault Output<br>
- Accuracy: ± 10% of range measured<br>
- Easy-To-Install Reflective Target<br>
- Built-In Aiming Indicator<br>
- Rugged Mounting Assembly <br>
<br>
Laser Anti-Collision Specifications <br>

<br>
Laser-Guard has evolved from TELTEC, the unique medium-range <br>
anti-collision system in use since 1976. TELTEC is widely used <br>
throughout the world on cab, pendant and radio-operated cranes <br>
to prevent collisions over a range of 10 to 100 feet.<br>
Users in a wide variety of industries have already improved <br>
employee safety, reduced product liability, and avoided damage <br>
to machinery. In the same way that TELTEC has shown itself to be <br>
low-cost insurance, Laser Guard will continue to safeguard <br>
valuable equipment even more effectively.<br>

                            WIRELESS TELEMETRY CONTROL WITH THE 12-K SERIES <br>
INSTACON 12-K is a two-way digital radio telemetry control <br>
system that replaces wired control systems. It provides <br>
confirmation, via a wireless link, that a requested function has <br>
been done. Wire links, which are costly to maintain, are <br>
replaced by INSTACON 12-K, to increase operator and machine <br>
efficiency and safety.<br>
A typical INSTACON 12-K system consists of two or more <br>
transceivers. One transceiver controls the functions of a <br>
machine via a digital radio link. Once the requested function is <br>
done, the second transceiver radios back a confirmation to the <br>
operator.<br>
<br>
Here are the highlights: <br>
<br>
- Microprocessor-Controlled Receivers<br>
- Time Multiple Sharing (TMS)<br>
- Replaces Wire Links<br>
- Reduces Installation &amp; Maintenance Costs<br>
- VHF Band Operation<br>
- Easy Interface to Controlled Machine<br>
- Provides Positive Function Indication<br>
- Multiple Units May Be Combined <br>
<br>
INSTACON 12-K applications include mobile side loaders and <br>
straddle cranes that handle intermodal freight containers in <br>
railroad yards and marine terminals.<br>
Before, control of the spreader bar was via a wired line, which <br>
spooled off a reel as the container moved. This spooling action <br>
could cause many failures due to constant movement in a harsh <br>
environment. INSTACON 12-K replaces these wire-control links, <br>
reducing installation costs and improving reliability while <br>
providing a positive measure of control even when the operator <br>
is unsighted from the machine function.<br>
Other applications include: remote control of valves in <br>
irrigation systems, oil and gas pipelines and refineries; and <br>
control of conveyors, bucket loaders, and hopper loaders in <br>
quarry, mine and grain processing operations.<br>

                            REMOTE AIR/HYDRAULIC BRIDGE BRAKE CONVERSION KIT <br>
The Telemotive RC-EAH-1 AC and DC Air/Hydraulic Bridge Brake <br>
Conversion Kit makes it possible to operate a hydraulic foot <br>
pedal type of bridge brake remotely by radio or pendant. This <br>
type of control, similar to automotive braking, is generally <br>
acknowledged to offer more sensitive bridge braking than does an <br>
electric bridge brake.<br>
<br>
Automatic braking for the bridge motion of an overhead traveling <br>
crane becomes essential when converting a crane from cab <br>
operation to radio remote control or pendant. Without automatic <br>
braking, a loss of power would allow the crane to coast to a <br>
stop, proving hazardous in certain conditions.<br>
Implementing the Telemotive remote bridge brake conversion kit <br>
from Berlet will provide the same braking capability from the <br>
floor as is available from the cab. Our remotely controlled <br>
air/hydraulic brake package will interface with any existing <br>
hydraulic brake system when converting any Electric Overhead <br>
Traveling crane to radio remote or pendant control.<br>
<br>
The Telemotive remote controlled brake system features an <br>
automatic service brake mode which is controlled by bridge <br>
movement and a power-off emergency brake mode. Either the <br>
service brake or emergency brake can also be controlled by <br>
operator command if required. Both control modes are field <br>
adjustable for optimum brake operation on the crane. Brake <br>
pressures are constant after initial startup and installation. <br>
The only other adjustment is monitoring proper brake shoe <br>
adjustments.<br>
<br>
Telemotive also offers two alternate control mechanisms. First, <br>
by adding a third solenoid, 3-step radio controlled braking is <br>
available. Second, by replacing the service brake solenoid with <br>
a proportional transducer, radio-controlled proportional braking <br>
of the crane is available.<br>
<br>
Any existing manual hydraulic brake system can easily be <br>
converted to the Telemotive remote-controlled brake package by <br>
installing the pre-engineered and pre-assembled control panel <br>
and compressor assembly on the crane bridge and interconnecting <br>
the necessary additional hydraulic tubing and electrical wiring. <br>
The remote-controlled system must also have a brake fluid <br>
bleeder/reservoir. If this bleeder/reservoir is not used with <br>
the existing manual brake system, it must be included as part of <br>
the new remote control package.<br>
<br>
If the crane you are considering converting to radio remote <br>
control has a hydraulic brake, regardless of manufacturer, you <br>
can confidently rely on Berlets experienced engineers to assist <br>
you ... and at a cost far less than anywhere else in the <br>
marketplace. <br>

              PINPOINT PRECISION THROUGH STEPLESS CONTROL <br>
ACHIEVED BY HEAVY EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER<br>
The benefits of radio remote control are evident <br>
not just in terms of speed and accuracy but also <br>
in terms of load-handling accuracy. One major <br>
manufacturer of heavy construction equipment <br>
recently took advantage of this feature by <br>
adapting two of its cranes to stepless control, <br>
then upgrading the radio remote to the 10-K <br>
series. The controls on the two 80-foot-span <br>
cranes make it possible to swiftly and safely <br>
manoeuver large engine assemblies into and out of <br>
tightly confined noise-suppressing test cells. <br>
Operators find the transmitter to be comfortable, <br>
familiar and compatible with their earlier radio <br>
remote systems. Thanks to the dynamic braking <br>
afforded by the stepless motor controls, they <br>
also report fewer maintenance problems. Enclosed <br>
in a lightweight aluminum case with concealed <br>
antenna, the transmitter may be powered by either <br>
disposable battery packs or rechargeable cells.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ANTI-COLLISION SYSTEMS WILL PREVENT MISHAPS WITH <br>
OTHER PLANT MACHINERY<br>
<br>
When a machine tool manufacturer learned that a <br>
collision in another company&#39;s plant between an <br>
overhead crane and a piece of equipment had <br>
caused $300 000 of damage, it determined to take <br>
precautionary action. Thanks to the installation <br>
of an anti-collision system, the plant avoided <br>
the threat effectively and economically. The <br>
obstruction in the plant was a machining mill <br>
column. In its upward position it extends <br>
directly into the travel path of two 77 foot span <br>
overhead cranes. By equipping the machining mill <br>
with a low-frequency transmitter, it can signal <br>
its presence to the cranes. For their part, the <br>
cranes slow down and stop before impact but can <br>
move off in the reverse direction at full speed. <br>
More conventionally, Laser Anti-Collision devices <br>
by Berlet are used for preventing cranes from <br>
colliding with each other. Cranes themselves can <br>
be operated with any of the Berlet &#39;K&#39; Series <br>
radio control devices independent of the anti-<br>
collision system.<br>

REMOTE CONTROL ENGINEERED SYSTEMS<br>
Series 18K system features the custom engineering of the <br>
Telemotive 8K Series system coupled with the modular design of <br>
the 10K Series. This innovative modular design is a new <br>
departure from existing engineered systems in that it offers the <br>
choice of licensed (IC Part C) or non-licensed (IC Part K) <br>
transmitter on the same basic modular platform. The standard <br>
transmitter for the 18K system is our new JLTX (joystick/lever <br>
style) transmitter that features a rugged polymer housing that <br>
can be equipped with joystick or lever controls.<br>
<br>
The 18K can be configured for combinations of stepped or <br>
stepless control and can be constructed to provide up to 64 <br>
programmable outputs. The 18K uses time multiple sharing (TMS) <br>

                            14-K SERIES ANTI-COLLISION SYSTEM<br>
FOR OVERHEAD CRANES &amp; OTHER GUIDED MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT <br>
Laser-Guard is an advanced laser-based system that offers <br>
distance control and collision prevention for cranes or other <br>
guided machinery. It consists of a Class 1 laser <br>
transmitter/receiver, special universal mount and a reflective <br>
target.<br>
A typical application would be to mount the laser <br>
transmitter/receiver on the bridge of a crane and mount the <br>
target on the structure to be avoided.<br>
Laser-Guard will sense and measure the distance of a crane <br>
moving at up to 800 fpm, slowing it in one, two or three user-<br>
adjustable stages (to eliminate load swing), and bringing it to <br>
a halt. It is self-monitoring and includes contacts for alarms <br>
or shutdown.<br>
Safe and economical, Laser-Guard cannot be jammed by RF <br>
interference, unlike radar or other radio-based anti-collision <br>
systems<br>
<br>
System features include: <br>
- Safe Class 1 Laser Rating<br>
- Range: 5 to 150 feet<br>
- Self-monitoring with Fault Output<br>
- Accuracy: ± 10% of range measured<br>
- Easy-To-Install Reflective Target<br>
- Built-In Aiming Indicator<br>
- Rugged Mounting Assembly <br>
<br>
Laser Anti-Collision Specifications <br>
- Power requirements: 120/240 vAC, 47-60 Hz, 180-260vDC, 10-12 <br>
vDC, special voltages on request.<br>
- Range 5-150 feet with 3 independently adjustable outputs or <br>
set points: 5 - 40 ft, 40 - 70 ft, 50 - 100 ft. An optional <br>
relay interface panel provides a timed bypass on activation of <br>
the third set point, allowing operation close to a wall or <br>
another crane. Each set point may be adjusted within its range, <br>
with an accuracy of ± 10%.<br>
- Temperature: -30 to +70 degrees C<br>
- Outputs: Standard single pole, normally open or normally <br>
closed relays are used. Contact rating is 5 amps, 110 vAC, 60 Hz <br>
resistive. Note: If any contactors to be controlled by this <br>
device exceed this rating, interposing relays must be installed<br>
- Optional Interface Panels: Additional interface panels are <br>
available for 480 vAC and 250 vDC.<br>
- Enclosure: Standard system enclosure is NEMA 12; other <br>
enclosures available on request.<br>
- Laser: Class 1 <br>
<br>
Laser-Guard has evolved from TELTEC, the unique medium-range <br>
anti-collision system in use since 1976. TELTEC is widely used <br>
throughout the world on cab, pendant and radio-operated cranes <br>
to prevent collisions over a range of 10 to 100 feet.<br>
Users in a wide variety of industries have already improved <br>
employee safety, reduced product liability, and avoided damage <br>
to machinery. In the same way that TELTEC has shown itself to be <br>
low-cost insurance, Laser Guard will continue to safeguard <br>
valuable equipment even more effectively.<br>

                            WIRELESS TELEMETRY CONTROL WITH THE 12-K SERIES <br>
INSTACON 12-K is a two-way digital radio telemetry control <br>
system that replaces wired control systems. It provides <br>
confirmation, via a wireless link, that a requested function has <br>
been done. Wire links, which are costly to maintain, are <br>
replaced by INSTACON 12-K, to increase operator and machine <br>
efficiency and safety.<br>
A typical INSTACON 12-K system consists of two or more <br>
transceivers. One transceiver controls the functions of a <br>
machine via a digital radio link. Once the requested function is <br>
done, the second transceiver radios back a confirmation to the <br>
operator.<br>
<br>
Here are the highlights: <br>
<br>
- Microprocessor-Controlled Receivers<br>
- Time Multiple Sharing (TMS)<br>
- Replaces Wire Links<br>
- Reduces Installation &amp; Maintenance Costs<br>
- VHF Band Operation<br>
- Easy Interface to Controlled Machine<br>
- Provides Positive Function Indication<br>
- Multiple Units May Be Combined <br>
<br>
INSTACON 12-K applications include mobile side loaders and <br>
straddle cranes that handle intermodal freight containers in <br>
railroad yards and marine terminals.<br>
Before, control of the spreader bar was via a wired line, which <br>
spooled off a reel as the container moved. This spooling action <br>
could cause many failures due to constant movement in a harsh <br>
environment. INSTACON 12-K replaces these wire-control links, <br>
reducing installation costs and improving reliability while <br>
providing a positive measure of control even when the operator <br>
is unsighted from the machine function.<br>
Other applications include: remote control of valves in <br>
irrigation systems, oil and gas pipelines and refineries; and <br>
control of conveyors, bucket loaders, and hopper loaders in <br>
quarry, mine and grain processing operations.<br>

<br>
Automatic braking for the bridge motion of an overhead traveling <br>
crane becomes essential when converting a crane from cab <br>
operation to radio remote control or pendant. Without automatic <br>
braking, a loss of power would allow the crane to coast to a <br>
stop, proving hazardous in certain conditions.<br>
Implementing the Telemotive remote bridge brake conversion kit <br>
from Berlet will provide the same braking capability from the <br>
floor as is available from the cab. Our remotely controlled <br>
air/hydraulic brake package will interface with any existing <br>
hydraulic brake system when converting any Electric Overhead <br>
Traveling crane to radio remote or pendant control.<br>
<br>
The Telemotive remote controlled brake system features an <br>
automatic service brake mode which is controlled by bridge <br>
movement and a power-off emergency brake mode. Either the <br>
service brake or emergency brake can also be controlled by <br>
operator command if required. Both control modes are field <br>
adjustable for optimum brake operation on the crane. Brake <br>
pressures are constant after initial startup and installation. <br>
The only other adjustment is monitoring proper brake shoe <br>
adjustments.<br>
<br>
Telemotive also offers two alternate control mechanisms. First, <br>
by adding a third solenoid, 3-step radio controlled braking is <br>
available. Second, by replacing the service brake solenoid with <br>
a proportional transducer, radio-controlled proportional braking <br>
of the crane is available.<br>
<br>
Any existing manual hydraulic brake system can easily be <br>
converted to the Telemotive remote-controlled brake package by <br>
installing the pre-engineered and pre-assembled control panel <br>
and compressor assembly on the crane bridge and interconnecting <br>
the necessary additional hydraulic tubing and electrical wiring. <br>
The remote-controlled system must also have a brake fluid <br>
bleeder/reservoir. If this bleeder/reservoir is not used with <br>
the existing manual brake system, it must be included as part of <br>
the new remote control package.<br>
<br>
If the crane you are considering converting to radio remote <br>
control has a hydraulic brake, regardless of manufacturer, you <br>
can confidently rely on Berlets experienced engineers to assist <br>
you ... and at a cost far less than anywhere else in the <br>
marketplace. <br>

              PINPOINT PRECISION THROUGH STEPLESS CONTROL <br>
ACHIEVED BY HEAVY EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER<br>
The benefits of radio remote control are evident <br>
not just in terms of speed and accuracy but also <br>
in terms of load-handling accuracy. One major <br>
manufacturer of heavy construction equipment <br>
recently took advantage of this feature by <br>
adapting two of its cranes to stepless control, <br>
then upgrading the radio remote to the 10-K <br>
series. The controls on the two 80-foot-span <br>
cranes make it possible to swiftly and safely <br>
manoeuver large engine assemblies into and out of <br>
tightly confined noise-suppressing test cells. <br>
Operators find the transmitter to be comfortable, <br>
familiar and compatible with their earlier radio <br>
remote systems. Thanks to the dynamic braking <br>
afforded by the stepless motor controls, they <br>
also report fewer maintenance problems. Enclosed <br>
in a lightweight aluminum case with concealed <br>
antenna, the transmitter may be powered by either <br>
disposable battery packs or rechargeable cells.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ANTI-COLLISION SYSTEMS WILL PREVENT MISHAPS WITH <br>
OTHER PLANT MACHINERY<br>
<br>
When a machine tool manufacturer learned that a <br>
collision in another company&#39;s plant between an <br>
overhead crane and a piece of equipment had <br>
caused $300 000 of damage, it determined to take <br>
precautionary action. Thanks to the installation <br>
of an anti-collision system, the plant avoided <br>
the threat effectively and economically. The <br>
obstruction in the plant was a machining mill <br>
column. In its upward position it extends <br>
directly into the travel path of two 77 foot span <br>
overhead cranes. By equipping the machining mill <br>
with a low-frequency transmitter, it can signal <br>
its presence to the cranes. For their part, the <br>
cranes slow down and stop before impact but can <br>
move off in the reverse direction at full speed. <br>
More conventionally, Laser Anti-Collision devices <br>
by Berlet are used for preventing cranes from <br>
colliding with each other. Cranes themselves can <br>
be operated with any of the Berlet &#39;K&#39; Series <br>
radio control devices independent of the anti-<br>
collision system.<br>
