                            Description of Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)<br>
<br>
Tires operating below inflation standards put the overall performance of your vehicle and the safety of your passengers at risk. The Tire Pressure Monitoring System helps increase your safety on the road by improving your vehicle’s maneuverability, decreasing the tread wear of your tires, reducing your vehicle’s braking distance, and improving your vehicle’s fuel economy. There are two types of Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems in existence today—Direct and Indirect. A Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring System uses sensors on the inside tire assembly to transmit tire pressure information to your vehicle’s computer. An Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System gauges tire pressure through your vehicle’s Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) by using speed sensors to measure the rotational speed of each wheel (as tire pressure decreases, the rolling distance decreases, and the rotational speed increases). All TPMS systems require regular maintenance in order to meet maximum performance standards, which requires all vehicles to be equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System.<br>
Benefits of Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)<br>
<br>
Your vehicle’s Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) continuously monitors the air pressure in your tires. When there is an instance of low tire pressure, or if the tire pressure drops below the manufacturer’s recommended level of tire pressure, the TPMS will detect and report the discrepancy by illuminating an indicator light on the dashboard of your vehicle. When the TPMS light flashes on the dashboard, you should check your tire pressure, inflate the affected tire to the level indicated by the manufacturer, or bring your vehicle into our shop so that the issue can be remedied by our expert staff. During a TPMS maintenance service, our service staff will run a series of tests to ensure that the system is operating both correctly and at maximum efficiency. If our technicians uncover damage to the system or its accompanying components, they may need to replace valve cores, valve nuts, seals, seal washers, or valve caps. If you are in need of TPMS repairs, maintenance, or replacement services, or if you are in need of a TPMS installation service, then contact us today.<br>

                            Description of Wheel Services<br>
<br>
Many of today’s wheels are cast or forged and made out of steel, aluminum, or aluminum alloy. Casting consists of pouring liquid metal into a mold, while forging consists of heating and machining a wheel into shape through the use of CNC lathing equipment. Anatomy-wise, the center section of a wheel contains a bolt pattern and mounting holes that are used to attach the wheel to a vehicle. The outermost lip of the wheel is known as the flange. The flange, located on the edge of the wheel, is flared to form the bead seat, which holds the tire and maintains an airtight seal. Safety humps are small elevations on the inside of the bead seat, which prevent the tire from falling into the drop center portion of the wheel in case a blowout occurs. This innovation allows drivers to maintain directional control of a vehicle with deflated tires. The drop center is the section of the wheel with a smaller diameter than the rest of the wheel. The drop center provides a means for installing and removing a tire. If you are looking for a one-stop wheel and rim shop, you have come to the right place. Our staff is comprised of wheel fitment and installation experts ready to help you find the perfect wheel.<br>

                            The Basics Behind Computerized Wheel Balancing Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
Professionals use computerized wheel balancers to pinpoint weight differentiation within a tire and wheel assembly. Computerized wheel balancers are highly accurate machines that identify the weight distribution problem areas within an assembly. Ideally, a tire and its wheel should complement one-another, with both maintaining an equal amount of weight throughout the assembly. In a perfect assembly, air will be even throughout the tire, and the wheel will be perfectly round in shape. However, tires and wheels are nearly never perfect. In fact, some tire manufacturers mark the lightest part of a tire so that drivers can easily match it to the heaviest part of the wheel. Both time and normal tire and wheel usage will also gradually add imbalance to a tire and wheel assembly’s weight distribution. The smallest difference in weight within an assembly can cause a great amount of damage and annoyance. A computerized wheel balancing service will return the balance of your car or truck’s wheels to factory specifications.<br>
Why Should You Have Computerized Wheel Balancing Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
Tire and wheel assemblies are prone to various weight discrepancies that can cause a multitude of problems for motorists. If you experience vibrations in your vehicle, hear squeals from your tires, or feel your vehicle pulling in one direction, then one or more of your tire and wheel assemblies may be in need of rebalancing. Fortunately, our staff is here to help with all your balancing needs. During this process, our experts will mount your wheel on the computerized wheel balancing machine and spin it. Acting upon the information we receive from our computerized wheel balancing equipment, our service staff will apply additional weight to the indicated areas in order to alleviate vibrations and help the assembly roll more smoothly. With your tires and wheels properly balanced, you can enjoy an overall smoother ride, greater control, and longer lasting tires.<br>

                            he Basics Behind Tire Purchase &amp; Tire Installation Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
When tires are completely worn or unable to meet a driver’s needs, the tire purchasing and installation process usually follows. The specific reasons why a motorist might want to purchase new tires when the current set of tires isn&#39;t worn will vary. A vehicle towing heavy weight will need tires with a high load rating. If a vehicle is driven in an area with heavy rain, the driver might prefer to purchase new tires that offer a better traction rating. During our tire purchase and installation service, our service staff will conduct a thorough investigation of your driving needs to help guarantee the best possible set of tires for your car or truck. Once a driver buys the new tires, they will need to be correctly installed on the vehicle. Contact us today to learn more about our tire offerings or feel free to browse our online tire catalog.<br>
Why Should You Have Tire Purchase &amp; Tire Installation Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
If your tires are worn or unsatisfactory, consider purchasing and installing new ones through us. When tires are worn, they won’t perform correctly. Worn tires heat up more quickly, puncture more easily, and take on roads less effectively. They may also emerge as a potential danger to their driver and other motorists. However, worn tires aren’t the only reason to install new tires. Depending on your environment and needs, it may be wise to purchase and install new tires even if your current set is okay. This is because using tires that are unfit for your needs can quickly deteriorate them. If you need assistance finding the right tire, our expert staff can help. When you’re ready to make a purchase or install a new set of tires, let us know.<br>

                            The Basics Behind Tire Rotation Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
Our tire rotation service involves changing the position of a vehicle’s tires in order to reduce massive tread differentiation between them. Tires tend to exhibit differing amounts of tread wear, because each tire does not deal with exactly the same types or amounts of stress as its companions. Motorists rotate their tires because this is an effective way to deal with uneven tread wear. By alternating tires according to tire rotation patterns, drivers can help distribute tread wear more evenly and reduce uneven tread wear. Depending upon the type of vehicle a motorist drives and the type of tires on the vehicle, the tire rotation pattern may vary. Rotation experts may exchange the front tires with one-another, switch the rear tires with one-another, or swap the front and rear tires. If the vehicle has a full-size matching spare tire, it may also be included in the rotation cycle.<br>
Why Should You Have Tire Rotation Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
You should rotate your tires to prevent uneven tread wear. Uneven tread commonly occurs because most vehicles do not distribute weight evenly between the front and rear tires. In general, front tires tend to deteriorate more quickly than rear tires due to their location and the weight of a vehicle’s engine. By rotating your tires, you’ll distribute the wear more evenly, and you won’t need to replace your tires as frequently. Beyond the benefit of extended tread life, routine and professional tire rotation services can also improve your gas mileage. This is because well-maintained tires reduce rolling resistance, which affects your vehicle’s performance and gas mileage. Our tire rotation service can help prevent massive tread differentiation between tires, encourage better vehicular performance, and save you money by contributing to better gas mileage. If you have questions about how often you should rotate your tires, simply ask a member of our service staff.<br>

                            The Basics Behind Tire Repair Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
There are many hazards that can make tires less effective and more of a danger to drivers and passengers. It is not uncommon for a sharp stone, nail, or other pointed piece of debris to puncture a tire. Because flat tires are dangerous to use, it is advised that motorists only drive on them in extreme circumstances, such as when they need to reach safety from a busy highway. It is also important to note that the longer a driver uses a flat tire, the more unlikely it becomes that a tire repair service can be performed. This is because riding on a flat tire for too long can cause irrevocable damage to the tire. As the tire deflates, the wheel will come into closer contact with the ground, potentially damaging the rim. It is important to understand that tire repair is time sensitive. The sooner you are able to bring a lightly to moderately damaged tire in for repair, the more likely it is that the tire can be saved.<br>
Why Should You Have Tire Repair Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
The methods used by our service staff to repair a tire comply with the Rubber Manufacturer’s Association (RMA). The RMA states that a flat tire can be repaired if the puncture is ¼ inch or smaller and if the puncture is located on the tread of a tire. They recommend that the tire repair procedure involve a plug and a patch on the lining of the tire. A plug and a patch can add thousands of miles more to a damaged tire. For a punctured tire, our staff will patch, plug, or seal the damaged area. If your tire is losing air due to valve stem damage or if the tire is not securely attached to the wheel’s rim, our tire repair service staff will be able to help. Ultimately, repairing your tire helps to keep you safe on the road and can save you money in the long run.<br>

                            Description of Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)<br>
<br>
Tires operating below inflation standards put the overall performance of your vehicle and the safety of your passengers at risk. The Tire Pressure Monitoring System helps increase your safety on the road by improving your vehicle’s maneuverability, decreasing the tread wear of your tires, reducing your vehicle’s braking distance, and improving your vehicle’s fuel economy. There are two types of Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems in existence today—Direct and Indirect. A Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring System uses sensors on the inside tire assembly to transmit tire pressure information to your vehicle’s computer. An Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System gauges tire pressure through your vehicle’s Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) by using speed sensors to measure the rotational speed of each wheel (as tire pressure decreases, the rolling distance decreases, and the rotational speed increases). All TPMS systems require regular maintenance in order to meet maximum performance standards, which requires all vehicles to be equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System.<br>
Benefits of Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)<br>
<br>
Your vehicle’s Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) continuously monitors the air pressure in your tires. When there is an instance of low tire pressure, or if the tire pressure drops below the manufacturer’s recommended level of tire pressure, the TPMS will detect and report the discrepancy by illuminating an indicator light on the dashboard of your vehicle. When the TPMS light flashes on the dashboard, you should check your tire pressure, inflate the affected tire to the level indicated by the manufacturer, or bring your vehicle into our shop so that the issue can be remedied by our expert staff. During a TPMS maintenance service, our service staff will run a series of tests to ensure that the system is operating both correctly and at maximum efficiency. If our technicians uncover damage to the system or its accompanying components, they may need to replace valve cores, valve nuts, seals, seal washers, or valve caps.

                            Description of Wheel Services<br>
<br>
Many of today’s wheels are cast or forged and made out of steel, aluminum, or aluminum alloy. Casting consists of pouring liquid metal into a mold, while forging consists of heating and machining a wheel into shape through the use of CNC lathing equipment. Anatomy-wise, the center section of a wheel contains a bolt pattern and mounting holes that are used to attach the wheel to a vehicle. The outermost lip of the wheel is known as the flange. The flange, located on the edge of the wheel, is flared to form the bead seat, which holds the tire and maintains an airtight seal. Safety humps are small elevations on the inside of the bead seat, which prevent the tire from falling into the drop center portion of the wheel in case a blowout occurs. This innovation allows drivers to maintain directional control of a vehicle with deflated tires. The drop center is the section of the wheel with a smaller diameter than the rest of the wheel. The drop center provides a means for installing and removing a tire. If you are looking for a one-stop wheel and rim shop, you have come to the right place. Our staff is comprised of wheel fitment and installation experts ready to help you find the perfect wheel.<br>

                            The Basics Behind Computerized Wheel Balancing Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
Professionals use computerized wheel balancers to pinpoint weight differentiation within a tire and wheel assembly. Computerized wheel balancers are highly accurate machines that identify the weight distribution problem areas within an assembly. Ideally, a tire and its wheel should complement one-another, with both maintaining an equal amount of weight throughout the assembly. In a perfect assembly, air will be even throughout the tire, and the wheel will be perfectly round in shape. However, tires and wheels are nearly never perfect. In fact, some tire manufacturers mark the lightest part of a tire so that drivers can easily match it to the heaviest part of the wheel. Both time and normal tire and wheel usage will also gradually add imbalance to a tire and wheel assembly’s weight distribution. The smallest difference in weight within an assembly can cause a great amount of damage and annoyance. A computerized wheel balancing service will return the balance of your car or truck’s wheels to factory specifications.<br>
Why Should You Have Computerized Wheel Balancing Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
Tire and wheel assemblies are prone to various weight discrepancies that can cause a multitude of problems for motorists. If you experience vibrations in your vehicle, hear squeals from your tires, or feel your vehicle pulling in one direction, then one or more of your tire and wheel assemblies may be in need of rebalancing. Fortunately, our staff is here to help with all your balancing needs. During this process, our experts will mount your wheel on the computerized wheel balancing machine and spin it. Acting upon the information we receive from our computerized wheel balancing equipment, our service staff will apply additional weight to the indicated areas in order to alleviate vibrations and help the assembly roll more smoothly. With your tires and wheels properly balanced, you can enjoy an overall smoother ride, greater control, and longer lasting tires.<br>

                            he Basics Behind Tire Purchase &amp; Tire Installation Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
When tires are completely worn or unable to meet a driver’s needs, the tire purchasing and installation process usually follows. The specific reasons why a motorist might want to purchase new tires when the current set of tires isn&#39;t worn will vary. A vehicle towing heavy weight will need tires with a high load rating. If a vehicle is driven in an area with heavy rain, the driver might prefer to purchase new tires that offer a better traction rating. During our tire purchase and installation service, our service staff will conduct a thorough investigation of your driving needs to help guarantee the best possible set of tires for your car or truck. Once a driver buys the new tires, they will need to be correctly installed on the vehicle. Contact us today to learn more about our tire offerings or feel free to browse our online tire catalog.<br>
Why Should You Have Tire Purchase &amp; Tire Installation Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
If your tires are worn or unsatisfactory, consider purchasing and installing new ones through us. When tires are worn, they won’t perform correctly. Worn tires heat up more quickly, puncture more easily, and take on roads less effectively. They may also emerge as a potential danger to their driver and other motorists. However, worn tires aren’t the only reason to install new tires. Depending on your environment and needs, it may be wise to purchase and install new tires even if your current set is okay. This is because using tires that are unfit for your needs can quickly deteriorate them. If you need assistance finding the right tire, our expert staff can help. When you’re ready to make a purchase or install a new set of tires, let us know.<br>

                            The Basics Behind Tire Rotation Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
Our tire rotation service involves changing the position of a vehicle’s tires in order to reduce massive tread differentiation between them. Tires tend to exhibit differing amounts of tread wear, because each tire does not deal with exactly the same types or amounts of stress as its companions. Motorists rotate their tires because this is an effective way to deal with uneven tread wear. By alternating tires according to tire rotation patterns, drivers can help distribute tread wear more evenly and reduce uneven tread wear. Depending upon the type of vehicle a motorist drives and the type of tires on the vehicle, the tire rotation pattern may vary. Rotation experts may exchange the front tires with one-another, switch the rear tires with one-another, or swap the front and rear tires. If the vehicle has a full-size matching spare tire, it may also be included in the rotation cycle.<br>
Why Should You Have Tire Rotation Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
You should rotate your tires to prevent uneven tread wear. Uneven tread commonly occurs because most vehicles do not distribute weight evenly between the front and rear tires. In general, front tires tend to deteriorate more quickly than rear tires due to their location and the weight of a vehicle’s engine. By rotating your tires, you’ll distribute the wear more evenly, and you won’t need to replace your tires as frequently. Beyond the benefit of extended tread life, routine and professional tire rotation services can also improve your gas mileage. This is because well-maintained tires reduce rolling resistance, which affects your vehicle’s performance and gas mileage. Our tire rotation service can help prevent massive tread differentiation between tires, encourage better vehicular performance, and save you money by contributing to better gas mileage. If you have questions about how often you should rotate your tires, simply ask a member of our service staff.<br>

                            The Basics Behind Tire Repair Services at JoTires<br>
<br>
There are many hazards that can make tires less effective and more of a danger to drivers and passengers. It is not uncommon for a sharp stone, nail, or other pointed piece of debris to puncture a tire. Because flat tires are dangerous to use, it is advised that motorists only drive on them in extreme circumstances, such as when they need to reach safety from a busy highway. It is also important to note that the longer a driver uses a flat tire, the more unlikely it becomes that a tire repair service can be performed. This is because riding on a flat tire for too long can cause irrevocable damage to the tire. As the tire deflates, the wheel will come into closer contact with the ground, potentially damaging the rim. It is important to understand that tire repair is time sensitive. The sooner you are able to bring a lightly to moderately damaged tire in for repair, the more likely it is that the tire can be saved.<br>
Why Should You Have Tire Repair Services Performed at JoTires?<br>
<br>
The methods used by our service staff to repair a tire comply with the Rubber Manufacturer’s Association (RMA). The RMA states that a flat tire can be repaired if the puncture is ¼ inch or smaller and if the puncture is located on the tread of a tire. They recommend that the tire repair procedure involve a plug and a patch on the lining of the tire. A plug and a patch can add thousands of miles more to a damaged tire. For a punctured tire, our staff will patch, plug, or seal the damaged area. If your tire is losing air due to valve stem damage or if the tire is not securely attached to the wheel’s rim, our tire repair service staff will be able to help. Ultimately, repairing your tire helps to keep you safe on the road and can save you money in the long run.<br>
