                            Our coating technology utilizes nanoscale effects to chemically attach a ceramic layer to a polymer substrate, thus achieving anti-scratch capabilities. We can also use this approach to attach other types of layers to give desired optical and tribological capabilities.Our technology has the following benefits:<br>
	Less porosity than coatings prepared by sol-gel methods. The porosity in a sol-gel film is dependent on the interstitial spaces left by the sol particles. However, in our process there is no sol formation, thus the porosity is exclusively controlled by the chemical kinetics of the process itself. Reduced porosity results in higher wear resistance.<br>
	Stronger adhesion of the coating to the substrate since there is a chemical bond instead of the physical interaction resulting from many other processes.<br>
	Favourable temperature and pressure conditions during manufacturing versus other methods such as chemical vapour deposition, sputtering, thermal oxidation, plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition, or flame hydrolysis. Our process is largely carried out at room conditions using simple, economical equipment.<br>
	Flexibility to use a variety of application methods thus making it easier to integrate the coating into existing manufacturing processes.<br>
	Environmentally friendly since the water used in the process can be easily treated, the raw materials have low vapour pressures thus minimizing evaporation losses, and the VOC values are very low.<br>
	Economical raw materials, typically costing US$ 40-50 per litre. Depending on the coating thickness, a litre of our coating covers 4 to 8 square meters. Also, the raw materials are easily available in bulk, at a consistent quality, from a variety of sources. These costs are based on lab development  there should be potential for significant reduction in these costs for manufacturing due to economies of scale.<br>
<br>
We are looking for partners who are interested in further development and commercialization of our technology, either to use it internally or to sell it for third parties. To lower the partners risk, our business model is to cover our direct costs during development in exchange for ongoing revenue after commercialization.<br>

                            Our technology uses a biopolymer called keratin as a filler to reinforce polymers thereby improving the thermal and structural properties. We have demonstrated our technology in the lab, primarily on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) but also with other polymers. Our technology has the following benefits:<br>
	Keratin is a natural hydrophobic biopolymer (as opposed to cellulose which is hydrophilic) and is thus better suited as a reinforcing agent for those applications where water entering the composite can lead to its degradation. Our experiments indicated that the measured contact angle of water with the keratin biofiber surface is around 90°.<br>
	Keratins well ordered structure gives it high tensile strength even before being added to a composite. Keratin essentially heals itself when subjected to a mechanical load due to structural rearrangements in the molecular chain.<br>
	Keratin biofibers have a high aspect ratio (length / diameter) of approximately 350, supporting effective load transfer from the matrix to the fibre.<br>
	The Youngs modulus of the composite showed significant improvement of around 66% compared to pure cast-prepared PMMA.  Other mechanical characteristics such as such as tensile strength also showed significant improvement.<br>
	A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study showed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased with the biofiber content due to an increase in the rigidity at a molecular level caused by the polypeptide chains joining with the PMMA. For standard PMMA the Tg is 72 °C compared to 109 °C for the 5% biofiber composite.<br>
	A thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the reinforced PMMA showed a decomposition temperature above 300 °C, compared to approximately 175 °C for standard PMMA. This analysis also showed that the 30% weight loss temperature increased from 269 °C for standard PMMA to approximately 330 °C for the 5% biofiber composite.<br>
	Keratins dispersion properties are such that there is no need for chemical compatibilization between the fibres and the PMMA matrix. However, by grafting the polymer onto the keratin we were able to improve the mechanical and thermal behaviour of the resulting composite.<br>
	Keratin fibres are available from renewable sources. Currently, keratin from animal processing is largely viewed as waste. Productively using this waste is both environmentally friendly and a potential source of joint benefit with the animal processing industry.<br>
	There should be minimal changes to current production techniques, involving some functionalization and preparation of both the filler and the matrix. The other materials that our process requires are available in bulk at relatively low prices.<br>
	There are many potential applications for this technology since both mechanical and thermal properties of the polymers were improved.<br>

We are looking for partners who are interested in further development and commercialization of our technology, either to use it internally or to sell it for third parties. To lower the partners risk, our business model is to cover our direct costs during development in exchange for ongoing revenue after commercialization.<br>

                            We have developed a coating that can be applied to a variety of substrates (e.g. metal, plastic, rubber) and that allows for easy removal of dried on paint, even if the paint has been baked e.g. in the hot sun. The coating is quite thin (order of 10 micrometers) and durable. The current version is solvent based but we are confident we can create a water based version with minimal development. Our coating is cost effective since we use uses inexpensive components such as commercially available nanoparticles. We have several pictures and movies demonstrating the coating.<br>

We are open for discussions with two types of partners:<br>
1.  Those who are interested in using this coating. We would jointly do some additional development to tailor it for the specific need and then determine the most effective way to manufacture it.<br>

                            We have technology for anti-icing coatings for which we are looking for development partners.  An initial version of this coating resulted in a reduction in ice adhesion by a factor of 4 compared to bare aluminum as tested by an independent lab.  We are confident that with further development we could increase the capability of this coating.  The coating has special potential where any reduction in adhesion is helpful and where large areas have to be covered.  Our coating is cost effective since we use uses inexpensive components such as commercially available nanoparticles.<br>
<br>
We are looking for partners who can provide technical assistance and/or funding.  The technical assistance we are looking for is a deep understanding of the science of ice - we are coatings experts, not ice experts.  For funding, this could be either potential customers or coating manufacturers.  Our lab rates are very competitive and our business model is to only cover our direct costs for development in exchange for ongoing revenue after commercialization.  This approach significantly lowers the financial risk for a partner.<br>

We work with our customers to understand their needs and then in a step by step fashion develop the coatings to meet their needs.  To lower the customer&#39;s risk, our business model is to cover our direct costs during development in exchange for ongoing revenue after commercialization.<br>

                            Our coating technology utilizes nanoscale effects to chemically attach a ceramic layer to a polymer substrate, thus achieving anti-scratch capabilities. We can also use this approach to attach other types of layers to give desired optical and tribological capabilities.Our technology has the following benefits:<br>
	Less porosity than coatings prepared by sol-gel methods. The porosity in a sol-gel film is dependent on the interstitial spaces left by the sol particles. However, in our process there is no sol formation, thus the porosity is exclusively controlled by the chemical kinetics of the process itself. Reduced porosity results in higher wear resistance.<br>
	Stronger adhesion of the coating to the substrate since there is a chemical bond instead of the physical interaction resulting from many other processes.<br>
	Favourable temperature and pressure conditions during manufacturing versus other methods such as chemical vapour deposition, sputtering, thermal oxidation, plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition, or flame hydrolysis. Our process is largely carried out at room conditions using simple, economical equipment.<br>
	Flexibility to use a variety of application methods thus making it easier to integrate the coating into existing manufacturing processes.<br>
	Environmentally friendly since the water used in the process can be easily treated, the raw materials have low vapour pressures thus minimizing evaporation losses, and the VOC values are very low.<br>
	Economical raw materials, typically costing US$ 40-50 per litre. Depending on the coating thickness, a litre of our coating covers 4 to 8 square meters. Also, the raw materials are easily available in bulk, at a consistent quality, from a variety of sources. These costs are based on lab development  there should be potential for significant reduction in these costs for manufacturing due to economies of scale.<br>

                            Our technology uses a biopolymer called keratin as a filler to reinforce polymers thereby improving the thermal and structural properties. We have demonstrated our technology in the lab, primarily on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) but also with other polymers. Our technology has the following benefits:<br>
	Keratin is a natural hydrophobic biopolymer (as opposed to cellulose which is hydrophilic) and is thus better suited as a reinforcing agent for those applications where water entering the composite can lead to its degradation. Our experiments indicated that the measured contact angle of water with the keratin biofiber surface is around 90°.<br>
	Keratins well ordered structure gives it high tensile strength even before being added to a composite. Keratin essentially heals itself when subjected to a mechanical load due to structural rearrangements in the molecular chain.<br>
	Keratin biofibers have a high aspect ratio (length / diameter) of approximately 350, supporting effective load transfer from the matrix to the fibre.<br>
	The Youngs modulus of the composite showed significant improvement of around 66% compared to pure cast-prepared PMMA.  Other mechanical characteristics such as such as tensile strength also showed significant improvement.<br>
	A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study showed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased with the biofiber content due to an increase in the rigidity at a molecular level caused by the polypeptide chains joining with the PMMA. For standard PMMA the Tg is 72 °C compared to 109 °C for the 5% biofiber composite.<br>
	A thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the reinforced PMMA showed a decomposition temperature above 300 °C, compared to approximately 175 °C for standard PMMA. This analysis also showed that the 30% weight loss temperature increased from 269 °C for standard PMMA to approximately 330 °C for the 5% biofiber composite.<br>
	Keratins dispersion properties are such that there is no need for chemical compatibilization between the fibres and the PMMA matrix. However, by grafting the polymer onto the keratin we were able to improve the mechanical and thermal behaviour of the resulting composite.<br>
	Keratin fibres are available from renewable sources. Currently, keratin from animal processing is largely viewed as waste. Productively using this waste is both environmentally friendly and a potential source of joint benefit with the animal processing industry.<br>
	There should be minimal changes to current production techniques, involving some functionalization and preparation of both the filler and the matrix. The other materials that our process requires are available in bulk at relatively low prices.<br>
	There are many potential applications for this technology since both mechanical and thermal properties of the polymers were improved.<br>

                            We have developed a coating that can be applied to a variety of substrates (e.g. metal, plastic, rubber) and that allows for easy removal of dried on paint, even if the paint has been baked e.g. in the hot sun. The coating is quite thin (order of 10 micrometers) and durable. The current version is solvent based but we are confident we can create a water based version with minimal development. Our coating is cost effective since we use uses inexpensive components such as commercially available nanoparticles. We have several pictures and movies demonstrating the coating.<br>

                            We have technology for anti-icing coatings for which we are looking for development partners.  An initial version of this coating resulted in a reduction in ice adhesion by a factor of 4 compared to bare aluminum as tested by an independent lab.  We are confident that with further development we could increase the capability of this coating.  The coating has special potential where any reduction in adhesion is helpful and where large areas have to be covered.  Our coating is cost effective since we use uses inexpensive components such as commercially available nanoparticles.<br>

We are looking for partners who can provide technical assistance and/or funding.  The technical assistance we are looking for is a deep understanding of the science of ice - we are coatings experts, not ice experts.  For funding, this could be either potential customers or coating manufacturers.  Our lab rates are very competitive and our business model is to only cover our direct costs for development in exchange for ongoing revenue after commercialization.  This approach significantly lowers the financial risk for a partner.<br>
