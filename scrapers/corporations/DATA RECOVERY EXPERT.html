We called after having a hard drive crash and Oleg looked after us, working endlessly to finish in due time to get our business back up and running. His followup was perfect as well as him help reinstalling when the drive was sent back to us. Start to finish professionalism!!!<br>

Great service and I am very much pleased. I would definitely recommend this company for data recovery. My external hard drive was dead and Mr. Oleg was able to recover 100% of the data.<br>

Excellent service! I was going to buy a new laptop and forget about everything I had on my laptop that had crashed. Luckily I payed less than 1/3 the cost and my computer is like new - all pictures and documents are recovered and my computer is updated and so fast again. Thank you!<br>

I had an external hard drive that was corrupted and some files on there that I needed recovered. Data Recovery &amp; Computer Repair was quick to respond, recover my files and came to my location with the recovered files to check to see if I could access them. Quick, efficient and excellent customer service. I would definitely recommend them.<br>

I was very pleased with the service provided by &quot;Data Recovery Expert&quot;!!! Before reaching this guy I was trying to talk with HP customer service and those guys couldn&#39;t really help me, but they tried!! My notebook was fixed and work without any issues so far. After a few weeks my external hard drive crushed and all my data wasn&#39;t accessible. I&#39;ve bought a recovery software but no luck at all. So I took a chance to contact the same guy and did a magic again, all my files were restored!!! A month later, my custom built tailgate light burned off (LED fused lights) and guess where I went again.... right to the same guy hopping he can fix it as well. And after a week of work, he actually fix it!! So it looks as he can fix any electronic gadget. Maybe next time I will ask him to fix my bike!! :)<br>

I can&#39;t image where I would be right now without these guys help. <br>
<br>
My entire computer got corrupted and I lost all my files, including ALL the baby/child photos of my son. These were the only copies (minus some of Facebook) and I was desperate to get them back. I went enlisted a friend of mine who is a computer genius and he tried to enlist the help of several other companies. However many other people could not recover the files and or were asking an arm and a leg for it, which as a young single mother going to school full time, I couldn&#39;t afford. <br>
<br>
However, when we came to this company they were respectful, understanding, gave amazing customer service and got the job done! Now thanks so this amazing company I have my sons photos and am not destitute lol =) 100% win<br>

Oleg the computer specialist showed up at my door within 15 minutes. He was able to completely strip down and rebuild a crippled laptop within a half hour. Whether it is computer repair or data recovery, this man can do it all. Oleg offers very speedy and friendly service. I definitely recommend this business. <br>

If you require data recovery services I would highly recommend this company. Oleg replied to my email inquiry very quickly. I was able to pick a time for him to come pick up my hard drive from me. At that time he assessed my two damaged hard drives and was able to give an explanation of what could be wrong. He also gave me an estimate on price and told me he would be in contact. While he was recovering my data (later that night!) he sent me updates on what he was doing. All said and done, it took less than half a week for me to get my fixed hard drive back. Not only were his prices extremely reasonable (and cheap comparing to the competition) you will have the peace of mind knowing he really is a data recovery expert and your data is in good hands. Don&#39;t shop around for a better deal -- you&#39;re not going to get one better than this!<br>

Oleg is awesome!!<br>
<br>
I had a partition on HFS Journaled external drive on an iMac and I combined them both together. Well, since I had upgraded to El Capitan, it changed the whole drive over. <br>
<br>
Data lost. <br>
<br>
I bought software off the internet (Stellar) and I got everything back, but it was corrupted. Since this was my only backup drive, I had copied it back onto the backup, coping over my data - Thinking it was good. <br>
<br>
Oleg pulled all my data back (from my two really stupid mistakes) and restored it. All my home movies work, all my photos work, everything is back.<br>
<br>
I thought for sure it was totally gone, but he got everything back. <br>
<br>
If you have a broken, dropped, etc phone, hard drive, laptop, he can work it. It’s amazing what he can pull data off of.<br>
<br>
This is the only company I will go to for data recovery. <br>

Data Recovery Expert and specifically Oleg are doing an outstanding job! I recently had a non-responsive USB flash drive which contained a lot of my last 3-6 months of work (grant applications, presentations, paper manuscripts, reviews; I am with the University of Calgary). I had no recent backup, so I was desperate for data recovery. Found Data Recovery Expert in the Internet and did the drop-off Friday late afternoon. I wasn&#39;t expecting too much, other companies I phoned told me this will take weeks. Oleg contacted me the same day and the next day (Saturday) he brought a new flash drive with the recovered data to my home (!). He was able to recover all except a few files. I was extremely pleased with that, but he wanted to really recover everything. The next day he delivered the fully recovered data on 3 disks, again to my home. And he was much cheaper than competing companies I talked to. To sum up, this was the best service you can imagine. Oleg must be a real genius in recovering data from broken flash drives. He is extremely fast and really wants to give his best: Total consumer satisfaction. Really perfect! I can only highly recommend his company in situations which need data recovery. Five stars plus! <br>

Hope you never need data recovery - but be very very glad that Calgary has Oleg as a recovery expert in case your storage does fail. <br>
Experienced HDD hardware failure for my home desktop. My 4 year old HDD was no longer being recognized and my backup drive apparently wasn&#39;t backing up a single file in the year that I had it. Found Data Recovery Experts online and was also recommended Oleg by word of mouth - realized that this was the same person/company. Oleg responded to my inquiry in a timely manner, was very informative, easy to reach and easy to communicate with (he has no specific office hours). He reviewed the problem, gave a detailed assessment of whether he could retrieve the data, how long it would take and how much it would cost. Don&#39;t let the fact that the company doesn&#39;t have an office throw you off, the savings on rental fees get passed on to costumers and it obviously showed with my quote. Many companies ask for diagnosis fee and will not start work until you agree to terms - Oleg began recovery as soon as he figured out the problem and was able to quickly recover the entire disk completely. It is obvious that he is rightly confident in his abilities and has passion for his work. When you are taking a single shot at recovering personally important data, you would definitely want to choose someone like Oleg over a technician at a day job. Excellent costumer service - he makes pickup and drop off runs and he even helped me put back the fully recovered disk and make sure everything started up alright and set up some settings for disk backup.<br>

I am 67 years old and have had computers for 25 years, I am no slouch when it comes to computers. The biggest mistake I have made in the last 15 years is not regularly backing up my Data. When we have Data loss problems we feel very vulnerable, in today&#39;s age our Data is very valuable to us and we can feel guilt for not regularly backing it up as we know we should have been doing. After my current crash I did the visits to 3 or 4 businesses and was shocked by the exorbitant quotes and total lack of control I would have by just handing over my crashed &#39;Drive&#39; to them. My instincts were screaming, no, no. Then I discovered, via a Goggle search, Data Recovery Expert. The initial contact was through a &#39;answering service&#39; which I hesitated with but was told I could meet the Tech for the drop off. I met Oleg and felt immediately that this was who I wanted to deal with. He is not geeky, has good interpersonal skills and in my experience he was honest and trustworthy. I know many brilliant people who are very talented in the many aspects of computers. Data Recovery is a specialized field that requires specialized equipment, add to that the need for a very trustworthy individual, I believe you get both when you do business with Data Recovery Expert and Oleg. As well he is naturally more than proficient in helping out with all the other problems that computers can present us with. I realize this review might seem a little over the top, it reflects however the depth of gratitude and appreciation I feel for the help I was given during my period of vulnerability and stress when my hard drive crashed. All my Data was not recoverable but what I absolutely needed was fully recovered. My cost was 25% of what the other quotes had been and the work they had described as needed doing was not required at all. Talk about truth in advertising, Oleg is truly an expert.<br>

Highly recommend. Very quick and thorough. I had dropped off the computer to have all of the data backed up after it wouldn&#39;t start (a very old computer, BTW). I was contacted and made aware of the issues immediately, and what options I had if I wanted it repaired. Within a day everything was complete and they even dropped off the computer at my house. Excellent!<br>

Data Recovery did a great job. My hard drive had completely failed, and Data Recovery was able to get my files back for me. Service was good, and the price was good as well. I would recommend this company to anyone who required data recovery. This was not a simple job, as it required rebuilding my hard drive. To have this done locally was another benefit. Thank you very much.<br>

My Macbook crashed and I brought it to the Apple store who told me they couldn&#39;t make the repairs.I called several data recovery services in town on a saturday and Oleg was the only one to return my call. He came to my house and did a free assessment. Told me to leave it with him. Oleg was very friendly and patient in explaining the process to get my pictures and data back. Not only did he retrieve everything onto an external drive for me he repaired my Macbook and its working like new. I had an amazing experience considering the stressful situation. Would highly recommend his services to anyone needing data recovery. <br>

I had a hard drive which ceased working before I had backed up everything including pictures and files - A Big No No! After contacting Oleg he quickly diagnosed the problem as a defective head and gave me a very fair proposal. HIs diagnosis was correct and he was 100 % successful in restoring my data onto another drive for me. Oleg was very informative, prompt and professional in doing so. I hope I won&#39;t have a similar problem again but if I have a friend with a data recovery problem, I will advise them to do business with Oleg. <br>

This company was able to recover our external hard drive with all family pictures we took over 5 years. Before that we tried several other companies in Canada and internationally; they all referred us to the manufacturer. <br>
The service was prompt, all data was recovered. <br>
Thank you!<br>

We called after having a hard drive crash and Oleg looked after us, working endlessly to finish in due time to get our business back up and running. His followup was perfect as well as him help reinstalling when the drive was sent back to us. Start to finish professionalism!!!<br>

Great service and I am very much pleased. I would definitely recommend this company for data recovery. My external hard drive was dead and Mr. Oleg was able to recover 100% of the data.<br>

Excellent service! I was going to buy a new laptop and forget about everything I had on my laptop that had crashed. Luckily I payed less than 1/3 the cost and my computer is like new - all pictures and documents are recovered and my computer is updated and so fast again. Thank you!<br>

I had an external hard drive that was corrupted and some files on there that I needed recovered. Data Recovery &amp; Computer Repair was quick to respond, recover my files and came to my location with the recovered files to check to see if I could access them. Quick, efficient and excellent customer service. I would definitely recommend them.<br>

I was very pleased with the service provided by &quot;Data Recovery Expert&quot;!!! Before reaching this guy I was trying to talk with HP customer service and those guys couldn&#39;t really help me, but they tried!! My notebook was fixed and work without any issues so far. After a few weeks my external hard drive crushed and all my data wasn&#39;t accessible. I&#39;ve bought a recovery software but no luck at all. So I took a chance to contact the same guy and did a magic again, all my files were restored!!! A month later, my custom built tailgate light burned off (LED fused lights) and guess where I went again.... right to the same guy hopping he can fix it as well. And after a week of work, he actually fix it!! So it looks as he can fix any electronic gadget. Maybe next time I will ask him to fix my bike!! :)<br>

I can&#39;t image where I would be right now without these guys help. <br>
<br>
My entire computer got corrupted and I lost all my files, including ALL the baby/child photos of my son. These were the only copies (minus some of Facebook) and I was desperate to get them back. I went enlisted a friend of mine who is a computer genius and he tried to enlist the help of several other companies. However many other people could not recover the files and or were asking an arm and a leg for it, which as a young single mother going to school full time, I couldn&#39;t afford. <br>
<br>
However, when we came to this company they were respectful, understanding, gave amazing customer service and got the job done! Now thanks so this amazing company I have my sons photos and am not destitute lol =) 100% win<br>

Oleg the computer specialist showed up at my door within 15 minutes. He was able to completely strip down and rebuild a crippled laptop within a half hour. Whether it is computer repair or data recovery, this man can do it all. Oleg offers very speedy and friendly service. I definitely recommend this business. <br>

If you require data recovery services I would highly recommend this company. Oleg replied to my email inquiry very quickly. I was able to pick a time for him to come pick up my hard drive from me. At that time he assessed my two damaged hard drives and was able to give an explanation of what could be wrong. He also gave me an estimate on price and told me he would be in contact. While he was recovering my data (later that night!) he sent me updates on what he was doing. All said and done, it took less than half a week for me to get my fixed hard drive back. Not only were his prices extremely reasonable (and cheap comparing to the competition) you will have the peace of mind knowing he really is a data recovery expert and your data is in good hands. Don&#39;t shop around for a better deal -- you&#39;re not going to get one better than this!<br>

Oleg is awesome!!<br>
<br>
I had a partition on HFS Journaled external drive on an iMac and I combined them both together. Well, since I had upgraded to El Capitan, it changed the whole drive over. <br>
<br>
Data lost. <br>
<br>
I bought software off the internet (Stellar) and I got everything back, but it was corrupted. Since this was my only backup drive, I had copied it back onto the backup, coping over my data - Thinking it was good. <br>
<br>
Oleg pulled all my data back (from my two really stupid mistakes) and restored it. All my home movies work, all my photos work, everything is back.<br>
<br>
I thought for sure it was totally gone, but he got everything back. <br>
<br>
If you have a broken, dropped, etc phone, hard drive, laptop, he can work it. It’s amazing what he can pull data off of.<br>
<br>
This is the only company I will go to for data recovery. <br>

Data Recovery Expert and specifically Oleg are doing an outstanding job! I recently had a non-responsive USB flash drive which contained a lot of my last 3-6 months of work (grant applications, presentations, paper manuscripts, reviews; I am with the University of Calgary). I had no recent backup, so I was desperate for data recovery. Found Data Recovery Expert in the Internet and did the drop-off Friday late afternoon. I wasn&#39;t expecting too much, other companies I phoned told me this will take weeks. Oleg contacted me the same day and the next day (Saturday) he brought a new flash drive with the recovered data to my home (!). He was able to recover all except a few files. I was extremely pleased with that, but he wanted to really recover everything. The next day he delivered the fully recovered data on 3 disks, again to my home. And he was much cheaper than competing companies I talked to. To sum up, this was the best service you can imagine. Oleg must be a real genius in recovering data from broken flash drives. He is extremely fast and really wants to give his best: Total consumer satisfaction. Really perfect! I can only highly recommend his company in situations which need data recovery. Five stars plus! <br>

Hope you never need data recovery - but be very very glad that Calgary has Oleg as a recovery expert in case your storage does fail. <br>
Experienced HDD hardware failure for my home desktop. My 4 year old HDD was no longer being recognized and my backup drive apparently wasn&#39;t backing up a single file in the year that I had it. Found Data Recovery Experts online and was also recommended Oleg by word of mouth - realized that this was the same person/company. Oleg responded to my inquiry in a timely manner, was very informative, easy to reach and easy to communicate with (he has no specific office hours). He reviewed the problem, gave a detailed assessment of whether he could retrieve the data, how long it would take and how much it would cost. Don&#39;t let the fact that the company doesn&#39;t have an office throw you off, the savings on rental fees get passed on to costumers and it obviously showed with my quote. Many companies ask for diagnosis fee and will not start work until you agree to terms - Oleg began recovery as soon as he figured out the problem and was able to quickly recover the entire disk completely. It is obvious that he is rightly confident in his abilities and has passion for his work. When you are taking a single shot at recovering personally important data, you would definitely want to choose someone like Oleg over a technician at a day job. Excellent costumer service - he makes pickup and drop off runs and he even helped me put back the fully recovered disk and make sure everything started up alright and set up some settings for disk backup.<br>

I am 67 years old and have had computers for 25 years, I am no slouch when it comes to computers. The biggest mistake I have made in the last 15 years is not regularly backing up my Data. When we have Data loss problems we feel very vulnerable, in today&#39;s age our Data is very valuable to us and we can feel guilt for not regularly backing it up as we know we should have been doing. After my current crash I did the visits to 3 or 4 businesses and was shocked by the exorbitant quotes and total lack of control I would have by just handing over my crashed &#39;Drive&#39; to them. My instincts were screaming, no, no. Then I discovered, via a Goggle search, Data Recovery Expert. The initial contact was through a &#39;answering service&#39; which I hesitated with but was told I could meet the Tech for the drop off. I met Oleg and felt immediately that this was who I wanted to deal with. He is not geeky, has good interpersonal skills and in my experience he was honest and trustworthy. I know many brilliant people who are very talented in the many aspects of computers. Data Recovery is a specialized field that requires specialized equipment, add to that the need for a very trustworthy individual, I believe you get both when you do business with Data Recovery Expert and Oleg. As well he is naturally more than proficient in helping out with all the other problems that computers can present us with. I realize this review might seem a little over the top, it reflects however the depth of gratitude and appreciation I feel for the help I was given during my period of vulnerability and stress when my hard drive crashed. All my Data was not recoverable but what I absolutely needed was fully recovered. My cost was 25% of what the other quotes had been and the work they had described as needed doing was not required at all. Talk about truth in advertising, Oleg is truly an expert.<br>

Highly recommend. Very quick and thorough. I had dropped off the computer to have all of the data backed up after it wouldn&#39;t start (a very old computer, BTW). I was contacted and made aware of the issues immediately, and what options I had if I wanted it repaired. Within a day everything was complete and they even dropped off the computer at my house. Excellent!<br>

Data Recovery did a great job. My hard drive had completely failed, and Data Recovery was able to get my files back for me. Service was good, and the price was good as well. I would recommend this company to anyone who required data recovery. This was not a simple job, as it required rebuilding my hard drive. To have this done locally was another benefit. Thank you very much.<br>

My Macbook crashed and I brought it to the Apple store who told me they couldn&#39;t make the repairs.I called several data recovery services in town on a saturday and Oleg was the only one to return my call. He came to my house and did a free assessment. Told me to leave it with him. Oleg was very friendly and patient in explaining the process to get my pictures and data back. Not only did he retrieve everything onto an external drive for me he repaired my Macbook and its working like new. I had an amazing experience considering the stressful situation. Would highly recommend his services to anyone needing data recovery. <br>

With my work and business files on the line, Oleg provided one of the best customer services I have ever encountered. The business has professional and integrity for client relationship and service. I would highly recommend anyone to seek the service from Data Recovery Expert should they encounter the challenge. As well, the price is reasonable. <br>

I had a hard drive which ceased working before I had backed up everything including pictures and files - A Big No No! After contacting Oleg he quickly diagnosed the problem as a defective head and gave me a very fair proposal. HIs diagnosis was correct and he was 100 % successful in restoring my data onto another drive for me. Oleg was very informative, prompt and professional in doing so. I hope I won&#39;t have a similar problem again but if I have a friend with a data recovery problem, I will advise them to do business with Oleg. <br>

This company was able to recover our external hard drive with all family pictures we took over 5 years. Before that we tried several other companies in Canada and internationally; they all referred us to the manufacturer. <br>
The service was prompt, all data was recovered. <br>
Thank you!<br>
