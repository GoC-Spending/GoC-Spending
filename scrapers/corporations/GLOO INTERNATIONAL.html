                            Gloo International offers fit analysis, data migration, implementation, configuration, customization, training and other related services to complement our systems.  Gloo is unique for our focus on Zoho CRM together with Zoho Campaigns and is one of the few Zoho CRM Certified Consulting partners in the world. Our exclusive focus and deep product knowledge of Zoho applications allows us to implement best practices for you and your team in your CRM and email marketing systems. Our consultants have years of CRM and email marketing experience.<br>
<br>
SERVICES: We offer options to get your team up and running on Zoho applications and ensure you get the most out of your investment.  Our focus is on Zoho CRM and Zoho Campaigns but we are also experienced with many other Zoho applications such as Zoho Mail Suite and Zoho Reports. Choose whether you just want to subscribe to the lower-cost option of video screencasts or engage with us directly or both: watch the video screencasts to set your training foundation then engage with us directly for implementation.<br>
<br>
RESULTS: Ultimately, this all translates into three major benefits for you: (1) more qualified leads; (2) a sales team with more time to sell; (3) reports that tell you what&#39;s actually happening in your business.<br>
