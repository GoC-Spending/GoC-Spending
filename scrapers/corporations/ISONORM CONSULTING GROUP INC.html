<br>
Mandate:<br>
To supply the expertise, the training and the support for the management of the changes required by this project of certification and renovation of several laboratories with a team of five (5) Canadian engineers selected and hired by myself within my own business network for the duration of the project of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).<br>

The CACQE is an important Algerian public institution which is responsible to assure the salubrity (healthiness) of the imported products (foods, cosmetics and other goods) including the control of the drinking water by means of a network of 20 laboratories of physico-chemical and microbiological analysis (4 main regional laboratories of Oran, Algiers, Constantine, Ouargla and 16 secondary laboratories locally).<br>
<br>
ISONORM CONSULTING GROUP INC has accompanied the multiple changes necessary to improve the managerial capacity of the staff, the competence of the employees and the performance of the operational processes including the integration of all the requirements of the following contractual documents into a unique management system applicable to the entire lab network:<br>
<br>
•	Requirements of ISO 17025, ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OSHAS 18001;<br>
•	Relevant Laws and regulations of Algeria;<br>
