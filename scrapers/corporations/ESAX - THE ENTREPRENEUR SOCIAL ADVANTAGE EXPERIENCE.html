              Jarrod Goldsmith has personally helped thousands of entrepreneurial startups with resources, knowledge, networking opportunities and encouragement.<br>
<br>
Both eSAX and Sax Appeal have served to brand Jarrod Goldsmith as a master networker, leader and connector, known to all as a champion of entrepreneurial attitudes, behaviors and activities.<br>
<br>
eSAX is known throughout the Ottawa region as THE networking event to attend for startups, is significant for stimulating regional economic development, and for encouraging people to pursue their dreams of entrepreneurship.<br>
<br>
The long-term plan for eSAX involves the refining of processes so as to allow a national entrepreneurial networking program to provide startups with educational and supportive networks. Having events coincide with each Province’s Self-Employment Benefits Program, as well as involving all regional chambers of commerce, startup incubator communities / programs, all levels of government and post-secondary entrepreneurship facilities will leave a legacy that will continue to benefit both new and established businesses for generations.

It was a very empowering evening and I will definitely recommend it to other entrepreneurs” Crystal OConnell. Web Designer at Creative Integration Web Design<br>
