              PowerTerm has proved to be the ultimate software connectivity solution for access to information residing on host systems. <br>
<br>
Developed in 1994, PowerTerm has been a major success in the global access market and it currently holds over 15% of the host access market across 45 countries worldwide. <br>
<br>
Unlike other terminal emulators that consume 30-100MB of hard disk space, PowerTerm provides full functionality while only occupying 5MB of hard disk space. <br>
<br>
PowerTerm offers simple and fast installation as well as an effective means of working with legacy applications running under Windows platforms on a variety of hosts such as IBM AS/400, IBM Mainframe, Digital and Unix, Hp and Tandem. <br>
<br>

              &quot;Best Emulator around and believe me I have tried about 24 emulators from commercial to shareware.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What can I say? It is the best emulator I have worked with and I have used many.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I love your product, and have been recommending it widely&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;PowerTerm is a very good product!!! I also use Rumba but your product is a lot better&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Of all of the packages that I have tried (including Crosstalk by Attachmate, Procomm Plus, HyperAccess by Hilgraeve, ZOC, rat, PowerVT, Anzio, CRT and about 10 others) PowerTerm is the easiest to set up and use. It also offers the most flexibility for terminal types (comparable to TinyTerm and SmartTerm which are much higher priced).&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;m just sending this email to let you guys know that you have put out a very quality product, PowerTerm Interconnect. It is the first program that has the speed and versatility of a Unix program in a more user friendly format. This is one great tool, keep up the good work. Hey, this may be one of the few products I actually register. Good job!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;This VT terminal emulator is excellent.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;First let me tell ya that I think PowerTerm is a GREAT program, One of the best that I&#39;ve seen. Makes me feel like I&#39;m sitting in front of my console, when I&#39;m telneting in.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I downloaded your software from Tucows and it is the only net client for Windows 3.1 that works properly with AOL&#39;s winsock. I would like to register and get your product for my computer so that I can successfully do my homework from home.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We are running a demo copy and have been delighted with access to IBM Mainframe, IBM AIX and IBM AS400.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;All we need is basic VT220/320 - Telnet emulation with good scroll back and good 132 column support. PowerTerm is better than Reflections.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We saw PowerTerm as a very attractive product with its simplicity in operation and installation, yet providing full functionality for host-PC connectivity implemented in a very efficient manner in terms of memory usage and CPU usage during run time, and the disk space required. It was thought Power Power can expect cost savings due to the reduced administration cost and support. Of many outstanding features of PowerTerm, we liked the Power Pad for easy access to key board keys or macros, and Double-click on a word issuing the word as a command to the host.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;After evaluating PowerTerm, Cityweb, Germany&#39;s largest regional online service, has found it to be an outstanding terminal emulator and we have decided to include it on our special CD offering to our subscribers to ease their usage of the connectivity possibilities we provide.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ll be purchasing a registered version of PowerTerm because it does a great job. I&#39;ve had it for three days and I love it!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are software and ISP developers. We have been evaluating the software for a few weeks now, and we have found it to be the best terminal software that we have seen.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve just downloaded your product and love it. I&#39;ve been looking for a stable emulator to use for telneting into my development platform and this one is the best I&#39;ve found yet.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used your evaluation copy of Powerterm and I am very, very pleased. Performance is noticeably greater than anything else I&#39;ve tried, and the SCO ANSI emulation is flawless. In addition, the large selection of emulation types is quite impressive.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Congratulations for a fine product !!! PowerTerm is really a job well done !!! We have downloaded PowerTerm for Windows 95 and were really impressed by the product. We have used it to connect a PC to a SCO Server.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is an absolutely amazing app that covers every emulation need I can imagine for all of my customers. I support many UNIX sites and this product fits for everyone. The SCO ANSI emulation is 100% perfect without reprogramming and keys or changing and termcap info. This is not usual and I have worked with more than 50 different emulators over the years.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to take a moment to compliment the excellent support response I have gotten so far from Ericom. Brian and Pat have been extremely helpful and responsive. The amount of time it took to get a patch implemented (3 business days) was fantastic. With most companies, I would be lucky to get an Email acknowledgment of the problem, let alone a fix, in that short of a time period.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I liked your PowerTerm terminal emulator. I downloaded it from your Web site in under 5 minutes. It was easy to install and set up. I liked the &quot;Save Session&quot; option and dialing was a snap. PowerTerm allowed me to work from home for the first time. Everybody wants to work in their boxer shorts, you guys make it happen.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I did download the program as I was using this to access my office system (DIGITAL UNIX V 3.2) It gives me a perfect emulation especially when I am using move back command on man command. I have noticed most of the terminal emulation programs fail to refresh the screen properly.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We have had phenomenal success with our rollout!!! The Help Desk (with respect) to calls on PowerTerm has been like the proverbial &quot;Maytag Repairman&quot;. We are getting many requests for PowerTerm as word of mouth seems to be working against our &quot;controlled demo&quot;. In other words the natives are restless. You REALLY do have a superb product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I ordered PowerTerm 320 this morning - a great product. I&#39;ve used several emulation products and this has the most features for the price. A much better value than WRQ Reflection.&quot; <br>
&quot;GREAT PRODUCT! I have had it for 2 days and am ready to order 6 copies for eval. Site license may follow!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;After using PowerTerm for the past week, we do like it and are currently ordering 5 copies. It&#39;s great to be able to get on the Net and find software that you need without having to research different vendors without a clue as to what software currently exists. Thanks for the Demo copy!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are a professional web site developer company running several Unix (SCO and SUN) servers in our web farm. We have tried your product and are very pleased with the functionality.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The PowerTerm Wyse 60 emulation is better than a true Wyse 60. Switching between 132 and 80 column mode does not erase the other screens in multiscreen mode like a Wyse 60 does. The cut and paste between screens for small blocks of data is very convenient. The Wyse 60 on my desk went down, and was sent in for repair. The repaired Wyse 60 is still in its box, because I don&#39;t want it taking up any of my desk space. PowerTerm is simply a terrific product!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a developer. ... I also do freelance work out of my home office. The copy of PowerTerm is for my use in my office at home. I love its TelNet connectivity, and the &#39;built-in&#39; ftp module ... superb! I have already begun to tout its features to some coworkers.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is the only program that I have tried that works with NT 4.0 smoothly. I know the program is capable of doing much more than what I need it for, but one never knows what tomorrow&#39;s requirements are.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have been very pleased with the performance of your product. It is the only product I have found that works without problems under NT 3.51.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used your product for a few weeks (I looked for any good telnet program for Windows NT in the Internet and I have found PowerTerm). The PowerTerm Program works very well. I liked it because I could have the same settings every time I opened the same connection to any site. The easy way to change the size of the fonts was also very good. I could see more lines in the same space on the screen. Simultaneous change of size of the window and size of the fonts - that is why I liked it very much.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I like Powerterm, we need TN3270 emulation to talk to our USA mainframe and Powerterm works well for that.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;A great Product! I&#39;m a user of Extra Attachment for Windows NT. I had just upgraded my workstation from NT 4 beta to NT 4 final. Extra failed to launch Dr. Watson. I desperately needed a 3270 emulation program. Found your site - downloaded the software - Instant success!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I purchased your &#39;PowerTerm 32&#39;, and I enjoy it so much! I use it for my job, and it&#39;s really useful.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The colors look FANTASTIC&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I tried PowerTerm with our AS/400 over TN5250 and it is really fast!!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This package seems to be the best telnet 5250 emulator I have seen.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;m testing for my company the POWERTERM software with AS/400. Congratulations, it&#39;s a nice product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve downloaded PowerTerm and I&#39;ve tested it with our AS/400 through Internet and it was fantastic (really!).&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I just downloaded your demo version of PowerTerm. I used it to access an IBM AS/400 via TELNET with 5250 emulation and like it a lot.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are a developer. We sell Retail Operations software. All of our clients have an AS/400, Windows NT or UNIX host at their home office and PCs in their stores. We have never recommended a TELNET program to them. After looking at your PowerTerm, I would gladly recommend it to our customers.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to inform you that your AS/400 5250 emulation is working like a charm. Works better, in my opinion, than Client Access.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am using your TN5250 emulator for evaluation and my initial impression is that it is the best emulator I have seen so far. I have used IBM Client/Access, Chameleon and Ewan but your product is in my opinion the better one.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve been using an eval copy of Powerterm for about three weeks now, and am quite pleased with it. Most of my use of it has been to dial in to my employer&#39;s AS/400.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are using the program as a 5250 emulator over TCP/IP from our Hong Kong operation back to our AS/400 systems in NY. The great thing about your program was ease of installation and use.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used your PowerTerm software to connect to AS400 via TCP/IP protocol using NT RAS server and on top of that running PowerTerm to connect to AS400 which is also running a TCP stack. It worked GREAT so congrats for the great product. Since that day I have mentioned about this product to at least a dozen people and most of them are IBM vars and Engineers, they all wanted to know more so I gave your WWW address, I hope they will spread the word too.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all, I have to say you have a first-rate product. I especially like the ease with which the user can store and make selections of connection sites. Something I think is a particularly nice intervention is the use of a dialog box for System Request functions, instead of leaving them down on the bottom line as the 5250 does. I don&#39;t know if anyone has mentioned it to you, but depending on color combinations and the positioning of the panel(s) you have open, the traditional line can be nearly impossible to see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I appreciate the ease with which one can open multiple screens. With some other terminal emulators I&#39;ve used, each panel has to be separately configured and cataloged -- nice work, folks. <br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, as I say, PowerTerm is so far the best package I&#39;ve tried for connections via the Internet.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;After trying the Powerterm Demo version I am very impressed. I have used many emulators over the years but this is by far the best product I have ever seen. I can not imagine what else could be added.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;PowerTerm is a very slick product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve been very impressed by PowerTerm. It is actually faster than the console attached to our Data General AViiON! &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I must take this opportunity to let you know how happy I am with PowerTerm, having tried 5 other terminal emulators, 3 of which I had to pay full price for first and no refund even though unusable. I find the SCO-ANSI emulation the most suitable for my Unix applications, and unlike other emulators PowerTerm displays the colors etc correctly, I also found it easy to set up with the function keys and home, end, etc. working well. Thanks for your service and a good product which I needed.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The truth is that I needed a good terminal emulator. Searching the web took a lot of time and your program is the best there is . Thank you for creating the perfect solution for my needs.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Your product is one of the most kick ass telnet clients I&#39;ve seen. I work at a network integration company that works mainly with AIX your product is 10 times better than our current offering.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am currently using the evaluation copy of PowerTerm, and I think it&#39;s great ...&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We liked it so much we bought 100 copies!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This is just to let you know that I bought 10 licenses of PowerTerm Inter-Connect and that it is a very good product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The wonderful thing about your product is the ability to perform Zmodem/Kermit within a Telnet session. Also, my customer support people say the product automatically switches between 80 and 132 column in the term window. &quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I recently received my developer&#39;s version in the mail and I just wanted to say thanks! Well done.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Make no mistake about it, your software is awesome, and I am working to get the appropriate number of copies to serve our needs. If I told you what it was for, you would be surprised. It allowed us to let emergency management see what is going on, so they KNOW the numbers and kinds of alarms dealt with daily, routinely by a dispatcher on a fire control system using SCO-UNIX.&quot;

              PowerTerm has proved to be the ultimate software connectivity solution for access to information residing on host systems. <br>
<br>
Developed in 1994, PowerTerm has been a major success in the global access market and it currently holds over 15% of the host access market across 45 countries worldwide. <br>
<br>
Unlike other terminal emulators that consume 30-100MB of hard disk space, PowerTerm provides full functionality while only occupying 5MB of hard disk space. <br>
<br>
PowerTerm offers simple and fast installation as well as an effective means of working with legacy applications running under Windows platforms on a variety of hosts such as IBM AS/400, IBM Mainframe, Digital and Unix, Hp and Tandem. <br>
<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;Best Emulator around and believe me I have tried about 24 emulators from commercial to shareware.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What can I say? It is the best emulator I have worked with and I have used many.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I love your product, and have been recommending it widely&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;PowerTerm is a very good product!!! I also use Rumba but your product is a lot better&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Of all of the packages that I have tried (including Crosstalk by Attachmate, Procomm Plus, HyperAccess by Hilgraeve, ZOC, rat, PowerVT, Anzio, CRT and about 10 others) PowerTerm is the easiest to set up and use. It also offers the most flexibility for terminal types (comparable to TinyTerm and SmartTerm which are much higher priced).&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;m just sending this email to let you guys know that you have put out a very quality product, PowerTerm Interconnect. It is the first program that has the speed and versatility of a Unix program in a more user friendly format. This is one great tool, keep up the good work. Hey, this may be one of the few products I actually register. Good job!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;This VT terminal emulator is excellent.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;First let me tell ya that I think PowerTerm is a GREAT program, One of the best that I&#39;ve seen. Makes me feel like I&#39;m sitting in front of my console, when I&#39;m telneting in.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I downloaded your software from Tucows and it is the only net client for Windows 3.1 that works properly with AOL&#39;s winsock. I would like to register and get your product for my computer so that I can successfully do my homework from home.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We are running a demo copy and have been delighted with access to IBM Mainframe, IBM AIX and IBM AS400.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;All we need is basic VT220/320 - Telnet emulation with good scroll back and good 132 column support. PowerTerm is better than Reflections.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We saw PowerTerm as a very attractive product with its simplicity in operation and installation, yet providing full functionality for host-PC connectivity implemented in a very efficient manner in terms of memory usage and CPU usage during run time, and the disk space required. It was thought Power Power can expect cost savings due to the reduced administration cost and support. Of many outstanding features of PowerTerm, we liked the Power Pad for easy access to key board keys or macros, and Double-click on a word issuing the word as a command to the host.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;After evaluating PowerTerm, Cityweb, Germany&#39;s largest regional online service, has found it to be an outstanding terminal emulator and we have decided to include it on our special CD offering to our subscribers to ease their usage of the connectivity possibilities we provide.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ll be purchasing a registered version of PowerTerm because it does a great job. I&#39;ve had it for three days and I love it!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are software and ISP developers. We have been evaluating the software for a few weeks now, and we have found it to be the best terminal software that we have seen.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve just downloaded your product and love it. I&#39;ve been looking for a stable emulator to use for telneting into my development platform and this one is the best I&#39;ve found yet.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used your evaluation copy of Powerterm and I am very, very pleased. Performance is noticeably greater than anything else I&#39;ve tried, and the SCO ANSI emulation is flawless. In addition, the large selection of emulation types is quite impressive.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Congratulations for a fine product !!! PowerTerm is really a job well done !!! We have downloaded PowerTerm for Windows 95 and were really impressed by the product. We have used it to connect a PC to a SCO Server.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is an absolutely amazing app that covers every emulation need I can imagine for all of my customers. I support many UNIX sites and this product fits for everyone. The SCO ANSI emulation is 100% perfect without reprogramming and keys or changing and termcap info. This is not usual and I have worked with more than 50 different emulators over the years.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to take a moment to compliment the excellent support response I have gotten so far from Ericom. Brian and Pat have been extremely helpful and responsive. The amount of time it took to get a patch implemented (3 business days) was fantastic. With most companies, I would be lucky to get an Email acknowledgment of the problem, let alone a fix, in that short of a time period.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I liked your PowerTerm terminal emulator. I downloaded it from your Web site in under 5 minutes. It was easy to install and set up. I liked the &quot;Save Session&quot; option and dialing was a snap. PowerTerm allowed me to work from home for the first time. Everybody wants to work in their boxer shorts, you guys make it happen.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I did download the program as I was using this to access my office system (DIGITAL UNIX V 3.2) It gives me a perfect emulation especially when I am using move back command on man command. I have noticed most of the terminal emulation programs fail to refresh the screen properly.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We have had phenomenal success with our rollout!!! The Help Desk (with respect) to calls on PowerTerm has been like the proverbial &quot;Maytag Repairman&quot;. We are getting many requests for PowerTerm as word of mouth seems to be working against our &quot;controlled demo&quot;. In other words the natives are restless. You REALLY do have a superb product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I ordered PowerTerm 320 this morning - a great product. I&#39;ve used several emulation products and this has the most features for the price. A much better value than WRQ Reflection.&quot; <br>
&quot;GREAT PRODUCT! I have had it for 2 days and am ready to order 6 copies for eval. Site license may follow!&quot; <br>
<br>

&quot;After using PowerTerm for the past week, we do like it and are currently ordering 5 copies. It&#39;s great to be able to get on the Net and find software that you need without having to research different vendors without a clue as to what software currently exists. Thanks for the Demo copy!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are a professional web site developer company running several Unix (SCO and SUN) servers in our web farm. We have tried your product and are very pleased with the functionality.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The PowerTerm Wyse 60 emulation is better than a true Wyse 60. Switching between 132 and 80 column mode does not erase the other screens in multiscreen mode like a Wyse 60 does. The cut and paste between screens for small blocks of data is very convenient. The Wyse 60 on my desk went down, and was sent in for repair. The repaired Wyse 60 is still in its box, because I don&#39;t want it taking up any of my desk space. PowerTerm is simply a terrific product!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a developer. ... I also do freelance work out of my home office. The copy of PowerTerm is for my use in my office at home. I love its TelNet connectivity, and the &#39;built-in&#39; ftp module ... superb! I have already begun to tout its features to some coworkers.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is the only program that I have tried that works with NT 4.0 smoothly. I know the program is capable of doing much more than what I need it for, but one never knows what tomorrow&#39;s requirements are.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have been very pleased with the performance of your product. It is the only product I have found that works without problems under NT 3.51.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used your product for a few weeks (I looked for any good telnet program for Windows NT in the Internet and I have found PowerTerm). The PowerTerm Program works very well. I liked it because I could have the same settings every time I opened the same connection to any site. The easy way to change the size of the fonts was also very good. I could see more lines in the same space on the screen. Simultaneous change of size of the window and size of the fonts - that is why I liked it very much.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I like Powerterm, we need TN3270 emulation to talk to our USA mainframe and Powerterm works well for that.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;A great Product! I&#39;m a user of Extra Attachment for Windows NT. I had just upgraded my workstation from NT 4 beta to NT 4 final. Extra failed to launch Dr. Watson. I desperately needed a 3270 emulation program. Found your site - downloaded the software - Instant success!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I purchased your &#39;PowerTerm 32&#39;, and I enjoy it so much! I use it for my job, and it&#39;s really useful.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The colors look FANTASTIC&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I tried PowerTerm with our AS/400 over TN5250 and it is really fast!!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This package seems to be the best telnet 5250 emulator I have seen.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;m testing for my company the POWERTERM software with AS/400. Congratulations, it&#39;s a nice product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve downloaded PowerTerm and I&#39;ve tested it with our AS/400 through Internet and it was fantastic (really!).&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I just downloaded your demo version of PowerTerm. I used it to access an IBM AS/400 via TELNET with 5250 emulation and like it a lot.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are a developer. We sell Retail Operations software. All of our clients have an AS/400, Windows NT or UNIX host at their home office and PCs in their stores. We have never recommended a TELNET program to them. After looking at your PowerTerm, I would gladly recommend it to our customers.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to inform you that your AS/400 5250 emulation is working like a charm. Works better, in my opinion, than Client Access.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am using your TN5250 emulator for evaluation and my initial impression is that it is the best emulator I have seen so far. I have used IBM Client/Access, Chameleon and Ewan but your product is in my opinion the better one.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve been using an eval copy of Powerterm for about three weeks now, and am quite pleased with it. Most of my use of it has been to dial in to my employer&#39;s AS/400.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are using the program as a 5250 emulator over TCP/IP from our Hong Kong operation back to our AS/400 systems in NY. The great thing about your program was ease of installation and use.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used your PowerTerm software to connect to AS400 via TCP/IP protocol using NT RAS server and on top of that running PowerTerm to connect to AS400 which is also running a TCP stack. It worked GREAT so congrats for the great product. Since that day I have mentioned about this product to at least a dozen people and most of them are IBM vars and Engineers, they all wanted to know more so I gave your WWW address, I hope they will spread the word too.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all, I have to say you have a first-rate product. I especially like the ease with which the user can store and make selections of connection sites. Something I think is a particularly nice intervention is the use of a dialog box for System Request functions, instead of leaving them down on the bottom line as the 5250 does. I don&#39;t know if anyone has mentioned it to you, but depending on color combinations and the positioning of the panel(s) you have open, the traditional line can be nearly impossible to see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I appreciate the ease with which one can open multiple screens. With some other terminal emulators I&#39;ve used, each panel has to be separately configured and cataloged -- nice work, folks. <br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, as I say, PowerTerm is so far the best package I&#39;ve tried for connections via the Internet.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;After trying the Powerterm Demo version I am very impressed. I have used many emulators over the years but this is by far the best product I have ever seen. I can not imagine what else could be added.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;PowerTerm is a very slick product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve been very impressed by PowerTerm. It is actually faster than the console attached to our Data General AViiON! &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I must take this opportunity to let you know how happy I am with PowerTerm, having tried 5 other terminal emulators, 3 of which I had to pay full price for first and no refund even though unusable. I find the SCO-ANSI emulation the most suitable for my Unix applications, and unlike other emulators PowerTerm displays the colors etc correctly, I also found it easy to set up with the function keys and home, end, etc. working well. Thanks for your service and a good product which I needed.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The truth is that I needed a good terminal emulator. Searching the web took a lot of time and your program is the best there is . Thank you for creating the perfect solution for my needs.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Your product is one of the most kick ass telnet clients I&#39;ve seen. I work at a network integration company that works mainly with AIX your product is 10 times better than our current offering.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am currently using the evaluation copy of PowerTerm, and I think it&#39;s great ...&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We liked it so much we bought 100 copies!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This is just to let you know that I bought 10 licenses of PowerTerm Inter-Connect and that it is a very good product.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The wonderful thing about your product is the ability to perform Zmodem/Kermit within a Telnet session. Also, my customer support people say the product automatically switches between 80 and 132 column in the term window. &quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I recently received my developer&#39;s version in the mail and I just wanted to say thanks! Well done.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Make no mistake about it, your software is awesome, and I am working to get the appropriate number of copies to serve our needs. If I told you what it was for, you would be surprised. It allowed us to let emergency management see what is going on, so they KNOW the numbers and kinds of alarms dealt with daily, routinely by a dispatcher on a fire control system using SCO-UNIX.&quot;
