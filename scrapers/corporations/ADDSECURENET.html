                            ADDSecure.Net Audit is an ADDSecure.Net Inc. security<br>
 auditing service to probe integrity of Web sites and network<br>
 servers. The service is being offered world-wide to<br>
 corporations, government agencies and financial institutions <br>
that<br>
 must maintain sensitive data on their Web sites. ADDSecure.Net<br>
 Inc. also actively encourages Internet service providers, web<br>
 developers, accounting, insurance brokerage and computer<br>
 security firms to participate in reselling this new service. <br>
<br>
 ADDSecure.Net Audit encompasses a range of Internet<br>
 network and server audit and testing services.  The program is<br>
 powerful enough to satisfy the strenuous demands of leading<br>
 government organizations, banks and private corporations, yet it<br>
 can meet the budget requirements of even small firms. The most<br>
 basic audit service consists of a series of remote tests <br>
conducted<br>
 by our team of dedicated network security  professionals.  The<br>
 tests result in an in-depth and easy to read confidential report<br>
 detailing security vulnerabilities uncovered within the network. <br>
 Comprehensive tests are conducted using powerful Internet<br>
 auditing tools developed by ADDSecure.Net Inc., as well as<br>
 with commercial probes optimized for the operational<br>
 environment used by service clients. <br>
<br>
 US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#39;s (FDIC) guidance<br>
 FIL-68-99 of July 7, 1999 &quot;Risk Assessment Tools and<br>
 Practices for Information System Security&quot; recommends regular<br>
 use of vulnerability assessment tools and penetration analyses <br>
as<br>
 an integral component of an institution&#39;s information security<br>
 program. The analysis should be independent and may be<br>
 conducted by a trusted third party, qualified internal audit <br>
team,<br>
 or a combination of both. If using internal testers, the<br>
 independence of the testers from system administrators should be<br>
 considered. ADDSecure.Net Audit addresses the key<br>
 requirements of this document. <br>
<br>
 We are not that concerned with the brand name of equipment<br>
 your organization uses to secure your network or server, as long<br>
 as it does a proper job -- and probably neither should you.   We<br>
 help you to assure security of your network as much as possible,<br>
 by leveraging already installed equipment and by using inhouse<br>
 technical and security personnel. An independent audit can help<br>
 you protect the integrity of your network and, in the process,<br>
 save money by decreasing unnecessary or ineffective Internet<br>
 security measures. <br>
<br>
 A single vulnerability check of up to 8 (eight) I.P. addresses,<br>
 whether they are located on the same or different servers, costs<br>
 just US$5,500. Electronic submission of a scan request using an<br>
 online Order Form reduces the price to $5,000 -- a 10%<br>
 discount. To maintain the security of a network over the longer<br>
 run, an annual set of tests for multiple sites can be purchased <br>
in<br>
 packages at significant savings. <br>
<br>
 This simple but powerful audit service has been developed in<br>
 response to requests from numerous ADDSecure.Net Inc.<br>
 clients.  With the increased vulnerability of global computer<br>
 networks and the raising competitive pressure to provide<br>
 services through the Internet, public agencies and private<br>
 corporations need to ensure that the integrity of their data and<br>
 that of their own customers is well preserved. <br>
<br>
 Many executives do not fully realize how much data within their<br>
 area of responsibility are accessible by penetrating the <br>
corporate<br>
 Web. Well-publicized cases of altering government homepages<br>
 (i.e., see http:// www.ADDSecure.net/breach.htm) prove that no<br>
 one is immune from hackers located far away or within the<br>
 organization.  Just as with financial audits, you cannot rely<br>
 entirely on the tests done by the vendors of security solutions,<br>
 and you do need to see results of security audits conducted by<br>
 independent professionals. <br>
<br>
 Some of our clients have already found the hard way that hiring<br>
 real hackers to check corporate defences might be imprudent at<br>
 the best.  What they are looking for is an independent and <br>
ethical<br>
 audit team that has the persistence and adroitness of hackers <br>
but<br>
 that also possesses the professionalism and undisputed integrity<br>
 of industry security leaders.  ADDSecure.Net Audit service<br>
 has been built around this growing demand and provides our<br>
 world-wide clients with badly needed security audit solutions. <br>

                            appSQA Source Code Audit, a service offered by<br>
 ADDSecure.Net Inc., provides program testing and code<br>
 inspection of Internet applications to uncover security and <br>
quality<br>
 assurance flaws. This original service is being offered<br>
 worldwide to developers, system integraters and users of<br>
 mission- critical Internet, intranet and Extranet applications. <br>
To<br>
 corporations that are concerned with the security of their <br>
online<br>
 services, appSQA provides the best line of defense when<br>
 implementing ecommerce, Internet banking and transactional<br>
 delivery of administrative services. <br>
<br>
 The appSQA service includes program security testing and a<br>
 thorough review of programming source code for Internet/ Web<br>
 applications written in programming languages such as Perl, C,<br>
 C++, Visual Basic or Java. Taking into account the known<br>
 security risks for a particular platform and the latest security<br>
 patches, our professional code auditors implement a series of<br>
 tests on the program to locate any security weakness or breach <br>
of<br>
 corporate security policy within the application. <br>
<br>
 The auditors perform a line-by-line inspection of the<br>
 programming source code to identify new problems relating to<br>
 security. In addition, they look for any malicious code that<br>
 employs helper programs on a user&#39;s hard disk to access<br>
 unauthorized files and deliver them to the application&#39;s author. <br>
<br>
 Once the testing and code inspection phases are completed, the<br>
 auditors generate a comprehensive, easy-to-read report detailing<br>
 the code deficiencies uncovered in the analysis. If warranted,<br>
 some suggestions on the ways to remedy the problems might be<br>
 included in the report. <br>
<br>
 The appSQA service only checks for flaws in programming<br>
 which may lead to security breaches. It does not involve any<br>
 quality assurance testing for program functionality or<br>
 presentation. In other words, we will only test your program to<br>
 see if it violates system integrity, not to see if it performs<br>
 correctly. <br>
<br>
 This powerful audit service has been developed in response to<br>
 numerous requests from ADDSecure.Net Inc. clients. There is a<br>
 growing concern for web transaction security, particularly in <br>
light<br>
 of numerous security breaches that occur even to high-profile<br>
 industry, banking, military and government Web sites (e.g., see<br>
 http://www.ADDSecure.net/breach.htm). With the increased<br>
 sophistication of hackers and the proliferation of intrusion<br>
 attempts on a global scale, along with the rising competitive<br>
 pressure to provide interactive services through the Internet,<br>
 public agencies and private corporations need to ensure that the<br>
 integrity of their data, and that of their customer&#39;s, is well<br>
 preserved. <br>
<br>
 The price of appSQA service depends on many factors, such as<br>
 the operating system used, the complexity of programming<br>
 language, the programming culture and QA control of the<br>
 development team. The exact price for the appSQA project can<br>
 only be obtained if at least a 300-line sample code has been<br>
 submitted to ADDSecure.Net. But generally our charge for such<br>
 work starts from US$5 per line of code. A minimal charge might<br>
 apply. <br>

                            SNAPShot is a &quot;minimum hassle&quot; US$1650 (US$1500 if<br>
 ordered online) Security Review that reports whether the<br>
 network is vulnerable to the prevailing types of threats. This<br>
 simple but powerful service has been developed in response to<br>
 numerous requests from our clients and could become an integral<br>
 part of their ongoing corporate Quality Assurance process. It is<br>
 being offered world-wide to corporations, government agencies<br>
 and financial institutions that must maintain sensitive data on<br>
 their Web sites. <br>
<br>
 Whether you are a Bank President, wishing to assure yourself<br>
 that your organization&#39;s environment is secure, a CIO after<br>
 having had implemented a new network configuration, a CFO<br>
 ensuring that due diligence has been exercised and hence<br>
 corporate liability is minimized, or a Webmaster after making<br>
 changes to your site -- SNAPShot Security review provides an<br>
 excellent low cost alternative to frequent audits, to assure<br>
 ongoing &quot;peace of mind&quot;. <br>
<br>
 Network and Web site security auditing is only as good as its<br>
 most recent vulnerability test. Hence we made SNAPShot a<br>
 completely automated service that can only be activated by<br>
 client&#39;s request submitted through Internet -- upon verification <br>
of<br>
 registration, payment and the authenticity of the client&#39;s <br>
identity<br>
 -- and as often as the client wishes. As a result of the <br>
security<br>
 review, clients get clear evidence whether their networks are<br>
 vulnerable to external intrusion. <br>
<br>
 SNAPShot encompasses a well-focused set of Internet security<br>
 tests that concentrate on the most frequent vulnerabilities<br>
 typically exploited by hackers. The tests include: <br>
<br>
     Probing of all tcp/udp/icmp ports for active services; <br>
     Verification of Domain Registration Records; <br>
     Domain Name Service (DNS) security test; <br>
     Fully Qualified Domain Name (forward and reverse)<br>
     validation; <br>
<br>
 Vulnerability exposure tests are conducted using powerful<br>
 Internet auditing tools developed by ADDSecure.Net Inc., as<br>
 well as with commercial probes optimized for the operational<br>
 environment used by service clients. <br>
<br>
 Knowing that many leading media services currently lack<br>
 adequate Internet defences, and are high profile targets to<br>
 hackers, ADDSecure.Net Inc. has announced a special free offer<br>
 (valid until September 1, 1998, certain restrictions might <br>
apply)<br>
 to test Web sites that belong to newspapers, magazines,<br>
 television and other mass communication enterprises and that are<br>
 actively used for information dissemination through Internet.<br>
 Each participating media outlet will be entitled to a free<br>
 SNAPShot QA Audit, providing it fill the SNAPShot Order<br>
 Form (see http://www.ADDSecure.net/cgi-bin/order.pl, and<br>
 identify itself as a member of the media in the window<br>
 &quot;Questions/Other relevant information&quot;. <br>
<br>
 Many executives do not fully realize how much data within their<br>
 area of responsibility are accessible by penetrating the <br>
corporate<br>
 Web. Well-publicized cases of altering government homepages<br>
 (i.e., see http://www.ADDSecure.net/breach.htm) prove that no<br>
 one is immune from hackers located far away or within the<br>
 organization.  Just as with financial audits, you cannot rely<br>
 entirely on the tests done by the vendors of security solutions,<br>
 and you do need to see results of security reviews and audits<br>
 conducted by independent professionals. <br>
<br>
 Some of our clients have already found the hard way that hiring<br>
 real hackers to check corporate defences might be imprudent at<br>
 the best.  What they are looking for is an independent and <br>
ethical<br>
 audit team that has the persistence and adroitness of hackers <br>
but<br>
 that also possesses the professionalism and undisputed integrity<br>
 of industry security leaders.  SNAPShot services have been<br>
 built around this growing demand and provide our world-wide<br>
 clients with badly needed vulnerability exposure service. <br>

                            ADDSecure.Net Audit is an ADDSecure.Net Inc. security<br>
 auditing service to probe integrity of Web sites and network<br>
 servers. The service is being offered world-wide to<br>
 corporations, government agencies and financial institutions <br>
that<br>
 must maintain sensitive data on their Web sites. ADDSecure.Net<br>
 Inc. also actively encourages Internet service providers, web<br>
 developers, accounting, insurance brokerage and computer<br>
 security firms to participate in reselling this new service. <br>
<br>
 ADDSecure.Net Audit encompasses a range of Internet<br>
 network and server audit and testing services.  The program is<br>
 powerful enough to satisfy the strenuous demands of leading<br>
 government organizations, banks and private corporations, yet it<br>
 can meet the budget requirements of even small firms. The most<br>
 basic audit service consists of a series of remote tests <br>
conducted<br>
 by our team of dedicated network security  professionals.  The<br>
 tests result in an in-depth and easy to read confidential report<br>
 detailing security vulnerabilities uncovered within the network. <br>
 Comprehensive tests are conducted using powerful Internet<br>
 auditing tools developed by ADDSecure.Net Inc., as well as<br>
 with commercial probes optimized for the operational<br>
 environment used by service clients. <br>
<br>
 US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#39;s (FDIC) guidance<br>
 FIL-68-99 of July 7, 1999 &quot;Risk Assessment Tools and<br>
 Practices for Information System Security&quot; recommends regular<br>
 use of vulnerability assessment tools and penetration analyses <br>
as<br>
 an integral component of an institution&#39;s information security<br>
 program. The analysis should be independent and may be<br>
 conducted by a trusted third party, qualified internal audit <br>
team,<br>
 or a combination of both. If using internal testers, the<br>
 independence of the testers from system administrators should be<br>
 considered. ADDSecure.Net Audit addresses the key<br>
 requirements of this document. <br>
<br>
 We are not that concerned with the brand name of equipment<br>
 your organization uses to secure your network or server, as long<br>
 as it does a proper job -- and probably neither should you.   We<br>
 help you to assure security of your network as much as possible,<br>
 by leveraging already installed equipment and by using inhouse<br>
 technical and security personnel. An independent audit can help<br>
 you protect the integrity of your network and, in the process,<br>
 save money by decreasing unnecessary or ineffective Internet<br>
 security measures. <br>
<br>
 A single vulnerability check of up to 8 (eight) I.P. addresses,<br>
 whether they are located on the same or different servers, costs<br>
 just US$5,500. Electronic submission of a scan request using an<br>
 online Order Form reduces the price to $5,000 -- a 10%<br>
 discount. To maintain the security of a network over the longer<br>
 run, an annual set of tests for multiple sites can be purchased <br>
in<br>
 packages at significant savings. <br>
<br>
 This simple but powerful audit service has been developed in<br>
 response to requests from numerous ADDSecure.Net Inc.<br>
 clients.  With the increased vulnerability of global computer<br>
 networks and the raising competitive pressure to provide<br>
 services through the Internet, public agencies and private<br>
 corporations need to ensure that the integrity of their data and<br>
 that of their own customers is well preserved. <br>
<br>
 Many executives do not fully realize how much data within their<br>
 area of responsibility are accessible by penetrating the <br>
corporate<br>
 Web. Well-publicized cases of altering government homepages<br>
 (i.e., see http:// www.ADDSecure.net/breach.htm) prove that no<br>
 one is immune from hackers located far away or within the<br>
 organization.  Just as with financial audits, you cannot rely<br>
 entirely on the tests done by the vendors of security solutions,<br>
 and you do need to see results of security audits conducted by<br>
 independent professionals. <br>
<br>
 Some of our clients have already found the hard way that hiring<br>
 real hackers to check corporate defences might be imprudent at<br>
 the best.  What they are looking for is an independent and <br>
ethical<br>
 audit team that has the persistence and adroitness of hackers <br>
but<br>
 that also possesses the professionalism and undisputed integrity<br>
 of industry security leaders.  ADDSecure.Net Audit service<br>
 has been built around this growing demand and provides our<br>
 world-wide clients with badly needed security audit solutions. <br>

                            appSQA Source Code Audit, a service offered by<br>
 ADDSecure.Net Inc., provides program testing and code<br>
 inspection of Internet applications to uncover security and <br>
quality<br>
 assurance flaws. This original service is being offered<br>
 worldwide to developers, system integraters and users of<br>
 mission- critical Internet, intranet and Extranet applications. <br>
To<br>
 corporations that are concerned with the security of their <br>
online<br>
 services, appSQA provides the best line of defense when<br>
 implementing ecommerce, Internet banking and transactional<br>
 delivery of administrative services. <br>
<br>
 The appSQA service includes program security testing and a<br>
 thorough review of programming source code for Internet/ Web<br>
 applications written in programming languages such as Perl, C,<br>
 C++, Visual Basic or Java. Taking into account the known<br>
 security risks for a particular platform and the latest security<br>
 patches, our professional code auditors implement a series of<br>
 tests on the program to locate any security weakness or breach <br>
of<br>
 corporate security policy within the application. <br>
<br>
 The auditors perform a line-by-line inspection of the<br>
 programming source code to identify new problems relating to<br>
 security. In addition, they look for any malicious code that<br>
 employs helper programs on a user&#39;s hard disk to access<br>
 unauthorized files and deliver them to the application&#39;s author. <br>
<br>
 Once the testing and code inspection phases are completed, the<br>
 auditors generate a comprehensive, easy-to-read report detailing<br>
 the code deficiencies uncovered in the analysis. If warranted,<br>
 some suggestions on the ways to remedy the problems might be<br>
 included in the report. <br>
<br>
 The appSQA service only checks for flaws in programming<br>
 which may lead to security breaches. It does not involve any<br>
 quality assurance testing for program functionality or<br>
 presentation. In other words, we will only test your program to<br>
 see if it violates system integrity, not to see if it performs<br>
 correctly. <br>
<br>
 This powerful audit service has been developed in response to<br>
 numerous requests from ADDSecure.Net Inc. clients. There is a<br>
 growing concern for web transaction security, particularly in <br>
light<br>
 of numerous security breaches that occur even to high-profile<br>
 industry, banking, military and government Web sites (e.g., see<br>
 http://www.ADDSecure.net/breach.htm). With the increased<br>
 sophistication of hackers and the proliferation of intrusion<br>
 attempts on a global scale, along with the rising competitive<br>
 pressure to provide interactive services through the Internet,<br>
 public agencies and private corporations need to ensure that the<br>
 integrity of their data, and that of their customer&#39;s, is well<br>
 preserved. <br>
<br>
 The price of appSQA service depends on many factors, such as<br>
 the operating system used, the complexity of programming<br>
 language, the programming culture and QA control of the<br>
 development team. The exact price for the appSQA project can<br>
 only be obtained if at least a 300-line sample code has been<br>
 submitted to ADDSecure.Net. But generally our charge for such<br>
 work starts from US$5 per line of code. A minimal charge might<br>
 apply. <br>

                            SNAPShot is a &quot;minimum hassle&quot; US$1650 (US$1500 if<br>
 ordered online) Security Review that reports whether the<br>
 network is vulnerable to the prevailing types of threats. This<br>
 simple but powerful service has been developed in response to<br>
 numerous requests from our clients and could become an integral<br>
 part of their ongoing corporate Quality Assurance process. It is<br>
 being offered world-wide to corporations, government agencies<br>
 and financial institutions that must maintain sensitive data on<br>
 their Web sites. <br>
<br>
 Whether you are a Bank President, wishing to assure yourself<br>
 that your organization&#39;s environment is secure, a CIO after<br>
 having had implemented a new network configuration, a CFO<br>
 ensuring that due diligence has been exercised and hence<br>
 corporate liability is minimized, or a Webmaster after making<br>
 changes to your site -- SNAPShot Security review provides an<br>
 excellent low cost alternative to frequent audits, to assure<br>
 ongoing &quot;peace of mind&quot;. <br>
<br>
 Network and Web site security auditing is only as good as its<br>
 most recent vulnerability test. Hence we made SNAPShot a<br>
 completely automated service that can only be activated by<br>
 client&#39;s request submitted through Internet -- upon verification <br>
of<br>
 registration, payment and the authenticity of the client&#39;s <br>
identity<br>
 -- and as often as the client wishes. As a result of the <br>
security<br>
 review, clients get clear evidence whether their networks are<br>
 vulnerable to external intrusion. <br>
<br>
 SNAPShot encompasses a well-focused set of Internet security<br>
 tests that concentrate on the most frequent vulnerabilities<br>
 typically exploited by hackers. The tests include: <br>
<br>
     Probing of all tcp/udp/icmp ports for active services; <br>
     Verification of Domain Registration Records; <br>
     Domain Name Service (DNS) security test; <br>
     Fully Qualified Domain Name (forward and reverse)<br>
     validation; <br>
<br>
 Vulnerability exposure tests are conducted using powerful<br>
 Internet auditing tools developed by ADDSecure.Net Inc., as<br>
 well as with commercial probes optimized for the operational<br>
 environment used by service clients. <br>
<br>
 Knowing that many leading media services currently lack<br>
 adequate Internet defences, and are high profile targets to<br>
 hackers, ADDSecure.Net Inc. has announced a special free offer<br>
 (valid until September 1, 1998, certain restrictions might <br>
apply)<br>
 to test Web sites that belong to newspapers, magazines,<br>
 television and other mass communication enterprises and that are<br>
 actively used for information dissemination through Internet.<br>
 Each participating media outlet will be entitled to a free<br>
 SNAPShot QA Audit, providing it fill the SNAPShot Order<br>
 Form (see http://www.ADDSecure.net/cgi-bin/order.pl, and<br>
 identify itself as a member of the media in the window<br>
