                            Customized team building is ideal for a management team or work group that<br>
<br>
1. Is newly formed (or re-formed)<br>
2. Has a brand new leader<br>
3. Has been experiencing conflict or a decrease in effectiveness<br>
4. Just wants to become even more effective<br>
<br>
Fulcrum will design and facilitate a session for your group to address specific team challenges and opportunities. Typically our clients call on us to help a team increase its capacity to achieve results by developing elements such as:<br>
<br>
 Team mission and vision<br>
 Key performance benchmarks<br>
 Clear roles and responsibilities among members<br>
 Agreed-upon behavior guidelines<br>
 Productive work processes and decision-making procedures<br>
 Alignment with the direction and priorities of the wider organization<br>
 Group cohesion and motivation<br>
<br>
Issues around leadership, communications or trust may also need to be addressed, as appropriate. Our facilitator first meets with the manager or team leader to scope the teams history, current challenges and the outcomes desired from team building.<br>
<br>
On occasion, we may recommend that group members complete a team assessment questionnaire in advance. When the issues are particularly sensitive and relations within the team are tense, we will opt to conduct one-on-one diagnostic interviews with each team member.<br>
<br>
Based on input we gather from the leader and the team (and, occasionally, from others not in the team), we customize a 1-2 day team building retreat that will focus laser like on the teams highest indicated priorities. Further team building may, in some cases, be required but only if the team elects to engage in it.<br>

                            Does your department or unit periodically go off-site together for a day or so to build group cohesion, address specific challenges or opportunities, learn some new skills and perhaps in the process have some fun?<br>
<br>
Fulcrum will customize and facilitate a session for your group to make your day away both productive and memorable. Depending upon your goals for the event, we have the resources to help your group<br>
<br>
 Have a high energy, engaging group experience with some fundamental learning embedded in<br>
 Learn specific skills (e.g. communications, teamwork, responding to change, dealing with conflict)<br>
 Learn one anothers personality style and how to work productively with the differences<br>
 Reduce silo mentality<br>
 Improve the way sub-units interact, collaborate and hand off work product<br>
 Craft a shared mission, vision, and values<br>
 Identify concrete ways to enhance relationships with other departments, customers, stakeholders, etc.<br>
 Build group cohesion and team spirit<br>
 Celebrate a successful and/or challenging year<br>
<br>
We meet with you in advance to identify what you want your participants to know and be able to do, as well as how you want them to feel at the end of the session.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what outcomes you decide on, our twin goals will be to:<br>
<br>
1. Enhance the capacity of your unit to deliver the results you expect from it<br>
2. Provide you with a solid return on your investment in the event<br>

                            In high performing organizations these days, matrix teams, project teams and task forces are commonplace.<br>
<br>
These groups have high demands placed on them to produce results-quickly! For this reason, in these limited life teams there is an almost overwhelming tendency to dive right into the work of the team on Day 1 without paying any heed to the human dynamics of the group. This focusing on what team members must deliver without planning for how they will work together usually comes back later to reduce the groups capacity to meet its deliverables and deadlines.<br>
<br>
Frequently assembled from different parts of the organization, members of these teams bring different perspectives, assumptions, needs and ways of working. They must, however, sort out their human dynamics early on and get everyone aligned with and committed to the teams objectives.<br>
<br>
We will fast-track your limited life team to high performance by spending just one day-at the front end-helping sort out its human dynamics and processes so that it can then turn its attention productively to the job at-hand.<br>
<br>
Your group will address fundamentals critical to the teams success:<br>
<br>
 Team purpose<br>
 Operating guidelines<br>
 Deliverables<br>
 Expectations of members<br>
 Skills, knowledge, experience each member brings<br>
 Commitment to team success<br>
 Relations with the &quot;champion(s)&quot; to whom it reports<br>
 What to do when we get &quot;stuck&quot;<br>
<br>
Your team members will leave this session with a sense of cohesion, confidence, enthusiasm, and focus, as well as an appreciation for the soft skills that will drive their hard results.<br>

                            As a manager, you have undoubtedly at some time asked yourself<br>
<br>
How can I ensure that both I and my team are focusing our efforts on activities that will yield maximum results and best move this unit toward its objectives?<br>
<br>
Fulcrums KRA (Key Result Areas) Process is a proven way to get everyone in your unit aligned with your priorities and focused on the high leverage tasks.<br>
<br>
You and each of your team members will achieve clarity around three essential aspects of your respective jobs:<br>
<br>
1. The overall purpose of your job (in just a sentence or two)<br>
2. The key areas of your job where you are expected to generate results<br>
3. How you currently spend your time vs. how, ideally, you should be deploying yourself, given your KRAs.<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: As an added benefit, your team members will learn that the choices they make daily (even hourly) about how they deploy themselves constitute a business investment decision!<br>
<br>
The KRA process begins with each participant doing some pre-work analysis. This is followed by a facilitated session with you and your team to gain agreement on the above three elements.<br>
<br>
The length of the session depends upon how many are in your team. You can expect to spend about one day for a group of 6-7 individuals. For a larger department or organization, typically the top management team goes through the process first. The managers then usually have enough understanding to roll out the process to the rest of the staff.<br>
<br>
Outcomes you can expect:<br>
<br>
 Clear agreement between you and each team member around what his or her deliverables are<br>
 A document for you to individually coach them and address any performance shortfalls<br>
 A document they can use to better manage their time and priorities<br>
 Increased productivity from each team member<br>
 Input for a pay-for-performance system<br>
<br>
Its a crazy work world out there<br>
<br>
As a manager, you face shifting demands from your staff as well as from above. You cope with frequent interruptions and distractions. You are inundated with electronic messages and information. And there is always too little time to do what feels like an adequate job.<br>
<br>
Add to this the fact that you are human! We humans face the ever-present temptation to spend our time and attention on the tasks that we do the best and like the most. We often creatively avoid the more challenging and complex parts of our job. The problem is that these usually involve the tasks that generate the greatest results.<br>
<br>
Sometimes we need a bit of structure and clarity to keep us focused. Through the KRA process you will achieve that clarityand then watch your teams capacity to deliver soar.<br>

                            This cutting edge methodology brings together the wisdom and experience of your people and releases their energy and creativity to solve a problem or uncover an opportunity.<br>
<br>
The Open Space approach works wonders when your organization<br>
<br>
 Has a major, complex issue to tackle (e.g. Becoming more customer-focused, Getting to market faster, Implementing a major change)<br>
 Must move forward quickly to take practical action on it<br>
 Needs to draw from the perspectives of, and get buy-in from, a diverse group of people<br>
 Has, or anticipates having, conflict on its hands around the issue<br>
 Is genuinely open to empowering its people, utilizing their input and trusting that they will deliver solid, practical ideas and courses of action<br>
 Will commit to act upon the ideas generated and utilize the enthusiasm and commitment generated amongst the participants to make results happen<br>
<br>
THE PROCESS begins with your organization defining the issue, creating the theme, setting any budget limitations or other boundaries and inviting the participants. Then at the event, once our facilitator has set the scene and explained the essentially self-regulating process, your group is unleashed to discuss and tackle aspects of the issue that they feel strongly about. Open Space runs on two fundamentals: passion and responsibility. Passion engages the participants and responsibility ensures that the deliverables occur.<br>
<br>
TYPICAL OUTPUTS from an Open Space meeting, in the form of a written report generated by the end of the session, can include ideas, insights, related issues consolidated, priorities identified, proposals, initial action plans laid out, and enthusiastic task groups created from amongst the participants.<br>
<br>
The event can last anywhere from 1 day (raise and discuss key issues only) to 2 1/2 days (generate a set of proceedings that includes prioritized issues, recommended initiatives and names of participants committed to implementing the various action plans back at work.) The Open Space methodology works well with groups of from 10 to 1000 participants. There simply is no more efficient way to bring a wide group of people together to address a complex issue and converge on focused action.<br>

                            What Participants Will Learn<br>
<br>
 Communicating your performance expectations unambiguously<br>
 How to get the employee in touch with what motivates him/her at work<br>
 Leading the performance discussion in a non-directive way<br>
 Keeping the conversation on an &quot;adult-to-adult&quot; level<br>
 How to position responsibility with the underperforming individual<br>
 Recognizing good performance<br>
 Four effective assertive verbal approaches<br>
<br>
Overview<br>
<br>
Questions often asked about performance:<br>
<br>
 &quot;I have an employee whose performance has been continuously and irritatingly marginal? What can I do to get him/her to do a fully satisfactory job? When should I give up?&quot;<br>
 &quot;What factors might motivate different people to do the job we are paying them for? How can I, their manager, tap into that motivation?&quot;<br>
 &quot;How can I give corrective feedback to employees so that I get my message across clearly and, at the same time, maintain their self-respect?&quot;<br>
 &quot;When I have to confront an employee about his/her poor performance, how do I deal with side-tracks, victim mentality and counterattacks?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Where does coaching fit in to all this?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dealing with a poor performer is the single toughest task that your managers are required to do. They don&#39;t really teach this skill at either MBA school or the &quot;school of hard knocks.&quot; Furthermore, most managers do not understand human motivation (beyond money) and how they can leverage an employee&#39;s particular skills and motivators to generate solid performance.<br>
<br>
Not comfortable engaging in these tough conversations, many managers avoid the poor performance issue altogether or, alternatively, come at it like a steamroller-threaten, shame, or manipulate the staffer to do better. What usually results is resistance, no change in behavior, lingering resentment on the part of both parties, and lower morale in the work group.<br>
<br>
In this one-day, technique-packed workshop, learn how to conduct those difficult performance-correcting discussions with your employees in a non-acrimonious, problem-solving atmosphere. As a result, You will reduce your stress and position the responsibility for current performance and improvement-where it belongs-on the shoulders of the employee.<br>
<br>
It is possible, with your influence, to turn around many employees who up-to-now have been taking up altogether too much of your time and energy. Learn how.<br>
<br>

                            Management Development for a Competitive Edge<br>
For Engaged Employees<br>
In todays complex, volatile world, every organization seeks a sustainable edge. Companies struggle to create a marked advantage over their market rivals. Non-profit and public organizations seek to exceed their stakeholders ever-increasing expectations.<br>
<br>
A growing body of research reveals that the surest route to a sustainable edge is a workforce of highly engaged employees.These are individuals willing to contribute discretionary effort and creativitychoosing to go above and beyond expectationsto further their organizations success.<br>
<br>
However, resent studies by Towers Perrin and Blessing-White found that only 3 out of 10 North American workers are fully engaged. Even more distressing, close to 20% are actively disengaged! These latter are typically the ones who spread contagious negativity.<br>
<br>
How do you create a culture of high engagement in your organization?<br>
<br>
How do you turn around your less engaged employees and remove this drag on maximizing results?<br>
<br>
Outstanding leadership at the top is certainly a key part of the answerbut it is not enough! Your top team may be the most visionary, strategic, forward thinking, inspiring group around, but without strong leadership at all levels of your management team you cant foster highly engaged employees or the positive impact they will have on your enterprises capacity.<br>
<br>
Your managers are the missing link.<br>
This is where The Skillful Leader comes in.<br>
<br>
Its your mid-level management team that turns the vision and goals into action and results. They are the ones who directly motivate and engage your employees.<br>
<br>
We have designed The Skillful Leader to help them do exactly that.<br>
<br>
This program covers the range of managerial skills that are essential for fostering an engaged workforce. Blending interpersonal effectiveness with a strong orientation toward business results, these competency areas include self-awareness, interacting with others, leading staff, and focusing everyone on achieving maximum performance.<br>
<br>
10 things The Skillful Leader will teach your managers to do:<br>
<br>
1. Increase their leadership effectiveness, generating greater results.<br>
2. Manage themselves and their time in order to accomplish business priorities.<br>
3. Identify and leverage their own unique leadership strengths and style.<br>
4. Inspire their people to action through the power of shared vision.<br>
5. Align the actions of their people with their organizations strategy.<br>
6. Build a culture of employee engagement, personal accountability, ongoing innovation, and high productivity.<br>
7. Know when and how to delegate in a way that ensures quality results while developing the employee.<br>
8. Develop their direct reports to their potential.<br>
9. Conduct honest performance management conversations that motivate, rather than demoralize, their people.<br>
10. Engage effectively with a wider variety of personality types.<br>
<br>
The Process<br>
The Skillful Leader development process combines (1) group learning, (2) individualized coaching and (3) post-program reinforcement. Together, these elements promote lasting behavior change.<br>
<br>
Group Learning<br>
Our six-day classroom training is divided into three 2-day segments, scheduled three to six weeks apart. This phasing of sessions allows participants to implement and practice back on the job a few new behaviors at a time. Each workshop employs a rich variety of learning techniques, including:<br>
<br>
 Theory/concept presentations<br>
 Stories and examples<br>
 Hands-on skill practice<br>
 Skill demonstration by the presenter<br>
 Coaching in class<br>
 Videos demonstrating how to do (or not to do) certain skills<br>
 Small group discussions<br>
 Individual reflection<br>
 Problem-solving on real situations from participants workplace<br>
 Role-playing<br>
 Simulations<br>
 Concrete action planning for back at work<br>
<br>
Individual Coaching<br>
Every participant receives a one-hour coaching session with one of our facilitators after each two-day segment (a total of three hours of coaching). We help them understand any material on which they are not clear. We both challenge and encourage them to try out and practice newly learned behaviors. And we support them around any skills which they find particularly difficult to apply<br>
<br>
Post-Program Support<br>
Following the six-day program, we reinforce behavior change in several ways:<br>
 For a full year your participating managers receive a monthly e-mail that highlights a key lesson from the curriculum and introduces new ideas and tips not presented in class.<br>
 We conduct a debrief with your executive team to share our observations about the group and discuss ways in which you can support the transformation from new skills to permanent behavior.<br>
 For six months after the last classroom day participants are welcome to contact any of the presenters with questions or issues relating to managing their people.<br>

                            Executive Leadership Development for a Competitive Edge &amp; Strategic Advantage<br>
<br>
Most organizations want to be among the best in their industry or their field. They want to win in the marketplace or excel as a public or non-profit enterprise.<br>
<br>
How does your enterprise become the front-runner and maintain that position?<br>
<br>
You may try investing in any number of elements you hope will give you a strategic advantage, such as<br>
<br>
 The latest technology<br>
 A better supply chain<br>
 Process improvements<br>
 New products or services<br>
 Outsourcing non-core functions<br>
<br>
But the reality is that your competitors can do the same thing! Increasingly, strategic factors such as these are merely the price of admission to the game. They cant differentiate you for any length of time.<br>
<br>
The best guarantee of an enduring edge is a group of employees who are engaged, enthusiastic, and committed to the organizations mission and goals.<br>
<br>
Great Leadership<br>
So, what does it take to create that kind of workforce?<br>
<br>
Great leadership that starts at the top and permeates every layer of your organization.<br>
<br>
Having good enough leaders at the top is, simply, not good enough<br>
<br>
If you want to maximize your organizations capacity to deliver you need great leaders at the top. In fact, a recent study on leadership by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman found that the top 10% of leaders created double the net income generated by leaders in the next 80%.<br>
<br>
The Authentic Leader* equips your executives to increase their impact on your organizations capacity.<br>
<br>
Our four-step process carefully integrates peer feedback, one-on-one coaching and a powerful experiential workshop to help your leadership team members adopt the mindset that research has identified in extraordinary leaders. The process challenges your leaders to make a significant shift<br>
<br>
From:<br>
 Being cautious and playing not to lose<br>
 Controlling and dictating<br>
 Criticizing others or remaining detached<br>
 Going along to be liked<br>
<br>
To:<br>
 Achieving results and playing to win<br>
 Bringing out the best in others<br>
 Productively engaging with people<br>
 Being courageously authentic<br>

                            What Participants Will Learn<br>
<br>
 How to build your relationship with your manager<br>
 Understanding your managers style, pressures, goals, priorities and preferred way of interacting<br>
 Personal success requires an accountability (vs. blaming) mindset<br>
 How to exhibit leadership from your level<br>
 Determining what you really want from your work (i.e. your current motivators)<br>
 How to express your ideas and needs clearly and assertively<br>
 Soliciting feedback to increase your effectiveness, credibility and career potential<br>
 How to manage your own job performance and work objectives<br>
 How to be a partner in the Performance Management Process<br>
<br>
Overview<br>
<br>
NOTE: In our leadership training we show how to shift accountability to your employee for meeting job performance standards and the completing tasks satisfactorily and on-time.<br>
<br>
Managers in these courses have often said to us, You are teaching us how to hold our employees accountable for their performance. If only our employees would step forward and accept that personal accountability. Do you have a workshop for them?<br>
<br>
Managing Up is exactly the course managers have been asking for!<br>
<br>
It mirrors, for your staff, the flip side of what we teach your managers. Here we train employees how to take on accountability for their own job performance and career development.<br>
<br>
This workshop challenges your individual contributors: If they want to get ahead or even just have a good experience in their current jobthey must start treating their boss and others in management as their customers.<br>
<br>
We show your employees how this calls for a shift in their mindset. We discuss the courage it takes to make and keep commitments and to speak their mind. Participants are given ample opportunity for reflection to identify:<br>
<br>
 What their responsibility is for their job satisfaction and performance<br>
 Their managers situationwhat they imagine he or she is facing<br>
 What they want from their job and to what extent they are still getting it<br>
 What they think their current brand image is in the organization<br>
 One current work goal and how they can progress to achieving it<br>
<br>
Points Regarding This Program<br>
<br>
 Target audience is primarily non-supervisory staff and individual contributors. It is also very suitable, by the way, for supervisors and managers in their other roleas employees.<br>
 A great training strategy is to first put your managers through our The Skillful Leader and then cycle your entire staff through Managing Up.<br>
 This course has plenty of participant involvement, including small group discussions, personal reflection and application activities.<br>
 We have integrated two excellent videos into the program: &quot;Courageous Followers, Courageous Leaders&quot; and &quot;Accountability that Works.&quot;<br>

                            What is Leadership Coaching?<br>
<br>
Leadership Coaching is a series of periodic one-on-one consultations, in person or by phone, between a manager and his or her coach. The coaching process typically lasts anywhere from three to seven months but, depending upon the complexity of the issues, may continue several months longer. Generallybut not alwaysit begins with administration of a 360º feedback assessment prior to concentrated work with the coach.<br>
<br>
You should look at coaching as a focused, scalpel strategy for the leadership development of an individual manager. For coaching to succeed, there must be two commitments established up-front:<br>
<br>
1. By the individual manager to work hard to achieve the agreed-upon outcomes.<br>
2. By the organization, particularly the managers immediate boss, to support his or her efforts in every way possible.<br>
<br>
Coaching begins by clarifying among the manager (i.e. the client), his/her immediate boss, and the coach the agreed upon measurable or observable outcomes of the process. Frequently a representative of Human Resources is also involved.<br>
<br>
Between coaching sessions the manager applies newly learned approaches, skills, and behavior at work, observes the impact, and then with the aid of the coach refines his/her approach accordingly.<br>
<br>
What are the benefits of coaching?<br>
<br>
 The manager zeroes in on the specific skills and behaviors that are essential to his/her ability to perform.<br>
 Desired behavior change takes place quickly due to immediate, real time application of learning back on the job.<br>
 The manager begins to demonstrate improved results very soon.<br>
 Greater productivity, higher morale, and lower turnover among the managers staff, due to his/her improved effectiveness as a leader and communicator.<br>
<br>
Where can Leadership Coaching really make a difference?<br>
1. When performance as a leader is not meeting expectations.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;A key individual at a relatively senior level in your organization has reached a critical juncture. On one hand, his strong technical knowledge and experience means he has a lot to contribute. On the other hand, his interpersonal style is seriously limiting his ability to work effectively with others. Despite discussions you have had with him, he doesnt seem to know how to make the needed changes. You dont want to let him go but the negative impact of his style is now outweighing the positive elements he contributes to the organization.<br>
<br>
2. Developing skills for growth in current and future positions.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
A strong performer was recently promoted, transferred or hired into a new challenging leadership role, one that is stretching her talents.&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;Or, perhaps you have an identified high potential employee who has been in her current role for a while and it is now time to prepare her for advancement to a more complex leadership role.<br>
<br>
3. Senior leader seeks a trusted advisor.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
A leader has few, if any, people with whom he can talk candidly about the challenges he faces. Rather than needing regular, focused coaching conversations, what he wants is to be able to contact a coach/advisor on an ad hoc basis whenever he confronts a demanding situation or has an issue he wants to kick around and get advice on.<br>
What needs to be in place for your investment in coaching to pay off?<br>
Five Questions to ask before investing in coaching:<br>
<br>
1. Will the identified changes result in significantly better performance results?<br>
2. Is customized development required (vs. sending him/her on a skills training seminar)?<br>
3. Are the development issues sufficiently complex to call for focused guidance over a period of time<br>
4. Is the individual genuinely willing (i.e. without feeling coerced) to be coached?<br>
5. Are there circumstances involved that call for a private approach, sensitivity, and confidentiality?<br>
<br>
What process for Leadership Coaching do you use at Fulcrum?<br>
<br>
To quote management expert Peter Block, We are born on the wrong side of our eyes. Our approach is to enable the client to see his or her own behavior, from outside himself/herself. We work not just at the skill and behavior level. We also bring into the process the clients assumptions, attitudes, habits of thought, and values which combine to significantly drive his/her behavior.<br>
<br>
Our instruments of choice are The Leadership Circle Profile and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®.<br>

                            Customized team building is ideal for a management team or work group that<br>
<br>
1. Is newly formed (or re-formed)<br>
2. Has a brand new leader<br>
3. Has been experiencing conflict or a decrease in effectiveness<br>
4. Just wants to become even more effective<br>
<br>
Fulcrum will design and facilitate a session for your group to address specific team challenges and opportunities. Typically our clients call on us to help a team increase its capacity to achieve results by developing elements such as:<br>
<br>
 Team mission and vision<br>
 Key performance benchmarks<br>
 Clear roles and responsibilities among members<br>
 Agreed-upon behavior guidelines<br>
 Productive work processes and decision-making procedures<br>
 Alignment with the direction and priorities of the wider organization<br>
 Group cohesion and motivation<br>
<br>
Issues around leadership, communications or trust may also need to be addressed, as appropriate. Our facilitator first meets with the manager or team leader to scope the teams history, current challenges and the outcomes desired from team building.<br>
<br>
On occasion, we may recommend that group members complete a team assessment questionnaire in advance. When the issues are particularly sensitive and relations within the team are tense, we will opt to conduct one-on-one diagnostic interviews with each team member.<br>
<br>
Based on input we gather from the leader and the team (and, occasionally, from others not in the team), we customize a 1-2 day team building retreat that will focus laser like on the teams highest indicated priorities. Further team building may, in some cases, be required but only if the team elects to engage in it.<br>

                            Does your department or unit periodically go off-site together for a day or so to build group cohesion, address specific challenges or opportunities, learn some new skills and perhaps in the process have some fun?<br>
<br>
Fulcrum will customize and facilitate a session for your group to make your day away both productive and memorable. Depending upon your goals for the event, we have the resources to help your group<br>
<br>
 Have a high energy, engaging group experience with some fundamental learning embedded in<br>
 Learn specific skills (e.g. communications, teamwork, responding to change, dealing with conflict)<br>
 Learn one anothers personality style and how to work productively with the differences<br>
 Reduce silo mentality<br>
 Improve the way sub-units interact, collaborate and hand off work product<br>
 Craft a shared mission, vision, and values<br>
 Identify concrete ways to enhance relationships with other departments, customers, stakeholders, etc.<br>
 Build group cohesion and team spirit<br>
 Celebrate a successful and/or challenging year<br>
<br>
We meet with you in advance to identify what you want your participants to know and be able to do, as well as how you want them to feel at the end of the session.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what outcomes you decide on, our twin goals will be to:<br>
<br>
1. Enhance the capacity of your unit to deliver the results you expect from it<br>
2. Provide you with a solid return on your investment in the event<br>

                            In high performing organizations these days, matrix teams, project teams and task forces are commonplace.<br>
<br>
These groups have high demands placed on them to produce results-quickly! For this reason, in these limited life teams there is an almost overwhelming tendency to dive right into the work of the team on Day 1 without paying any heed to the human dynamics of the group. This focusing on what team members must deliver without planning for how they will work together usually comes back later to reduce the groups capacity to meet its deliverables and deadlines.<br>
<br>
Frequently assembled from different parts of the organization, members of these teams bring different perspectives, assumptions, needs and ways of working. They must, however, sort out their human dynamics early on and get everyone aligned with and committed to the teams objectives.<br>
<br>
We will fast-track your limited life team to high performance by spending just one day-at the front end-helping sort out its human dynamics and processes so that it can then turn its attention productively to the job at-hand.<br>
<br>
Your group will address fundamentals critical to the teams success:<br>
<br>
 Team purpose<br>
 Operating guidelines<br>
 Deliverables<br>
 Expectations of members<br>
 Skills, knowledge, experience each member brings<br>
 Commitment to team success<br>
 Relations with the &quot;champion(s)&quot; to whom it reports<br>
 What to do when we get &quot;stuck&quot;<br>
<br>
Your team members will leave this session with a sense of cohesion, confidence, enthusiasm, and focus, as well as an appreciation for the soft skills that will drive their hard results.<br>

                            As a manager, you have undoubtedly at some time asked yourself<br>
<br>
How can I ensure that both I and my team are focusing our efforts on activities that will yield maximum results and best move this unit toward its objectives?<br>
<br>
Fulcrums KRA (Key Result Areas) Process is a proven way to get everyone in your unit aligned with your priorities and focused on the high leverage tasks.<br>
<br>
You and each of your team members will achieve clarity around three essential aspects of your respective jobs:<br>
<br>
1. The overall purpose of your job (in just a sentence or two)<br>
2. The key areas of your job where you are expected to generate results<br>
3. How you currently spend your time vs. how, ideally, you should be deploying yourself, given your KRAs.<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: As an added benefit, your team members will learn that the choices they make daily (even hourly) about how they deploy themselves constitute a business investment decision!<br>
<br>
The KRA process begins with each participant doing some pre-work analysis. This is followed by a facilitated session with you and your team to gain agreement on the above three elements.<br>
<br>
The length of the session depends upon how many are in your team. You can expect to spend about one day for a group of 6-7 individuals. For a larger department or organization, typically the top management team goes through the process first. The managers then usually have enough understanding to roll out the process to the rest of the staff.<br>
<br>
Outcomes you can expect:<br>
<br>
 Clear agreement between you and each team member around what his or her deliverables are<br>
 A document for you to individually coach them and address any performance shortfalls<br>
 A document they can use to better manage their time and priorities<br>
 Increased productivity from each team member<br>
 Input for a pay-for-performance system<br>
<br>
Its a crazy work world out there<br>
<br>
As a manager, you face shifting demands from your staff as well as from above. You cope with frequent interruptions and distractions. You are inundated with electronic messages and information. And there is always too little time to do what feels like an adequate job.<br>
<br>
Add to this the fact that you are human! We humans face the ever-present temptation to spend our time and attention on the tasks that we do the best and like the most. We often creatively avoid the more challenging and complex parts of our job. The problem is that these usually involve the tasks that generate the greatest results.<br>
<br>
Sometimes we need a bit of structure and clarity to keep us focused. Through the KRA process you will achieve that clarityand then watch your teams capacity to deliver soar.<br>

                            This cutting edge methodology brings together the wisdom and experience of your people and releases their energy and creativity to solve a problem or uncover an opportunity.<br>
<br>
The Open Space approach works wonders when your organization<br>
<br>
 Has a major, complex issue to tackle (e.g. Becoming more customer-focused, Getting to market faster, Implementing a major change)<br>
 Must move forward quickly to take practical action on it<br>
 Needs to draw from the perspectives of, and get buy-in from, a diverse group of people<br>
 Has, or anticipates having, conflict on its hands around the issue<br>
 Is genuinely open to empowering its people, utilizing their input and trusting that they will deliver solid, practical ideas and courses of action<br>
 Will commit to act upon the ideas generated and utilize the enthusiasm and commitment generated amongst the participants to make results happen<br>
<br>
THE PROCESS begins with your organization defining the issue, creating the theme, setting any budget limitations or other boundaries and inviting the participants. Then at the event, once our facilitator has set the scene and explained the essentially self-regulating process, your group is unleashed to discuss and tackle aspects of the issue that they feel strongly about. Open Space runs on two fundamentals: passion and responsibility. Passion engages the participants and responsibility ensures that the deliverables occur.<br>
<br>
TYPICAL OUTPUTS from an Open Space meeting, in the form of a written report generated by the end of the session, can include ideas, insights, related issues consolidated, priorities identified, proposals, initial action plans laid out, and enthusiastic task groups created from amongst the participants.<br>
<br>
The event can last anywhere from 1 day (raise and discuss key issues only) to 2 1/2 days (generate a set of proceedings that includes prioritized issues, recommended initiatives and names of participants committed to implementing the various action plans back at work.) The Open Space methodology works well with groups of from 10 to 1000 participants. There simply is no more efficient way to bring a wide group of people together to address a complex issue and converge on focused action.<br>

                            What Participants Will Learn<br>
<br>
 Communicating your performance expectations unambiguously<br>
 How to get the employee in touch with what motivates him/her at work<br>
 Leading the performance discussion in a non-directive way<br>
 Keeping the conversation on an &quot;adult-to-adult&quot; level<br>
 How to position responsibility with the underperforming individual<br>
 Recognizing good performance<br>
 Four effective assertive verbal approaches<br>
<br>
Overview<br>
<br>
Questions often asked about performance:<br>
<br>
 &quot;I have an employee whose performance has been continuously and irritatingly marginal? What can I do to get him/her to do a fully satisfactory job? When should I give up?&quot;<br>
 &quot;What factors might motivate different people to do the job we are paying them for? How can I, their manager, tap into that motivation?&quot;<br>
 &quot;How can I give corrective feedback to employees so that I get my message across clearly and, at the same time, maintain their self-respect?&quot;<br>
 &quot;When I have to confront an employee about his/her poor performance, how do I deal with side-tracks, victim mentality and counterattacks?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Where does coaching fit in to all this?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dealing with a poor performer is the single toughest task that your managers are required to do. They don&#39;t really teach this skill at either MBA school or the &quot;school of hard knocks.&quot; Furthermore, most managers do not understand human motivation (beyond money) and how they can leverage an employee&#39;s particular skills and motivators to generate solid performance.<br>
<br>
Not comfortable engaging in these tough conversations, many managers avoid the poor performance issue altogether or, alternatively, come at it like a steamroller-threaten, shame, or manipulate the staffer to do better. What usually results is resistance, no change in behavior, lingering resentment on the part of both parties, and lower morale in the work group.<br>
<br>
In this one-day, technique-packed workshop, learn how to conduct those difficult performance-correcting discussions with your employees in a non-acrimonious, problem-solving atmosphere. As a result, You will reduce your stress and position the responsibility for current performance and improvement-where it belongs-on the shoulders of the employee.<br>
<br>
It is possible, with your influence, to turn around many employees who up-to-now have been taking up altogether too much of your time and energy. Learn how.<br>
<br>

                            Management Development for a Competitive Edge<br>
For Engaged Employees<br>
In todays complex, volatile world, every organization seeks a sustainable edge. Companies struggle to create a marked advantage over their market rivals. Non-profit and public organizations seek to exceed their stakeholders ever-increasing expectations.<br>
<br>
A growing body of research reveals that the surest route to a sustainable edge is a workforce of highly engaged employees.These are individuals willing to contribute discretionary effort and creativitychoosing to go above and beyond expectationsto further their organizations success.<br>
<br>
However, resent studies by Towers Perrin and Blessing-White found that only 3 out of 10 North American workers are fully engaged. Even more distressing, close to 20% are actively disengaged! These latter are typically the ones who spread contagious negativity.<br>
<br>
How do you create a culture of high engagement in your organization?<br>
<br>
How do you turn around your less engaged employees and remove this drag on maximizing results?<br>
<br>
Outstanding leadership at the top is certainly a key part of the answerbut it is not enough! Your top team may be the most visionary, strategic, forward thinking, inspiring group around, but without strong leadership at all levels of your management team you cant foster highly engaged employees or the positive impact they will have on your enterprises capacity.<br>
<br>
Your managers are the missing link.<br>
This is where The Skillful Leader comes in.<br>
<br>
Its your mid-level management team that turns the vision and goals into action and results. They are the ones who directly motivate and engage your employees.<br>
<br>
We have designed The Skillful Leader to help them do exactly that.<br>
<br>
This program covers the range of managerial skills that are essential for fostering an engaged workforce. Blending interpersonal effectiveness with a strong orientation toward business results, these competency areas include self-awareness, interacting with others, leading staff, and focusing everyone on achieving maximum performance.<br>
<br>
10 things The Skillful Leader will teach your managers to do:<br>
<br>
1. Increase their leadership effectiveness, generating greater results.<br>
2. Manage themselves and their time in order to accomplish business priorities.<br>
3. Identify and leverage their own unique leadership strengths and style.<br>
4. Inspire their people to action through the power of shared vision.<br>
5. Align the actions of their people with their organizations strategy.<br>
6. Build a culture of employee engagement, personal accountability, ongoing innovation, and high productivity.<br>
7. Know when and how to delegate in a way that ensures quality results while developing the employee.<br>
8. Develop their direct reports to their potential.<br>
9. Conduct honest performance management conversations that motivate, rather than demoralize, their people.<br>
10. Engage effectively with a wider variety of personality types.<br>
<br>
The Process<br>
The Skillful Leader development process combines (1) group learning, (2) individualized coaching and (3) post-program reinforcement. Together, these elements promote lasting behavior change.<br>
<br>
Group Learning<br>
Our six-day classroom training is divided into three 2-day segments, scheduled three to six weeks apart. This phasing of sessions allows participants to implement and practice back on the job a few new behaviors at a time. Each workshop employs a rich variety of learning techniques, including:<br>
<br>
 Theory/concept presentations<br>
 Stories and examples<br>
 Hands-on skill practice<br>
 Skill demonstration by the presenter<br>
 Coaching in class<br>
 Videos demonstrating how to do (or not to do) certain skills<br>
 Small group discussions<br>
 Individual reflection<br>
 Problem-solving on real situations from participants workplace<br>
 Role-playing<br>
 Simulations<br>
 Concrete action planning for back at work<br>
<br>
Individual Coaching<br>
Every participant receives a one-hour coaching session with one of our facilitators after each two-day segment (a total of three hours of coaching). We help them understand any material on which they are not clear. We both challenge and encourage them to try out and practice newly learned behaviors. And we support them around any skills which they find particularly difficult to apply<br>
<br>
Post-Program Support<br>
Following the six-day program, we reinforce behavior change in several ways:<br>
 For a full year your participating managers receive a monthly e-mail that highlights a key lesson from the curriculum and introduces new ideas and tips not presented in class.<br>
 We conduct a debrief with your executive team to share our observations about the group and discuss ways in which you can support the transformation from new skills to permanent behavior.<br>
 For six months after the last classroom day participants are welcome to contact any of the presenters with questions or issues relating to managing their people.<br>

                            Executive Leadership Development for a Competitive Edge &amp; Strategic Advantage<br>
<br>
Most organizations want to be among the best in their industry or their field. They want to win in the marketplace or excel as a public or non-profit enterprise.<br>
<br>
How does your enterprise become the front-runner and maintain that position?<br>
<br>
You may try investing in any number of elements you hope will give you a strategic advantage, such as<br>
<br>
 The latest technology<br>
 A better supply chain<br>
 Process improvements<br>
 New products or services<br>
 Outsourcing non-core functions<br>
<br>
But the reality is that your competitors can do the same thing! Increasingly, strategic factors such as these are merely the price of admission to the game. They cant differentiate you for any length of time.<br>
<br>
The best guarantee of an enduring edge is a group of employees who are engaged, enthusiastic, and committed to the organizations mission and goals.<br>
<br>
Great Leadership<br>
So, what does it take to create that kind of workforce?<br>
<br>
Great leadership that starts at the top and permeates every layer of your organization.<br>
<br>
Having good enough leaders at the top is, simply, not good enough<br>
<br>
If you want to maximize your organizations capacity to deliver you need great leaders at the top. In fact, a recent study on leadership by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman found that the top 10% of leaders created double the net income generated by leaders in the next 80%.<br>
<br>
The Authentic Leader* equips your executives to increase their impact on your organizations capacity.<br>
<br>
Our four-step process carefully integrates peer feedback, one-on-one coaching and a powerful experiential workshop to help your leadership team members adopt the mindset that research has identified in extraordinary leaders. The process challenges your leaders to make a significant shift<br>
<br>
From:<br>
 Being cautious and playing not to lose<br>
 Controlling and dictating<br>
 Criticizing others or remaining detached<br>
 Going along to be liked<br>
<br>
To:<br>
 Achieving results and playing to win<br>
 Bringing out the best in others<br>
 Productively engaging with people<br>
 Being courageously authentic<br>

                            What Participants Will Learn<br>
<br>
 How to build your relationship with your manager<br>
 Understanding your managers style, pressures, goals, priorities and preferred way of interacting<br>
 Personal success requires an accountability (vs. blaming) mindset<br>
 How to exhibit leadership from your level<br>
 Determining what you really want from your work (i.e. your current motivators)<br>
 How to express your ideas and needs clearly and assertively<br>
 Soliciting feedback to increase your effectiveness, credibility and career potential<br>
 How to manage your own job performance and work objectives<br>
 How to be a partner in the Performance Management Process<br>
<br>
Overview<br>
<br>
NOTE: In our leadership training we show how to shift accountability to your employee for meeting job performance standards and the completing tasks satisfactorily and on-time.<br>
<br>
Managers in these courses have often said to us, You are teaching us how to hold our employees accountable for their performance. If only our employees would step forward and accept that personal accountability. Do you have a workshop for them?<br>
<br>
Managing Up is exactly the course managers have been asking for!<br>
<br>
It mirrors, for your staff, the flip side of what we teach your managers. Here we train employees how to take on accountability for their own job performance and career development.<br>
<br>
This workshop challenges your individual contributors: If they want to get ahead or even just have a good experience in their current jobthey must start treating their boss and others in management as their customers.<br>
<br>
We show your employees how this calls for a shift in their mindset. We discuss the courage it takes to make and keep commitments and to speak their mind. Participants are given ample opportunity for reflection to identify:<br>
<br>
 What their responsibility is for their job satisfaction and performance<br>
 Their managers situationwhat they imagine he or she is facing<br>
 What they want from their job and to what extent they are still getting it<br>
 What they think their current brand image is in the organization<br>
 One current work goal and how they can progress to achieving it<br>
<br>
Points Regarding This Program<br>
<br>
 Target audience is primarily non-supervisory staff and individual contributors. It is also very suitable, by the way, for supervisors and managers in their other roleas employees.<br>
 A great training strategy is to first put your managers through our The Skillful Leader and then cycle your entire staff through Managing Up.<br>
 This course has plenty of participant involvement, including small group discussions, personal reflection and application activities.<br>
 We have integrated two excellent videos into the program: &quot;Courageous Followers, Courageous Leaders&quot; and &quot;Accountability that Works.&quot;<br>

                            What is Leadership Coaching?<br>
<br>
Leadership Coaching is a series of periodic one-on-one consultations, in person or by phone, between a manager and his or her coach. The coaching process typically lasts anywhere from three to seven months but, depending upon the complexity of the issues, may continue several months longer. Generallybut not alwaysit begins with administration of a 360º feedback assessment prior to concentrated work with the coach.<br>
<br>
You should look at coaching as a focused, scalpel strategy for the leadership development of an individual manager. For coaching to succeed, there must be two commitments established up-front:<br>
<br>
1. By the individual manager to work hard to achieve the agreed-upon outcomes.<br>
2. By the organization, particularly the managers immediate boss, to support his or her efforts in every way possible.<br>
<br>
Coaching begins by clarifying among the manager (i.e. the client), his/her immediate boss, and the coach the agreed upon measurable or observable outcomes of the process. Frequently a representative of Human Resources is also involved.<br>
<br>
Between coaching sessions the manager applies newly learned approaches, skills, and behavior at work, observes the impact, and then with the aid of the coach refines his/her approach accordingly.<br>
<br>
What are the benefits of coaching?<br>
<br>
 The manager zeroes in on the specific skills and behaviors that are essential to his/her ability to perform.<br>
 Desired behavior change takes place quickly due to immediate, real time application of learning back on the job.<br>
 The manager begins to demonstrate improved results very soon.<br>
 Greater productivity, higher morale, and lower turnover among the managers staff, due to his/her improved effectiveness as a leader and communicator.<br>
<br>
Where can Leadership Coaching really make a difference?<br>
1. When performance as a leader is not meeting expectations.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;A key individual at a relatively senior level in your organization has reached a critical juncture. On one hand, his strong technical knowledge and experience means he has a lot to contribute. On the other hand, his interpersonal style is seriously limiting his ability to work effectively with others. Despite discussions you have had with him, he doesnt seem to know how to make the needed changes. You dont want to let him go but the negative impact of his style is now outweighing the positive elements he contributes to the organization.<br>
<br>
2. Developing skills for growth in current and future positions.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
A strong performer was recently promoted, transferred or hired into a new challenging leadership role, one that is stretching her talents.&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;Or, perhaps you have an identified high potential employee who has been in her current role for a while and it is now time to prepare her for advancement to a more complex leadership role.<br>
<br>
3. Senior leader seeks a trusted advisor.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
A leader has few, if any, people with whom he can talk candidly about the challenges he faces. Rather than needing regular, focused coaching conversations, what he wants is to be able to contact a coach/advisor on an ad hoc basis whenever he confronts a demanding situation or has an issue he wants to kick around and get advice on.<br>
What needs to be in place for your investment in coaching to pay off?<br>
Five Questions to ask before investing in coaching:<br>
<br>
1. Will the identified changes result in significantly better performance results?<br>
2. Is customized development required (vs. sending him/her on a skills training seminar)?<br>
3. Are the development issues sufficiently complex to call for focused guidance over a period of time<br>
4. Is the individual genuinely willing (i.e. without feeling coerced) to be coached?<br>
5. Are there circumstances involved that call for a private approach, sensitivity, and confidentiality?<br>
<br>
What process for Leadership Coaching do you use at Fulcrum?<br>
<br>
To quote management expert Peter Block, We are born on the wrong side of our eyes. Our approach is to enable the client to see his or her own behavior, from outside himself/herself. We work not just at the skill and behavior level. We also bring into the process the clients assumptions, attitudes, habits of thought, and values which combine to significantly drive his/her behavior.<br>
<br>
Our instruments of choice are The Leadership Circle Profile and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®.<br>
